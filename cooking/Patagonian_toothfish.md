## What 

### Overview

The Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) is a species of notothen found in c**old waters** (1–4 °C or 34–39 °F) between depths of 45 and 3,850 m (150 and 12,630 ft) in the **southern Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans** and Southern Ocean on seamounts and continental shelves around most Subantarctic islands.

A close relative, the Antarctic toothfish, (Dissostichus mawsoni) is found farther south around the edges of the Antarctic shelf; and a Marine Stewardship Council-certified fishery is active in the Ross Sea.

The average weight of a commercially caught Patagonian toothfish is 7–10 kg (15–22 lb), depending on the fishery, with large adults occasionally exceeding 100 kilograms (220 lb). They are thought to live up to 50 years[1] and to reach a length up to 2.3 m (7.5 ft). Several commercial fisheries exist for Patagonian toothfish, which are detailed below.

### Name 

This species is also sold in the trade under the culinary names Chilean seabass in the United States and Canada; merluza negra in Argentina, Peru, and Uruguay; legine australe in France; mero in Korea, Japan, and Spain, and bacalao de profundidad in Chile.[2]

The name "Chilean seabass" was invented by a fish wholesaler named Lee Lantz in 1977. He was looking for a name that would make it attractive to the American market.[3] He considered "Pacific sea bass" and "South American sea bass" before settling on "Chilean sea bass".[4] In 1994, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration accepted "Chilean seabass" as an "alternative market name" for Patagonian toothfish,[4] and in 2013 for Antarctic toothfish.

In the UK, the approved commercial designations for D. eleginoides and D. mawsoni are "icefish" and "toothfish".[5] This has created some confusion, as a genuine "icefish" (Champsocephalus gunnari) caught in subantarctic waters does not resemble toothfish in any way.

## FAQs

#### Q: keywords vs ?

A: 

#### Q: Interesting story about Chilean sea bass?

A: 

First one is this kind of ugly beast of the deep, the Patagonian toothfish that has been on restaurant menus for years. It just was never very popular. Would you order it yourself on a menu in a restaurant? Probably not. If you saw the picture, definitely not. But simply a little bit of rebranding calling this Chilean sea bass, exactly the same fish, looks still as ugly. But suddenly **sales increased by 1,300% in Australia, North America, in the UK** simply by **change of name**, completely changes our food behavior, what we choose to eat and what we don't. Sure, great food, but on top of that, you need to know what to call it.
