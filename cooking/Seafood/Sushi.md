### Overview

Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or [sɯꜜɕi]) is a traditional Japanese dish of prepared **vinegared rice** (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a **variety of ingredients** (ネタ, neta), such as **seafood**, often **raw**, and **vegetables**. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).[1]

Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with **seafood**, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled **ginger** (gari), **wasabi**, and **soy sauce**. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.

Sushi is sometimes confused with **sashimi**, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw fish, or occasionally meat, and an optional serving of rice.[2]
