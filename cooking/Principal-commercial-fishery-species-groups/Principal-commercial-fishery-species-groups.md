## Why 

* Rich source of Protein
* Plenty of Omega-3 Fatty Acid: ω−3与ω−6脂肪酸均为必须从食物中获取的必需营养素

**Fatty fish** are abundant sources of **[omega-3 fatty acids](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Omega-3_fatty_acid)**, healthy unsaturated fats that have been linked to **lower blood levels** of beta-amyloid—the protein that forms damaging clumps in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease. Try **to eat fish at least twice a week**, but choose varieties that are **low in mercury**, such as **salmon**, **cod**, canned light tuna, and pollack. If you're not a fan of fish, ask your doctor about taking an omega-3 supplement, or choose terrestrial omega-3 sources such as flaxseeds, **avocados**, and walnuts. - [Foods linked to better brainpower](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/foods-linked-to-better-brainpower)
