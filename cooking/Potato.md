Ingredients:

* Potato: 1 inch
* Olive Oil: 1/2 tbsp
* Kosher Salt: 1 tsp
* Groud Black Pepper: 1/2 tsp
* Dried Oregano: 1 tsp
* Garlic Powder: 1/2 tsp
* Thyme Leaves: 1 tsp
* Olive Oil: 1/2 tbsp for searing (Optional)

1 oz = 2 tbsp = 6 tsp

Step:

1. **Wash and cut potatoes**:  Cut them into 1-inch cubes. 
2. **Rub with oil and seasonings**: Rub the potatoes with olive oil, seasonings and herbs.
3. Place the seasoned potatoes into a **zip-top bag** (I also used a sous vide weight to prevent the bag from floating). Arrange the potatoes in a single layer, and Vacuum-seal the bag using the “water displacement” technique.
4. Cook in the sous vide water bath at **190°F (88°C)** for **1 hour**. Make sure the potatoes are fully submerged. If your bag is floating, you can use heavy kitchen items like kitchen tongs or saucepan to weight the bag down. (Keep the seams above the water)
5. **Sear** the potatoes (**optional**): Remove potatoes from the bag, and you can eat them as is. They are delicious. I like to take them to a new level by searing them quickly to get the crispy edges (remember to pat dry with paper towels before searing). 


PRO TIPS

* Arrange the potatoes **in one single layer** in the zip-lock bag so that they can get cooked properly.
* To prevent the vacuum-sealed bags from floating, you can use sous vide weights or heavy kitchen items such as metal tongs to keep it fully submerged.
* **Sear the potatoes** after sous vide cooking will add the nice and crispy edges to the potatoes.
* Some other great seasoning ideas include paprika, onion powder, chili powder, etc.




## What 

### Overview

The potato is a **root vegetable** native to the Americas, a **starchy tuber** of the plant Solanum tuberosum, and the plant itself is a perennial in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.

Wild potato species, originating in modern-day Peru, can be found throughout the Americas, from the United States to southern Chile.[3] The potato was originally believed to have been domesticated by indigenous peoples of the Americas independently in multiple locations,[4] but later genetic testing of the wide variety of cultivars and wild species traced a single origin for potatoes. In the area of present-day southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia, from a species in the Solanum brevicaule complex, potatoes were domesticated approximately 7,000–10,000 years ago.[5][6][7] In the Andes region of South America, where the species is indigenous, some close relatives of the potato are cultivated.
