from [What is stream processing?](https://www.ververica.com/what-is-stream-processing)

## Why?

- Applications and analytics react to events **instantly**
- Stream processing can handle data volumes that are **much larger** than other data processing systems
- Stream processing naturally and **easily** models the continuous and timely nature of most data
- Stream processing **decentralizes** and **decouples** the infrastructure

Before stream processing, this data was often stored in a database, a file system, or other forms of mass storage. Applications would query the data or compute over the data as needed.

Stream Processing turns this paradigm around: The application logic, analytics, and queries exist **continuously**, and data flows through them continuously.



## What?

> Stream processing is the processing of data in motion, or in other words, computing on data directly as it is produced or received.

## How?

- Lambda/Kappa
- Apache Spark
- ...
