## What 

### Overview

Docker is a set of **platform as a service** (PaaS) products that use **OS-level virtualization** to deliver software in **packages** called **containers**. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. All containers are run by a single operating system kernel and therefore use fewer resources than virtual machines.

The service has both free and premium tiers. The software that hosts the containers is called **Docker Engine**. It was first started in 2013 and is developed by Docker, Inc.
