# Persistence

> In computer science, persistence refers to the **characteristic** of state that outlives the process that created it. 
> 
> This is achieved in practice by storing the state as data in computer data storage. Programs have to transfer data to and from storage devices and have to provide mappings from the native programming-language data structures to the storage device data structures.

> Picture editing programs or word processors, for example, achieve state persistence by saving their documents to files.
