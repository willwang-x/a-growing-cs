## What 

### Overview

In computing, **a log file** is a file that records either **events** that occur in an operating system or other software **runs**,[1] or **messages** between different users of a communication software. Logging is the act of keeping a log. In the simplest case, messages are written to a single log file.

A transaction log is a **file** (i.e., log) of the communications between a system and the users of that system, or **a data collection method** that automatically captures the type, content, or time of transactions made by a person from a terminal with that system. For Web searching, **a transaction log** is an electronic record of interactions that have occurred during a searching episode between a Web search engine and users searching for information on that Web search engine.

## FAQs

#### Q: log file vs do file?

A: A do-file is a series of commands to be executed in the correct sequence. Do-files document **what you did** and they are also a good way to identify and correct any mistakes that have been made. Log-files are Stata **output files**. They also include the documentation of what you did and also your results.
