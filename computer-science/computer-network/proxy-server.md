> In computer networking, a proxy server is a server **application** or appliance that acts as an **intermediary** for **requests** from **clients** seeking **resources** from **servers** that **provide** those resources. [[wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Proxy_server)]

## Why 

Instead of connecting **directly** to a server that can fulfill a requested resource, such as a file or web page, the client directs the request to the **proxy server**, which evaluates the request and performs the required network transactions. This serves as a method to 

* **simplify** or control the complexity of the request, or 
* provide additional **benefits** such as load balancing, privacy, or security. 

Proxies were devised to add structure and encapsulation to distributed systems.

## What 

### Overview

In computer networking, a proxy server is a server **application** or appliance that acts as an **intermediary** for **requests** from **clients** seeking **resources** from **servers** that **provide** those resources. A proxy server thus functions on behalf of the client when requesting service, potentially **masking** the true origin of the request to the resource server.

Instead of connecting directly to a server that can fulfill a requested resource, such as a file or web page, the client directs the request to the proxy server, which evaluates the request and performs the required network transactions. This serves as a method to simplify or control the complexity of the request,[2] or provide additional benefits such as load balancing, privacy, or security. Proxies were devised to add structure and encapsulation to distributed systems.[3]
