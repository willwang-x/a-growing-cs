|23|大家都有酒了吗  我要开始感恩节祝酒了||Does everyone have a glass? I'm just giving my Thanksgiving toast.
|24|拜托老爸  你不觉得这样很怪吗 每年都要选一个不知为何 反正就是让你觉得格外骄傲的人||Oh, come on, Dad. Isn't it weird that  every year you single out one person  who somehow made you extra proud this year?
|27|这让我们其他人觉得... 是你  克莱尔||It makes the rest of us feel like we -- It's you, Claire.
|29|真棒  我就知道||Yeah! I knew it!
|30|还有你  菲尔  米奇尔||And you, Phil, and you, Mitchell.
|31|实际上是你们所有人||Actually, it's all of you.
|32|我知道我在家庭中引发竞争 你们都对我都颇有微词 但瞧瞧结果||I know I get a hard time for stirring up competition in the family, but look at the results.

|38|而米奇尔吓跑了那个小偷||And Mitchell scaring away that burglar.
|39|你也是赢家  杰||And you are a winner, too, Jay.
|40|他想跟乔共度更多时光 所以他每天 都送他上学  接他放学||He wanted to spend more time with Joe, so he's dropping him off and picking him up from school every day.
|43|爸爸  她怎么了||Dad, what is wrong with her?
|44|我挑战她 一周内走十万步||I challenged her to get to 100,000 steps in a week.
|46|-那很容易  -真容易||- That's easy. - That's so easy.
|47|不算购物||Without shopping.
|48|-我明白挑战难处了  -不 她还剩1000步就获得荣誉了||- I get -- I get the challenge. - No.  She's 1,000 steps from glory.
|50|跟你们一样 她的动力来源于我吝啬赞美||Like the rest of you, she was motivated by my stingy praise.
|52|我环顾四周  看到的全是赢家 我感到十分骄傲||As I look around the room, I see nothing but winners, and I couldn't be prouder.
|54|敬我们||To us!
|55|这里的每个人都是赢家||Everyone here is a winner.
|57|你知道这场重要比赛让我很紧张 所以你拿出了我的  好吧||You knew I was nervous about the big game, so you set out my -- Okay.
|59|糖屑是给英雄准备的||Sprinkles are for heroes.
|60|给  二爸||Here, Daddy.
|61|谢谢你保护我们||Thank you for protecting us.
|62|我们都为米奇尔那天做的事感到骄傲||We're all so proud of Mitchell about what happened the other day.
|63|我的想法是我们可以...||What I was thinking was, we could...
|64|天啊||Oh, my gosh!
|65|有人闯入了吗||Was there a break-in?
|66|对啊对啊  简直要疯了||Yeah, yeah. It was -- It was crazy.
|67|我当时就冲他吼叫 我好像就把他吓跑了  所以...||I just started yelling at him, and I guess I scared him away, so...
|69|天啊  亲爱的  你没事吧||Oh, my gosh, sweetie. Are you okay?
|70|是的  我没事||Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.
|71|-你真勇敢  -宝贝||- You're so brave. - Oh, honey.
|72|万分骄傲||So proud.
|73|如果小偷回来了  而勇敢二爸不在的话 -我们可以用这个  -不不||If the robber comes back when Brave Daddy isn't here, - we can use these. - Okay, no, no, no, no.
|75|那是我在学校没收的||I had to confiscate those at school.
|76|这很危险 而且你最好还是避开这种亚洲人爱玩的玩意||They're very dangerous, and, plus, you should avoid the cliche.
|78|没收违禁品是我在学校新工作的一部分||Confiscating contraband is part of my new job at school.
|79|我最近升职为 代理[演戏]副校长了||I was recently promoted to acting vice principal.
|81|这跟演戏毫无关系||Which has nothing to do with acting.

|84|你是在担心这场重要比赛吗||Are you -- Are you worried about the big game?
|85|是啊  我有些紧张||Yeah. I'm a little nervous.
|86|响尾蛇队过去六年里都打败了我们 而我们不能输||The Rattlesnakes have beat us the last six years, and we cannot lose.
|88|你这么紧张是因为他们的教练是女人吗||Is any of this because their coach is a woman?
|89|我们不该支持她吗  因为 因为她是另一个执教橄榄球的直女吗||I mean, shouldn't we be rooting for her, because -- Oh, what, because she's another straight person coaching football?
|91|-祝你好运  -谢谢你  亲爱的||- Well, good luck. - Thank you, sweetie.
|92|我无法保证我让你感受到的骄傲 和打跑了小偷的二爸一样多  但我会努力||You know, I can't promise that I'll make you as proud as your daddy  who fought off a burglar, but I will try.
|94|有传言说后援俱乐部 要把给我们的一些经费转给科学项目||You know, there's murmurs that the booster club is gonna divert some of our money to the science program.
|96|因为这样就能让肯尼迪们变酷 在草坪上玩科学什么的||Because that's what made the Kennedys cool, you know -- playing science on the lawn.
|98|第一个想出怎么把号码布一次贴到位的人 肯定能发大财||Ow! The first person who figures out how to stick these numbers  right on is gonna be rich.
|100|你可以在穿上背心之前先贴好啊||You could just pin it to your shirt before you put it on.

|102|艾丽克斯小时候  我会把她放进慢跑婴儿车里 她是我的跑步伙伴||When Alex was a baby, I used to throw her in a jogging stroller, and she was my running buddy.
|104|这周她得知我要跑一万米时 就坚持要来||This week, when she found out I was doing a 10K, she insisted on coming.
|106|无聊死了||Snore.
|107|我把我妈当做我的白痴心理学论文的对象 因为我开始太晚了  没法领走猴子了||I'm using my mom as a subject for my stupid psych paper because I started too late to sign out a monkey.
|109|论文是关于积极与消极强化的||It's about positive versus negative reinforcement.
|110|比赛前半程我会喊  "你能做到的  妈" 后半程则是  "算了吧  女人" 幸好  做完实验后 给猴子买的香蕉可以给她吃||First half of the race -- "You can do it, Mom!" Second half -- "It's not your day, lady!" Thankfully, after it's done, I'll still be able to give out the banana I bought.
|114|多谢你照顾乔||Thank you so much for taking care of Joe.
|115|我还得去店里买点晚餐食材||I still have to get some things from the store for dinner.
|116|没问题||It's no problem.
|117|我有很多知识可以传授||I got a lot of knowledge to pass on.
|118|你有在持续练习打嗝吗||You been practicing your burping drills?
|119|是的||Yes!
|120|-好些了  -好  闲聊完了||- Better. - Okay, enough chitchat.
|121|给我促销的VIP票||Give me the V.I.P. Pass for the sale.
|122|大家都听说过H.布朗夫曼服装的 黑五促销  那时候大伙儿 像动物一样疯狂争抢晚礼服||Everybody's heard of the H. Bronfman Clothiers Black Friday sale where the hoi polloi fight over tuxedos like animals.
|125|但是在感恩节 极少数人会受邀当第一批进场的买家||But on Thanksgiving Day, a select few are invited to get first crack.
|127|如果我能把要的都买齐 我的燕尾服就会在小姑娘房里脱到只剩两成||If I get everything I want, that tux will be 80% off in Tammy Bosworth's dorm room.
|129|黑金卡||Black gold.
|130|这是俱乐部成员当做小费给我的 他让我弄来几瓶灰雁伏特加||I got it as a tip from some club members who had me "deal" with some geese.
|132|你休想玷污这次体验||You will not taint this experience.
|133|克莱尔  你为什么贴着号码布||Claire, why do you have that number?
|134|你参加选美比赛了吗||Are you in a pageant?
|135|她要跑一万米  她的表现一定会很棒||She's running a 10K. And she is going to do great.
|136|我就知道你会让我们感到骄傲||I know that you're gonna make us oh-so proud!
|137|显然这本该是群抱 而我的邀请函在邮寄时遗失了||Obviously, this was meant to be a group hug, and my invitation got lost in the mail. Mm.
|139|菲尔  你为了变魔术 订的那个疯狂电话亭 已经在我家了||Phil... that crazy phone booth that you ordered for your magic trick -- It's already at my house.
|142|提前两天到了吗||It's here two days early?!
|143|我今天就能拍摄教程||I can shoot my how-to video today!
|144|海莉  好戏上演了 ||Haley! Showtime!
|145|毫无疑问  二战中 最伟大的魔术就是诺曼底电话亭||It goes without saying that the greatest trick to come out of World War II is the Normandy Phone Booth.
|147|多年来  它的名声时起时落||Over the years, its reputation has ebbed and flowed.
|148|众所周知  在1969年的 纳拉干塞特魔术节上它遭到了大家的喝倒彩||It was famously booed at the 1969 Narragansett Magic Festival.
|150|当然  那时候 大部分人都在抗议魔术||Of course, this is a time when most people are into protest magic.
|152|所以很自然  他们会对经典魔术嗤之以鼻  那就是一个英勇的士兵冲进电话亭 打了拯救世界的电话 而电话亭慢慢灌满了水||So naturally, they would thumb their nose at a classic trick where a heroic soldier dashes into a phone booth to make a world-saving call while it slowly fills with water!
|156|这多赞啊  嬉皮士们||Come on, hippies!
|157|天啊||God!
|158|小家伙  你出去玩吧||All right, buddy. Run outside and play real quick.
|159|我要去楼上忙些事||I'm gonna take care of something upstairs.
|160|我得更新我在 一款新社交媒体软件"内缝线"上的用户照片||I had to update my profile pic on this new social-media app called Inseam.
|162|这软件超酷的  基本还没人知道||It's super cool. No one knows about it.
|163|有些老家伙用它分享自制成衣 但之后两个布鲁克林DJ 开始在上面分享一些视频  然后就火了||Some old guys were using it for home tailoring, but then two Brooklyn deejays started sharing a couple of videos on it, and it blew up.
|166|太严肃了||Not approachable.
|167|太亲和了||Too approachable.
|168|完美||There's my guy.
|169|怎么了||What's up?
|170|伙计  我刚准备离开 结果在内缝线上看见了你的新照片||Dude, I was just about to leave, and I saw your new pic popped up on Inseam.
|172|你也用内缝线吗||You're on Inseam?
|173|是的  我已经用了一周了||Yes, I've been on it for a week.
|174|你看看照片  乔在你身后的树上||Okay, look at your picture. Joe is in a tree behind you.
|175|天啊  他就在那里||Oh, my God, he's right there!
|176|等等  乔||Hang on, Joe!
|177|喂||Hello?
|178|乔怎么了||What's going on with Joe?
|179|你也用内缝线吗||You're on Inseam?
|180|当然了||Of course I'm on Inseam.
|181|我儿子挂在树上了吗||Is my son hanging from a tree?
|182|真棒  你信了||Oh, that's great! You fell for it.
|183|我的改图技术越来越出神入化啊||I'm, uh -- I'm getting pretty good at Photoshop.
|184|那是假照片吗||That's a fake picture?
|185|是啊  我有许多张乔做危险事情的照片||Yeah, I got a bunch of Joe doing dangerous stuff.
|186|那你晚点给我看看  好吗||You're gonna have to show me this later, okay?
|187|没问题||Will do.
|188|都怪你 我现在满身大汗  都没办法 鉴定丝绸衬衫了||Well, thanks to you, now I'm all sweaty, and it's gonna be impossible to judge the silk shirts.
|191|应该宽松飘逸  而不是黏身上||They're supposed to blouse, not cling.
|192|能让我看看这张卡吗||Hey, can I see that card for a second?
|193|-你干什么  -等你把乔的头P到鳄鱼嘴里 我才会把这张卡交还给你||- What are you doing? - I'll put this card back in your hand when you Photoshop that kid's head in an alligator's mouth.
|195|上游河谷在二码线上 比赛时间还剩十秒||Upper Valley on the 2-yard line with 10 seconds to go.
|197|一个触地得分将会获胜||A touchdown will win the game.
|198|暂停  暂停||Okay, timeout! Timeout!
|199|加油  海豚队||Let's go, Dolphins!
|200|教练  我们怎么防守||Coach, what is our defense?
|201|好吧  按理说应该用奔跑达阵 但他们用传球虐我们一天了||Okay, you know what? It's a running situation, but they've been killing us with that pass all day.
|203|我的直觉认为他们要传球  但是... 好吧  让我想想||My gut tells me they're gonna pass, but Okay, just let me think about it.
|205|让开||Move. Move!
|206|那些蠢货 肯定会认为我们要传球  所以我们要奔跑||Those dumb bastards are going to be thinking pass, which is why we're going to run.
|208|左边用2包围防守||Trap Two, on the left side.
|209|我的副校长对讲机 不小心收听到了上游河谷教练 说出她的白痴娘们战术||My vice principal walkie-talkie accidentally picked up that Upper Valley coach calling her dumb lady play.
|212|我要改变我的防守策略吗||Now, was I gonna change my defense?
|213|只有没有骨气  全力争胜  追名逐利的人 才会选择赢  而不是展示高风亮节||Only some spineless win-at-all-costs glory hound would choose winning over showing some moral fiber.
|215|海豚队赢了  海豚队赢了||Dolphins win! Dolphins win!
|217|体育场里的所有人  包括我||Everybody in that stadium, including me...
|218|-是啊  -都以为对方会传球||- Well... - was expecting a pass.
|219|但你的直觉告诉你不会那样||But your instincts told you something else.
|220|真了不起  我的朋友||That's big-time, my friend.
|221|谢谢你这么说  杰  谢谢你||Well, I-I-I appreciate it, Jay. Uh, thank you.
|222|米奇尔||Mitchell!
|223|我是个骗子||I'm a fraud.
|224|那就别再和那个咖啡师吹牛 说你在百老汇做过沙威[悲惨世界]的替角||Well, then stop telling that barista that you understudied Javert on Broadway.
|226|他知道你叫什么  上网一查就发现了||He knows your name. He can look it up.
|227|不  我不小心在对讲机上 听到那个女教练的战术安排 然后我改了我的防守策略赢了比赛||No, I overheard the lady coach call her play on my walkie-talkie, and I changed my defense to win the game.
|230|现在我焦虑发作  我必须坦白||And now I'm having anxiety, and I have to confess.
|231|不行  你不能坦白||No, you-you are not gonna confess.
|232|你给我把焦虑揉成一个小球 再塞到你灵魂里那个专门用来 密封童年阴影的小洞里去||You're gonna smush that anxiety into a little ball, and you're gonna push it into that little, tiny hole in your soul where childhood traumas go.
|235|这里的所有人都是赢家||Everybody here is a winner.
|236|如果最后你成了饭桌上唯一的失败者 我仅有的收获会是所有人居高临下的同情||I-If you end up being the one loser at the table, I'm gonna get nothing but condescending pity from everybody.
|238|特别是克莱尔那副难以忍受的虚伪嘴脸||Especially Claire, that insufferable phony.
|239|太漂亮了||Hey, so pretty!
|240|-卢克  -歌洛莉亚||- Luke. - Hey, Gloria.
|241|你的刘海真好看||Sure love those bangs.
|242|为什么剪了刘海||What's the story with those?
|243|我知道你一直在躲着我 因为根本没有乔身处险境的合成照片||I know you have been avoiding me because there are no Photoshopped pictures of Joe in danger.
|245|而你这个问题的答案很简单 刘海衬我的脸||And the the answer to your question is very simple -- They frame my face.
|247|那些照片啊||Oh, those pictures.
|248|就在这||Here we are.
|249|乔捅蜂窝||Joe poking a bees' nest.
|251|乔射杀李·哈维·奥斯瓦尔德||Oh, and Joe killing Lee Harvey Oswald.
|252|真可爱||So cute.
|253|杰  卢克是个天才||Jay, Luke is a genius.
|254|谢了  伙计||Thanks, buddy.
|255|你可以去买高级衣服了||You can go do your fancy shopping now.
|256|太棒了  为了弥补我失去的时间 我要给脚后跟涂上油 试鞋时穿脱就快多了||Awesome. To make up for the time I lost, I'm gonna baby oil my heels so I can try on shoes faster.
|259|菲尔  你看过卢克合成的这些照片了吗||Phil, did you see this Photoshop stuff that Luke did?
|260|他真是个魔术师||He's a real magician.
|261|我想这是有其父必有其子||I guess he came by it honestly.
|262|这话对我来说意义非凡  杰||That means the world to me, Jay.
|263|我的人生是场谎言||I'm living a lie.
|264|克莱尔  这家里的每个人都是赢家 除了我||Claire, everyone in this family's a winner except for me.
|266|我变我变我变废柴||Abraka-failure.
|267|准备好灌水了吗||Ready to fill this thing up?
|269|我们之所以在这里拍 就是为了用泳池水  能重复利用||The-The whole reason we're here is to use the pool water, which is recyclable.
|271|我算是可持续魔术运动的大人物||I'm sort of a hero in the sustainable magic movement.
|272|我可不想失去三只环保绿兔的评级||I'd hate to lose my three green rabbits rating.
|273|好吧||Okay.
|274|我们这就开拍吗||Should we start filming?
|275|当然  好  当然||For sure. Yeah. For sure.
|276|我认为我或许该先休息一下||I-I-I think I'll-I'll probably just take a quick minute.
|277|年轻时我表演什么魔术都不害怕 任何被困在狭小空间的魔术都行 盒中狐  另一个牧羊人 爱因斯坦的鸟浴盆||As a young man, I had no fear of any trick where I was jammed into tight spaces -- Fox in a Box, The Wrong Shepherd, Einstein's Birdbath.
|281|不过最近  我多少有一点幽闭恐惧 通常我只要 给非常支持我的妻子打通电话就好了||Lately, though, I have had a touch of claustrophobia, which is usually cleared up by a quick call to my super-supportive wife.
|284|你终于接电话了||Oh, you finally picked up.
|285|不  没有紧急状况||No, no, it's not an emergency.
|286|我只是...你在听吗  克莱尔||I just -- Hello? Claire?
|287|等着你的指令呢  老爸||Just give me the word, Dad.
|288|好||Yep.
|289|我们||Let's...

|292|您好  恭喜您购买了这个 诺曼底电话亭||Hello, and congratulations on your purchase of the Normandy Phone Booth.
|294|接下来我将演示 您为生活"拨动"了多少乐趣||The following will demonstrate just how much fun you've...dialed up.
|296|今天就是登陆日||Here we are on D-Day.
|297|该死的空中支援在哪||Where's the damned air support?
|298|太好了||Oh, good.
|299|有个电话亭||A p-phone booth.
|300|我听说纳粹们在电话亭里设置了陷阱 但我...||I hear the Nazis have booby-trapped these, but I will...
|302|我绝对会以身犯险  给盟军司令部打电话||I definitely will take the risk of calling Allied Command.
|303|您好  上将||Hello, General.
|304|是的  我们被敌人包围了||Yes, the enemy is all around us.
|305|火力很猛||Blast!
|306|这个电话亭里设置了陷阱||This is one of the phone booths that's booby-trapped.
|307|不||Oh, no!
|308|是的  上将  敌人正在逼近||Yes, General, the enemy is closing in!
|309|我们无路可逃... 海莉  快放我出去||There's no esca- Haley! Get me out of here!
|311|海莉是谁  我是卢瑟福护士||Who's Haley? I'm Nurse Rutherford.
|312|如果我不能表演这个魔术 我的魔术用品店会沦为小型商场的笑柄||If I can't do this trick, my magic shop is gonna be the laughingstock of the mini-mall.
|314|而那里还有一家过时多年的租片店呢||And there's still a Blockbuster there.
|315|亲爱的  我知道你最近过得不顺 但你不能告诉别人 因为我们决不能成为今年家里的失败者||Honey, I know you're going through something, but you need to keep it to yourself, because we will not be the loser family this year.
|318|-克莱尔  -怎么||- Claire. - Yeah?
|319|我想到了一个天才点子||I had a genius idea.
|320|你的比赛路线正好经过普利切特衣橱||Your race went right by Pritchett's Closets.
|321|把保全摄像调出来||Pull the security tape.
|322|我们用你领先的画面冲副大广告 "普利切特  三十年来一直领先于他人" -天才  -太赞了  老爸  真棒||We'll blow up a frame of you in the lead and run a big ad -- "Pritchett's. Leading the Pack for 30 Years." - Genius! - I love it, Dad! Yes!
|325|我这就去||I am on that!
|326|我们有麻烦了||We have a problem.
|327|是我有麻烦了||I had a problem.
|329|你好||H-H-Hello?
|330|你好  该死||Hello -- Damn it.
|331|菲尔  你最好是有紧急状况||Phil, this better be an emergency.
|332|你终于接电话了||Oh, you finally picked up.
|333|不  没有紧急状况  我只是... 我在赛跑  歌单都因为你乱套了||No, no, it's not an emergency. I just -- I'm running a race, and you just screwed up my playlist!
|335|从那一刻起 我就不在赛跑路线上了||From that point on, I was no longer on the actual race course.
|337|谢谢你||Thank you!
|338|谢谢||Thanks.
|339|后来可能在某个转角我又兜回到比赛路线上||I guess I hit a point where I funneled back onto the course.
|340|我的确注意到我的体能 似乎比我前面的几个人充沛许多 但我当时没多想||I did notice that I seemed to have more energy  than the few people in front of me, but I didn't-I didn't think much of it.
|344|我做到了  我赢了我赢了||I did it! I won! I won!
|345|你看到了吗  宝贝  我赢了||Did you see that, honey? I won!
|346|不  你没赢||Uh, no, you didn't.
|347|我一直站在五千米标志那  根本没看到你||I was standing at the 5K mark and never saw you.
|348|-什么  -克莱尔||- What? - Claire!
|349|我刚才在商店里  我看到你赢了||I was at the store, and I saw you win!
|350|亲爱的||Oh, honey!
|351|我认识她||I know her!
|352|她是我继女||She's my stepdaughter!
|353|普利切特衣橱的保全摄像里 根本不会有你跑过去的画面 因为9.6公里的赛程你少跑了3公里||There's not gonna be any footage of you running past Pritchett's Closets because you cut two miles out of a six-mile race.
|356|你最好告诉外公你没赢||Better tell Grandpa you didn't win.
|357|你真是我的道德指南针||Oh, you are my moral compass.
|358|所以我今天一天都不想再和你说话了||Which is why I don't want to talk to you for the rest of the day.
|359|卢克||Luke!
|360|帮我个忙  不许多问||I need a favor, no questions asked.
|361|你需要什么  电话卡吗||What do you need? Phone cards?
|362|不  我需要你合成一张 我今天跑过普利切特衣橱的照片||No. I need you to Photoshop a picture of me from today running in front of Pritchett's Closets.
|364|没问题||No problem.
|365|-没问题  -我... 我想拍张你和克莱尔的照片||- No problem. - I -- I want to grab a picture of you and Claire.
|367|我想上传到内缝线账号上||I want to post it on my Inseam account.
|368|内缝线是什么||Oh, what's Inseam?
|369|我用来找自制成衣图样的软件||I use it for home tailoring.
|370|-克莱尔  -怎么||- Claire. - Yeah?
|371|你能过来一下吗||Could you get in here, please?
|372|-我的两个超级明星  -好啊||- My two superstars. - Okay!
|373|真不敢相信你膝盖不好还赢了比赛||Can't believe you won with that bad knee.
|374|还好  如果有人想偷奖牌的话 他们得和这兄弟过过招||Well, at least if somebody tries to steal that thing, they got to get through this guy.
|376|我不过是做了任何英雄会做的事||I just did what any hero would do.
|377|-没什么  -你化妆了吗||- It's... - Are you wearing makeup?
|378|是的  为了遮脸上的淤伤||Uh, well, yeah. I got a bruise.
|379|你不是说你一喊就把他吓跑了吗||I thought-I thought you screamed and he ran away?
|380|我们还是发生了肢体冲突的||Uh, well, there was a-there was a scuffle.
|381|你听从了本能||You went with your instinct.
|382|反抗还是逃跑  你反抗了||Fight or flight. You fought.
|383|我要把这张照片发到内缝线上||I'm gonna post this on Inseam.
|384|双击||Double-click.
|385|该死的||Damn it.
|386|你反抗了||You fought.
|387|你反抗了||You fought?
|388|你跟这个"闯空门的"多近距离接触了||How close did you get to this "intruder"?
|389|克莱尔  你差不多够了||Okay, Claire. That is just about enough.
|390|米奇尔遭受了创伤 我不喜欢你这种嘲讽的语气||Mitchell suffered a trauma, and I don't appreciate your mocking tone.
|392|容我们失陪  好吗||Excuse us. Okay?
|393|谢谢你  亲爱的||Thank you, sweetie.
|394|我们都能确定两件事 我穿珊瑚色特好看 你根本没打跑过任何闯空门的人||Okay, look, we both know two things for certain -- I look fabulous in coral, and you didn't fight off any intruder.
|397|这是有背景故事的||There-There is a backstory.
|398|1984年夏天 在《小子难缠》的影响下 我那阵子特别沉迷于武术||In the summer of 1984, inspired by "The Karate Kid," I went through a martial arts phase.
|401|当小卡把那副双节棍拿回家时 我实在是无法抗拒||When Cam brought those nunchucks home, it was just too much to resist.
|403|你好啊  老朋友||Hello, old friend.
|404|三十年后  又一次到了 使出扫堂腿  技惊四座的时候了||30 years later, once again, it was time to sweep the leg.
|406|天啊  不||Oh, God. Oh, no!
|407|-你为什么不和我说实话  -我不知道||- Why didn't you just tell me? - I don't know.
|408|你进门就问我是不是有人闯进来了 我当时很窘迫  还可能脑震荡了 所以我就顺水推舟||You-You walked in, and you asked if there was a break-in, and I-I was embarrassed and possibly concussed, so I just -- I went with it.
|411|再说不能让我爸和克莱尔知道  明白吗||Besides, my dad and Claire cannot know, okay?
|412|《小子难缠》上映的那年夏天  他们都叫我"功妇" 火鸡10分钟后就好了||That whole "Karate Kid" summer, they called me "Kung Sue." Turkey is gonna be ready in 10 minutes!
|414|-菲尔在哪  -我会告诉他||- Where is Phil? - I'll let him know.
|415|好||Okay.
|416|-再10分钟  -我做不来||- 10 minutes. - I can't take it!
|417|你就深呼吸  老爸||Just breathe, Dad.
|418|我们要克服你的恐惧||We are breaking this fear of yours.
|419|我要死了||I'm dying here!
|420|看着我||Look at me.
|421|你想要你的余生 都只是一名开放空间魔术师吗||Do you want to spend the rest of your life as an open-space magician?
|423|这就对了||Yeah.
|424|杰  我在内缝线上看到乔的学校举办了 感恩节大会||Jay, I saw on Inseam that there was a Thanksgiving pageant at Joe's school.
|426|你为什么没告诉我||Why didn't you tell me?
|427|我忘了嘛||I totally forgot.
|428|乔一周没上学了||Joe hasn't been in school for a week.
|429|我跟他的老师起了点争执||I had a falling-out with his teacher.
|430|然后被叫去校长办公室||And got sent to the principal's office.
|431|你对巴里什老师说了挺难听的话||You said some pretty harsh things to Mrs. Barrish.
|432|那是因为她在计划的餐会 不符合史实||In my defense, um, this banquet she's planning is not historically accurate.
|434|比如说  我不记得在首次感恩节餐会上 有印度咖喱鸡啊||For example, I don't remember a tandoori chicken option at the first Thanksgiving.
|436|我们学校有不同文化种族的孩子 我们想让大家都有参与感||We have children here from many ethnicities, and we try to make them all feel included.
|438|尽管如此  史书上也没写过餐会时  印第安人 请英国探险家帮忙递生鱼片寿司卷 而英国知名军官也在一旁 给自己来点无麸质墨西哥煎蛋||Be that as it may, history does not record Pocahontas asking John Smith to pass the sashimi roll while Myles Standish helps himself to gluten-free huevos rancheros!
|442|之后火气越来越大  我们被逐出学校||After that, it got heated, and we got expelled.
|443|"我们"吗||"We"?
|444|他们会打来的||But they'll call.
|445|始终需要我的银子||They need my check.
|446|为什么学校什么都没告诉我||Why didn't the school tell me anything?
|447|好像我不在电邮通知名单上了||It's like I am off their e-mail list.
|448|我都没看到过他的变装服||I didn't even see the costumes.
|449|他不用变装啊||Well, he didn't have a costume.
|450|他是解说员  他负责说出整个故事||No, he was the narrator. Kid told the whole story.
|451|宝贝||Ay, papi.
|452|你当时一定超可爱||You must have been so cute.
|453|晚餐的时候给大家表演一次吧||Why don't you perform it for everybody at dinner?
|454|我去拿我的手机  我们得录下来||I'll go get my phone, and we'll film it.
|455|-好吗  -没问题||- Okay? - Yes.
|456|小家伙  我得最快时间帮你补课||I gotta get you up to speed in a hurry, buddy.
|457|感恩节的故事  开始||The story of Thanksgiving. Here goes.
|458|没用||It's no use!
|459|我做不到||I can't do it!
|461|我了个去  她成功了||Sonuvabitch, she did it!
|462|你们看到了吗||See that, people?
|463|又一个超越自己巅峰的人  都感谢我||Another person doing their best, thanks to me.
|464|现在可以开吃了||It's time to eat.
|465|谷歌 火鸡还要多久||Hey, Google, how much time left on the turkey?
|467|两分钟||Two minutes.
|468|看到没  我能控制那个神经病甜甜圈 也成功达到十万步||See? I can control that crazy doughnut, I can do the steps.
|470|我做到了两件事 而其他人只做到了一件||I have two achievements, and the rest have only one.
|472|所以外公真的靠 说你做不到什么而激励了你是吧||So, Grandpa really motivated you by telling you you couldn't do something, huh?
|474|我要看看这个计步器  我写报告要用||I need to see that My StepCounter for a paper I'm writing.
|475|大家都成功做到了一些事 现在轮到乔了||Everybody achieved something today, so now it's Joe's turn.
|477|乔||Joe...
|478|跟我们说说第一个感恩节的故事||tell us about the first Thanksgiving.
|479|来吧  小家伙||Come up here, buddy.
|480|你能行||You got this.
|481|曾有一片大地住着不信神的原住民||There was once a land of godless natives.
|482|他们愚蠢无知 直到某天  白人们来了||They did not know any better until, one day, the white man arrived.
|484|这是什么鬼||What is this?
|485|白人们可怜这些原始人 教导他们如何耕种土地||The white man took pity on these primitives by teaching them to cultivate the land.
|487|但他们的善良被误会为侵略 所以战争开打了||But their kindness was mistaken for aggression, and a war began.
|489|这是哪门子的鬼学校||What kind of school is this?
|490|-我小时候学到的也是这样  -什么||- This is what I was taught. - What?
|491|最后  一切回归和平 我们还送给了他们我国最高荣誉 让他们冠名橄榄球队||Eventually, peace was restored, and we bestowed them with our nation's highest honor -- naming football teams for them.
|494|乔  这是什么短剧||Joe, what play is this?
|495|我没有演出短剧  我都没上学了||I wasn't in a play! I don't go to school anymore!
|496|好啦  对啦||All right, fine.
|497|我们被踢出来了可以吗||We got kicked out, okay?
|498|跟校长小小吵了一架||Little argument with the principal.
|499|你怎么可以骗我 亏我还一直夸你是个超棒的父亲||You've been lying to me while I was celebrating you as an amazing father?
|501|歌洛莉亚  奇怪了||Hey, Gloria, this is weird.
|502|我下载了你的计步器数据 到我电脑里 数据显示你今早走的路线 跟我妈妈去赛跑的路线是一样的||You know, I downloaded your My StepCounter data onto my computer, and it's showing your path this morning was the same route my mom took in her race.
|506|我怎么可能跑得到十万步||I was never going to get 100,000 steps.
|507|一直到后来我知道克莱尔要去火鸡赛跑||But then I learned that Claire was going on a Turkey Trot.
|508|第二次我抱她时 比第一次不容易  因为她浑身是汗||The second time I hugged her, it was a little harder because she was really wet.
|510|所以我基本上就是你的计步代跑骡吗||So I'm basically just your StepCounter mule?
|511|我还以为你在乎我这场跑步呢||I thought you cared about my race.
|512|我很爱你  克莱尔 但我对你运动真的很没兴趣||I love you very much, Claire, but your exercise doesn't really interest me.
|514|等等  克莱尔什么时候经过公司的来着||Hang on. When did Claire run past Pritchett's Closets?
|515|因为上面显示她压根就没靠近过那里||'Cause this thing says she never got near it.
|516|爸  估计是计步器出错了||Well, it's probably the StepCounter made a mistake.
|517|是吗  还是... 还是你绕捷径了||Oh, yeah, did it? Or -- Or -- Or did you take a little shortcut?
|519|才没有  应该是我跑太快 它都跟不上我的脚步||No, I was probably going so fast it couldn't even keep up with me.
|521|-我有照片为证  -让我看...||- I have a picture of it. - Let me see.
|522|卢克||Luke?
|523|你们看||And there you go.
|524|很清楚能看到我跑过普里契特衣柜公司||That is me clearly running in front of Pritchett's Closets.
|525|对啊  窗上还有 84年总统大选的海报呢||Oh, yeah, yeah. With a Reagan/Bush poster in the window, huh?
|527|照片是假的||The photo is a fake.
|528|不能怪我  是曼尼改的图||It's not my fault. Manny made it.
|529|曼尼改了所有的图吗||Manny was photoshopping everything?
|530|所以乔真的发生危险了吗||So Joe was in real danger?
|531|我没想到你这么轻易 就能把线索都连上||I did not realize how easy it would be for you to connect those dots.
|533|对你挺失望的  卢克||Pretty disappointed in you, Luke.
|534|他从哪学坏的  我想大家都懂||Well, you know, it's easy to see where he learned it from.
|535|他老妈就是个骗子||His mother's a cheater!
|536|什么  你少跟我搞这套义愤填膺的了||What?! Oh, don't get so hot and bothered. Uh-huh! Mm.
|537|-你的妆都要花了  你这...  -别碰我||- Your makeup's already running, and what do... - Stop it.
|538|你的淤青上有个中文字吗||Do you have a Chinese character on your bruise?
|539|估计是闯入的人打我时  他戒指的字印的||Yeah, it's probably an imprint from the intruder's ring.
|540|他...  我确定他肯定是混什么帮派之类的||He was -- I'm sure he was in a gang of some sort.
|541|老实交代吧  米奇尔||Just give it up, Mitchell.
|542|他玩我以代理副校长职权 没收的双节棍时不小心打到了自己||He knocked himself out with some nunchucks that I confiscated as acting vice principal.
|544|天啊  功妇又回来了||Oh, my God! Kung Sue is back.
|545|老爸  你听到了吗||Daddy, did you hear that?
|546|小卡  小卡不是靠实力赢的球赛||Well, Cam -- Cam didn't really win the football game.
|547|他从对方女教练那里偷听人家战术||Uh-huh. He stole the last play from the lady coach!
|548|是意外  我不小心在我做为代理副校长 必需要有的对讲机里听到的 我对这职位感到十分骄傲 因为我基本就是个警长||Accidentally! I overheard it on a walkie-talkie that I require as an acting vice principal, which is a position I'm pretty proud of because I'm basically a sheriff.
|552|-你才不...  -就是  我基本就是警长||- You're not basically -- No. Yes, I am basically a sheriff!
|553|我戴着帽子||I wear a hat!
|554|爸要表演那个魔术了  他从来没做过呢||Dad is doing his trick, and he's never done it before.

|559|我是一大家人生赢家里的唯一废柴||I'm the only loser in a remarkable family of winners.
|560|不不  不是的||No, no, no!
|561|我们才不是什么赢家||We are not all winners!
|562|其实我们全都是废柴||It turned out we all stink!
|563|无所谓了||It doesn't matter!
|564|不想要被恐惧支配我的人生||I don't want to live a life ruled by fear!
|565|我今天就得表演这个魔术||I have to do this trick today.
|566|不过有点越来越难呼吸了||Although, it is getting hard to breathe!
|567|别停  老爸  你可以的||Don't stop, Dad! You can do this!
|568|我对你有信心||I believe in you!
|569|-这话说了没用啊  宝贝  -有意思||- That's not helping, honey! - Very interesting.
|570|我一鼓作气做完吧||Okay, I'm just gonna try to barrel through this.
|571|这里是诺曼底  我是美国大兵托尼·兰切提||It's Normandy. I'm an American G.I. Named Tony Ranzetti.

|573|但我觉得我逃不出来了||But I don't think I'm gonna be able to get out!
