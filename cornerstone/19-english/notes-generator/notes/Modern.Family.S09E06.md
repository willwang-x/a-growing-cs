|25|00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,270|通往过去的魔法大门|a magic portal to the past,|
|26|00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,160|有些人称之为"时间机器"|what some might call a "Time machine."|
|27|00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,100|你们该"哇"了|This is where you guys go "Oooh."|
|28|00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,170|-不要  谢谢  -继续吧|- No, thank you. - Just get on with it.|
|29|00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:12,430|是的  "哇"|"Ooh," Indeed.|
|30|00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,600|我在办爸爸和歌洛莉亚的结婚十周年纪念派对|I'm throwing Dad and Gloria's 10th anniversary party,|
|31|00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,160|而菲尔是部分娱乐项目|and Phil is part of the entertainment.|
|32|00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,300|我要让歌洛莉亚在众人面前消失|I'm gonna make Gloria seemingly dematerialize,|
|33|00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,150|然后令人惊奇地穿越到过去|then wondrously travel back through time,|
|34|00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,480|最后穿着婚纱重新出现|and then rematerialize in her wedding dress.|
|35|00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,960|她要在箱子里换衣服|She's gonna change her clothes in a box.|
|36|00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,680|所以我对你在台上介绍我这事很紧张|This is why I'm nervous about you introducing me.|
|37|00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,960|我开玩笑的  你会表现得很棒的|I'm kidding! You're gonna be great.|
|38|00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,150|他最好发挥出色|He better be great.|
|39|00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,940|我希望爸爸和歌洛莉亚的派对十分完美|I want Dad and Gloria's party to be perfect.|
|40|00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,040|当年我在婚礼上还挺讨人厌的|I was kind of a pill at their wedding.|
|41|00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,020|我那时候还没完全接受歌洛莉亚|I hadn't fully accepted Gloria yet.|
|42|00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,910|而且我觉得我亲妈会如此下场我有一点责任|And I feel a little responsible for what happened with my mom.|
|43|00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,500|我在婚宴上灌了她三杯|I fed her, like, three drinks at the reception.|
|44|00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,070|想缓和一下气氛嘛|You know, just to take the edge off.|
|45|00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:46,110|我是歌洛莉亚  吻我  快吻我|I'm Gloria! Kiss me! Oh, hey, kiss me!|
|46|00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,640|不  天啊|No, no! Oh, geez!|
|47|00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,750|妈妈|Mom! Mom!|
|48|00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,400|她差点就把门框都扯掉了|She almost took the doorframe off.|
|49|00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,960|她进入了虫洞|Into the wormhole she goes.|
|50|00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,640|时钟倒转|Clocks turn backwards,|
|51|00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,030|日历重新一页页恢复|calendar pages re-attach themselves,|
|52|00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,450|看呀|and behold!|
|53|00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,800|美丽的新娘|The beautiful bride!|
|54|00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,210|各位  你们不觉得激动吗|Guys! This isn't exciting to you?|
|55|00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,360|用一下想象力啊|Use your imaginations.|
|56|00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,650|脑补到时候是我站在穿着新娘服的|Picture me standing next to Gloria|
|57|00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,090|歌洛莉亚旁边|in a wedding dress.|
|58|00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:11,570|就这样吧|We're done.|
|59|00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,110|米奇尔  你取蛋糕了吗|Mitchell, did you get the cake?|
|60|00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,650|嗯  我都搞定了|Yeah, yeah. I got everything.|
|61|00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,150|好  我得在爸爸家跟你碰头|Okay, good. I'll have to meet you at Dad's.|
|62|00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,520|我得跟菲尔一起去取魔法箱子|I need to go with Phil to pick up his magic box.|
|63|00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,630|你跟菲尔说了|Oh, and, hey, you told Phil|
|64|00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,470|别跟小卡提变魔术的事  对吧|not to mention the trick to Cam, right?|
|65|00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,170|如果小卡发现了  他会想让|If Cam finds out, he's just gonna want us|
|66|00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,870|我俩也表演一番的|to do some kind of performance, too.|
|67|00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:27,690|我蛮确定跟他说了别告诉小卡|Pretty sure I told him not to say anything.|
|68|00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,900|我蛮确定你没跟他说|Yeah, pretty sure you didn't.|
|69|00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,970|这是要干嘛|So, uh, what's all this?|
|70|00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,760|这是补偿|This is redemption.|
|71|00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,400|给我个直接的答案就好|Maybe just a straight answer.|
|72|00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,290|那年是2007年|The year was 2007 --|
|73|00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,930|杰和歌洛莉亚的婚宴|the wedding reception of Jay and Gloria.|
|74|00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,770|我们送新婚夫妇的礼物是二重唱|Our gift to the newlyweds was a duet performance|
|75|00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,640|-《溪中小岛》  -《溪中小岛》|- of "Islands in the Stream." - "Islands in the Stream."|
|76|00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,290|没送成这份礼物  因为|A gift that would never be, because...|
|77|00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,460|我记得|I remember.|
|78|00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,840|我在婚宴上灌了我妈妈几杯|I fed my mom a few drinks at the reception.|
|79|00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,260|我真的不想唱歌  所以我想|I really did not want to sing, so I figured|
|80|00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,910|如果我把她灌醉  我就没必要表演了|if I got her a little tipsy, I wouldn't have to perform|
|81|00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,600|因为我得握着她的手|because I'd have to hold her hand...|
|82|00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,390|不  天啊|No, no, no! Oh, geez!|
|83|00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,110|妈妈|Mom, Mom!|
|84|00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,140|之后挽着她的头发让她吐|...and later hold her hair back.|
|85|00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,760|你家人想象了十年  如果表演了会怎样|Well, your family has wondered for 10 years "What if?"|
|86|00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,480|今天  他们将得知答案|Today, they find out what for.|
|87|00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,350|我不确定  小卡|Mm, I don't know, Cam.|
|88|00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,770|我有些生疏了|I'm a little rusty,|
|89|00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,970|在帐篷里音响效果也不好|and acoustics are never good inside a tent.|
|90|00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,130|还有  这场派对的重点不是我们|And -- Oh! This party isn't about us.|
|91|00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,020|会有许多表演者|There's a whole slate of performers.|
|92|00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,280|歌洛莉亚要在箱子里换衣服|Gloria's changing in a box.|
|93|00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,100|这让我们的歌曲串烧更受欢迎了|Which makes our medley all the more welcome.|
|94|00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,210|现在成了歌曲串烧吗  不|It's a medley now? No! No.|
|95|00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,890|我今天绝对不可能以任何形态|In no way, shape, or form|
|96|00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,510|或者形式在我挑剔的家人面前表演|am I performing today in front of my judgmental family.|
|97|00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,950|好吧  我们就这么去派对吧|Fine. We'll just... go to the party.|
|98|00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,020|谢谢|Thank you.|
|99|00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,710|-不要歌曲串烧  -没错|- No medley. ‭- Exactly.|
|100|00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:46,970|等等  这不是什么陷阱吧|Wait. This isn't a trick --|
|101|00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,590|就三首没联系的歌曲|Just three un-related songs.|
|102|00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,780|你刚同意了  彩排现在开始|You just agreed. Rehearsal starts right now.|
|103|00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,010|准备好了就加入|Jump in when you're ready.|
|104|00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,150|为什么是你在做饭|Why are you cooking?|
|105|00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,700|妈妈有允许你待在这吗|Are you allowed back there?|
|106|00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,650|这是我们的结婚纪念日  |It's our anniversary. |
|107|00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,480|我不能为你妈妈做点好事吗|Can't I do something nice for your mother?|
|108|00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:04,960|也许吧|Maybe.|
|109|00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,270|早安  美女|Morning, beautiful.|
|110|00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,580|早餐有西式的煎鸡蛋  辣香肠  玉米薄饼|We have huevos, we have chorizo, we have tortilla.|
|111|00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,230|唯一缺的只有曼尼|What we ain't got is Manny.|
|112|00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:13,380|很遗憾  他今天不会出席派对|Unfortunately, he's gonna be a no-show at the party today.|
|113|00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:15,890|我有何能为你做的|What can I get you?|
|114|00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,790|把这些垃圾从我身边拿开|Take that garbage away from me.|
|115|00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,160|我要去散步|I'm going for a walk.|
|116|00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,600|曼尼是我们婚礼的一大亮点|Manny was a big part of our wedding.|
|117|00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,280|他牵着歌洛莉亚走上通道  还表演书法|He walked Gloria down the aisle, did the calligraphy.|
|118|00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,830|我知道他不参加我们的周年派对|And I knew him not showing up to our anniversary party|
|119|00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,710|会让歌洛莉亚心情很不好|would put Gloria in a bad mood.|
|120|00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,220|某种程度来说  我觉得自己有责任|In some ways, I feel responsible.|
|121|00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,020|你又回来了吗|You're home again?|
|122|00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,750|你都上大学了|You're in college.|
|123|00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,390|你不能每周末都回家啊|You can't come back every weekend!|
|124|00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,910|-都不拥抱一下吗  -我爱你|-So no hug? ‭-  I love you,|
|125|00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,850|但是你老待在这里  就不能最大程度地|but you're not making the most of your college experience|
|126|00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,240|体验到大学生活了|by being here all the time.|
|127|00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,520|我大一时  我父亲送我去学校|My father dropped me off my freshman year,|
|128|00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,090|我一直到来年春天才再见到他|and I didn't see him again till the spring.|
|129|00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,500|-想知道为什么吗  -我不知道|- You want to know why? - I don't know.|
|130|00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,010|跟姑娘和打架有关吗|Something about dames and fistfights?|
|131|00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,780|没错  我忙于交朋友|Exactly -- too busy making friends,|
|132|00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,860|泡妞之类的事情|chasing skirts, and things of that nature.|
|133|00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,710|但你母亲和我认为  总待在家里|But your mother and I think it's bad for you|
|134|00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,990|对你没好处|to be here all the time.|
|135|00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,050|所以赶紧走吧|So hit the road,|
|136|00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,440|我们感恩节再见|and we'll see you at Thanksgiving.|
|137|00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,040|等等  我被禁止进入自己的房子了吗|Wait. I'm banned from my house?|
|138|00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,450|别这样想|Don't think of it that way.|
|139|00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,430|你是被禁止进入我的房子|You're banned from my house.|
|140|00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,850|严格说来  歌洛莉亚没参与这一决定|Technically, Gloria was not in on this decision,|
|141|00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,260|意思就是|in the sense that...|
|142|00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,870|她不知道这个决定|she was not in on this decision.|
|143|00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,430|我有点在闹脾气|I was a little grumpy.|
|144|00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,560|我同意在派对上跟菲尔一起|I had agreed to do this magic trick|
|145|00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,100|表演这个魔术|at the party with Phil.|
|146|00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,520|我要进入一个箱子里|I go into a box,|
|147|00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,620|然后穿着我的婚纱出来|and then I come out in my wedding dress.|
|148|00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,720|但是有个问题|But there was a problem.|
|149|00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,820|拉|Pull!|
|150|00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,090|拉不动啊|She won't budge!|
|151|00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,420|唯一合理的解释就是|The only logical explanation|
|152|00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,890|有人溜进了我的衣柜|is that somebody snuck into my closet|
|153|00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,850|把我的婚纱缩小了|and shrunk my wedding dress.|
|154|00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,100|比如我妹妹|Like, probably my sister.|
|155|00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,240|所以过去这周|So for the past week,|
|156|00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,320|我在努力减肥|I've had to, like, get even skinnier|
|157|00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,070|要比我结婚时还要瘦|than I was at my wedding.|
|158|00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,070|你闭嘴|Oh, shut up.|
|160|00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,460|别丢人|Be cool.|
|161|00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,570|菲尔  这是魔术商店|Phil, it's a magic shop.|
|162|00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,750|我是来过这店里最不丢人的那个人了|I'm the coolest person that's ever been in here.|
|163|00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,710|他怎么做到的|How does he do it?|
|164|00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,700|我开玩笑的  我知道他怎么弄的|I'm kidding. I know how he does it.|
|165|00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,120|克莱尔  这位就是传奇的飙眼先生|Claire, meet the legendary Mister Ekshun.|
|166|00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,760|你好|Hello.|
|167|00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,790|你耳朵后面是什么|And what's this behind your ear?|
|168|00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,780|毛衣掉毛了而已|Oh, just some sweater fluff.|
|169|00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,510|这地方太棒了|Well, the place looks great.|
|170|00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,090|你能想象天天来这里吗|Can you imagine coming here every day?|
|171|00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,980|真希望是每天都来|I wish it was every day.|
|172|00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,910|我现在那么多巡演要去|I have less and less time for the old Illusionatorium,|
|173|00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,890|越来越没时间打理幻想殿堂了|with all the road jobs I still book.|
|174|00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,650|你可以快速再给我过一遍|Would you mind quickly walking me through|
|175|00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,650|量子涨落魔术吗|the Quantum Flux Illusion?|
|176|00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:30,050|根据魔术表演法则|Well, according to magic bylaws,|
|177|00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,940|有无执照魔术师在场时|I can't disclose the secret|
|178|00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,350|我不能泄露表演秘密|in the presence of a non-licensed magician.|
|179|00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,400|没问题  我可以去外面|Not a problem. I can just step outside.|
|180|00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,450|胡说|Nonsense!|
|181|00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:41,370|我们早有准备|We prepare for such things.|
|182|00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,800|五感剥夺头盔|The old sensory-deprivation helmet.|
|183|00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,830|我一戴上这玩意儿|Oh! ‭I put that baby on,|
|184|00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,940|就感觉好像我没有室友似的|it's almost like I don't have roommates.|
|185|00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,850|没错  我...我说过了  可以去外...|Yeah, I, like I said, could just step out--|

|191|00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,480|要不是你几年前|I wouldn't have this life|
|192|00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,260|推掉了伊斯塔帕游艇上的魔术演出|if you hadn't turned down the magician gig|
|193|00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,100|我根本不可能过上现在的生活|on that Ixtapa cruise years ago.|
|194|00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,170|什么  从来没人找我啊|What? I-I was never offered that job.|
|195|00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,990|是啊  他们说给你打电话  但是都没人接|Yeah, they said they called you and never heard back,|
|196|00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,770|所以他们就来找我了|so they moved on to me.|
|197|00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,570|我根本没接到那电话啊|I never got that call!|
|198|00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,210|我不能呼吸了  我不能呼吸了|I couldn't breathe! I couldn't breathe!|
|199|00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,810|你忘开通风口了|Well, you forgot to turn on the ventilator.|

|201|00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,300|不|No.|
|202|00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,770|这本该是我的工作|This was supposed to be my job.|
|203|00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,990|我看起来好蠢|I look stupid.|
|204|00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,070|你看到你妈心情有多差了吧|Hey, you see what a bad mood your mother's in?|
|205|00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,430|那是因为她想念曼尼|That's because she misses Manny.|
|206|00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,360|今天  你就是曼尼|Today, you're Manny.|
|207|00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,080|那她不就会想乔吗|But wouldn't she miss Joe then?|
|208|00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,040|别想多了|Don't overthink.|
|209|00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,160|赶紧进去  装着心里难受|Just go in there, act all heartsick,|
|210|00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,140|告诉她你想喝下午茶|and tell her you want to have high tea.|
|211|00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:43,380|妈  为什么女孩都是迷啊|Hey, Mom. Why are girls such a mystery?|
|212|00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,720|来个司康饼吧|Have a scone!|
|213|00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,310|出去  我根本见不得那个|Get out of here. I cannot even look at that.|
|214|00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,120|要命|Yikes!|
|215|00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,460|没关系  没事|Shake it off. That's okay.|
|216|00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,680|第一次尝试已经不错啦|That's a good first try.|

|220|00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,130|我知道  我也感觉到了|I know. It snuck up on me, too.|
|221|00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,890|但请记住  放弃也是生命的自然过程|But remember, letting go is a natural part of life.|
|222|00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,180|不是  杰  那样一点也不好|No. It's terrible, Jay.|
|223|00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,910|让乔送司康饼进来就更糟了|And sending Joe in here with scones made it worse!|
|224|00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,300|安静点  弗汉希欧|Silencio, Fulgencio!|

|232|00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,720|那我就解析一下这个绝妙计划吧|So, uh, just to break down this "foolproof" plan,|
|233|00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,360|你以为这样我就会嫉妒|you thought this would make me so jealous|
|234|00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,580|然后我就会求你让我参演  是吧|that I'd beg to be back in the act, didn't you?|
|235|00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,490|不  我就是发现了与我超合拍的小天才|Um, no. I just found a younger talent that I clicked with.|

|248|00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,890|这表演对我可有可无  但在过去的10年里|I don't need this, but over the last 10 years,|
|249|00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,120|我一直看着你在他们面前胆怯|I've watch you shrink in their presence.|
|250|00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,780|你很喜欢唱歌呀|And you love to sing.|
|251|00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,990|就还好吧|I like it fine.|

|278|00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,680|谁让她当初不让我回家|Well, then maybe she shouldn't have banished me from the house.|
|279|00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,080|我可能不小心让你相信|I may have accidently led you to believe|
|280|00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,800|她也有份做这个决定|that she was part of that decision,|
|281|00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,550|-但实际上...  -我就知道|- when actually -- ‭- I knew it!|

|286|00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,270|因为你  我冷落了我妈一周|So, I've been icing my mother for a week because of you?|
|287|00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,770|她肯定觉得我是最差的儿子|She must think I'm the worst son.|
|288|00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,340|那就回家让她开心|Then come home and make her day.|
|289|00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,280|我才不会丢下这些  回家救你一命呢|I'm not dropping everything to come home and bail you out.|
|290|00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,870|或许明天可以  而且我要告诉她|Tomorrow, maybe -- and I'm telling her|
|291|00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,720|-你是我不回去的原因  -等下等下|- you're the reason I haven't been around. - Hold on. Hold on.|
|292|00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,640|她通过我知道这件事比较好|It's better if she hears it from me.|
|293|00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,060|我得变个说法|I just have to spin it|
|294|00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,240|说成我这么做是为你好就行了|as if it's something I did in your best interest.|
|295|00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,410|而我还得支持你的鬼话|And I'm supposed to back that up|
|296|00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,150|装出一副这样对我更好的样子...|like I'm somehow better off because --|
|297|00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,480|你去哪呢  熊宝宝|Where'd you go, baby bear?|

|302|00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,660|克莱尔  问你个小问题|Hey, Claire. Quick question.|
|303|00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,910|我看到你只安排了米奇和我唱一首歌|I see that you only have Mitch and I down for one song.|
|304|00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,530|这不够讲一个完整的故事|Which isn't enough time to tell a story.|
|305|00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:14,690|我们愿意把歌单缩减到六首歌|So we would be willing to cut our set list to six songs.|
|306|00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,780|好  那就一首吧|Cool. So we'll keep it at one?|
|307|00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,320|好吧  那五首短的呢|Okay, so five quick songs, then?|
|308|00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,580|-一首  -这样吧  你现在答应|- One song. ‭- Yeah, I would be willing|
|309|00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,700|我就同意只表演三首歌|to close this right now at three songs.|
|310|00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,600|一首短的|One quick song,|
|311|00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,330|如果你企图开始介绍乐队成员|and if you so much as begin to introduce the band,|
|312|00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,640|我就切断电源|I'll cut the power off.|
|313|00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,130|你怎么能用这个态度和表演者说话|Okay, that is not the way you talk to talent.|
|314|00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,140|歌洛莉亚|Gloria?|
|315|00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,460|我在卫生间  进来吧|I'm in the bathroom! Come in!|

|320|00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,980|裙子在那边的防尘袋里|The dress is in that bag over there.|
|321|00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,730|太好了  我会藏到时间机器的夹层里的|Oh, great. I'll hide it in the back of the time machine.|
|322|00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:49,740|你...|You, uh...|
|323|00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,410|你这是在为摔跤比赛做准备吗|You got a big wrestling match coming up?|
|324|00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:53,890|我今天不太顺遂|I am having a bad day.|
|325|00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,910|我没心情唠家常|I don't feel like doing the chitchatting.|
|326|00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,310|我今天也过得不太好|Not having a great day myself.|
|327|00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,030|我十五年前错过了一通电话|Missed a phone call 15 years ago|
|328|00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,710|那本能展开我身为魔术师的第二事业|that could have launched a second career as a magician.|
|329|00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,860|我本能拥有一切|I could've had it all.|
|330|00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,290|白天是房产经纪人  晚上是魔术师|Realtor by day, magician by night.|
|331|00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,620|就像那部我没写完的摇滚歌剧的主人公一样|Just like the hero of that rock opera I never finished.|
|332|00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,800|菲尔  我说了我没心情唠家常|Phil, this feels like the chitchatting.|
|333|00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,700|我或许该走了|Well, I should probably get going.|
|334|00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,860|这些蒸汽会让我的西装起皱|The steam's starting to pucker up my suit.|
|335|00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,300|做完了|Done.|
|336|00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,040|我参加你婚礼时穿的就是这身西装|It's the same suit I wore to your wedding.|
|337|00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,520|真不敢相信变得这么宽松了|Can't believe how loose it's gotten.|
|338|00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,800|我很荣幸地向大家介绍|And now it is my pleasure to bring up|
|339|00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,260|我们的第一对特别演出嘉宾|the first of our very special entertainers.|

|454|00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,620|连我出席婚礼该穿什么|I couldn't even make an outfit choice for the wedding|
|455|00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,480|你妈妈都要指手画脚|without your mother commenting on it.|

|461|00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,030|是我让他别转告你留言的|I'm the one who told him not to give you the message.|
|462|00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,290|是我没听见"请看"吗|‭Did I miss the "Ta-da"?|

|473|00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,610|不是为了你|Not because of you.|
|474|00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,100|想到我妈妈需要我|I couldn't enjoy my time with Denise|
|475|00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,490|我也没办法好好享受跟丹尼丝共处的时光|knowing my mother needed me.|
|476|00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:51,090|我有稍微享受到一点啦|I mean, I enjoyed it a little.|
|477|00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,630|她是个想用热情取代暴食的舞蹈专业妹子|She's a dance major trying to replace food with affection.|
|478|00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,670|我真的无所谓|I really don't care.|
|479|00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,870|歌洛莉亚|Gloria!|

|481|00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,390|我来了|I'm here!|
|482|00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,350|好吧|Okay.|
|483|00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,400|本来还以为会有大一点的反应呢|I was kind of expecting a bigger reaction.|
|484|00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,750|我也以为曼尼来了就能让你负担一轻呢|Yeah, I thought for sure Manny being here would tip the scales.|
|485|00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:09,200|我才不用谁让我一轻|No! I don't need anyone to do that for me!|
|486|00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,040|别来烦我|Just leave me alone.|
|487|00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,970|你们俩又在玩什么变态把戏了|What kind of sick game are you two playing?|
|488|00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,840|你们到底懂没懂我来这里是放弃了什么啊|Do you have any idea what I gave up to be here?|
|489|00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,440|歌洛莉亚  你到底怎么了|What's going on with you, Gloria?|
|490|00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,430|人家现在穿不下这婚纱了|This dress doesn't fit me anymore!|
|491|00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,480|就因为这个吗|That's it?!|
|492|00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,060|我大老远去曼尼宿舍只是白费功夫吗|I drove all the way to Manny's dorm for nothing?|
|493|00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,080|对对对  你今天牺牲最大了|Oh, because you've made the sacrifice today.|
|494|00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,610|你不懂啦|You don't understand.|
|495|00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:31,500|我总跟别人说我很努力|I tell people that I work hard|
|496|00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,710|来保持体态与保持年轻|to stay fit and to stay young,|
|497|00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:37,200|但事实上我几乎没下过什么功夫|but the reality is that I barely do anything.|
|498|00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,480|但现在人家的身体越来越...|But now my body is getting...|
|499|00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,480|胖了吗|Bigger?|
|500|00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,700|你好大的胆子|How dare you!|
|501|00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,690|不过是啦|But yes.|
|502|00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,720|但我一直拥有某种外形体态|But I've always looked a certain way.|
|503|00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,800|现在我走形  那我还是什么|And now that I don't, then what am I?|
|504|00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:56,540|就只是一个有辣酱生意的自学美发师|Just a self-trained hairdresser with a hot-sauce business.|
|505|00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,650|那生意还在啊|You still have that?|
|506|00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:02,380|歌洛莉亚  你绝不只是你的外表那么简单|Gloria, you're so much more than how you look.|
|507|00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,910|这种话是说来给|That's what you say to people|
|508|00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,930|人老珠黄的女人听的|that are not that pretty anymore.|
|509|00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,180|你是不是傻啦|Are you insane?|
|510|00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:10,040|你就算是我这个年纪而且再重14公斤|You could be my age and 30 pounds heavier,|
|511|00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,770|对我来说也还是不可高攀的尤物|and you would still be unbelievably out of my league.|
|512|00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:16,130|听我说  你重了一点  那又怎么样啊|Listen, you gain a couple -- who cares?|
|513|00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,170|过去十年是我人生最美好的一段日子|These have been the best 10 years of my life.|
|514|00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:21,470|而每一斤肉  每一条皱纹|I'm in it for every pound, every wrinkle,|
|515|00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,670|每一根白发都有我的影子|every gray hair.|
|516|00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:35,760|要不要这样|Come on!|
|517|00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,520|走  上车|Let's go. Get in the car.|
|518|00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,520|-我们要去哪里  -这就不用你担心了|- Where are we going? - Don't worry about it.|
|519|00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,230|也是  我何须现在开始自己做决定呢|Oh. Why should I start making my own decisions now?|
|520|00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,040|没告诉你那份工作  我很抱歉|I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the job.|
|521|00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,730|但你就是那种"有梦就追"的人|You're just such a "go for it" kind of guy --|
|522|00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,570|我也很爱你这点|and I love that about you --|
|523|00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,650|但当时  我们有三个嗷嗷待哺的孩子|but in that case, we had three little kids,|
|524|00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,630|有房贷要付  我心里慌嘛|a mortgage, and I was nervous.|
|525|00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,100|但好歹你做决定时可以带上我吧|You could have at least included me in the decision.|
|526|00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,710|你说得对  你说得没错|You're right! You're right.|
|527|00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:05,190|我也知道一句"我很抱歉"并没有用|And I know "I'm sorry" doesn't begin to cover it.|
|528|00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,150|为什么停下了|Why are we stopping?|
|529|00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,550|我们的孩子都长大了|Well, our kids are grown,|
|530|00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,880|我经营一家公司  你白天工作也很棒|I run a company, you've got a great day job.|
|531|00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,770|我觉得或许是时候让你重拾往日爱好了|I thought maybe it was time you picked up an old hobby.|
|532|00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,390|那是...|Are those -- Uh...|
|533|00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,210|你的新魔术用品店钥匙|Keys to your new magic shop.|
|534|00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,250|我的老天啊|Oh, my God!|
|535|00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,440|去吧|Go on!|
|536|00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,640|-不是吧  -没错|- What?! - ‭I know!|
|537|00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,120|飙眼先生十分乐意地以接近白送价格转让|And Mister Ekshun was willing to let it go for next to nothing.|
|538|00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,750|现在我仔细想想|Which, now that I think of it,|
|539|00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,840|这好像不是个好兆头|is probably not a great sign.|
|540|00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,530|这也太赞了|This is awesome!|
|541|00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,540|"表演[飙眼]先生"的哏  我现在才发现啊|And "Mister Ekshun" -- I just got that!|
|542|00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,360|其实挺好笑的  你用来补偿|It's kind of funny that you're making up|
|543|00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,960|私自替我做决定的方法|for making a decision that should have been mine|
|544|00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:42,130|就是私自替我做了另一个决定|by making another decision for me.|
|545|00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,370|你是想要还是不想要|Do you want it or not?|
|546|00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,990|-我爱你  -我也爱你|- I love you. ‭- I love you.|
|547|00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,090|法则规定|Bylaws.|
