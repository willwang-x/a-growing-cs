|342|我们今晚就逃之夭夭 ||We escape tonight. 
|343|嘿 ||Hey. 
|344|我告诉过你离她远点  小子 ||I've told you to stay away from her, boy. 
|345|我说过你可以休息了吗 ||Did I say you could take a break? 
|346|把卡帕清理干净 ||Clean out the Kappa.

|350|马德里图斯 ||a Maledictus! 
|351|曾经被困在印度尼西亚的丛林里 她是一个血液诅咒的携带者 ||Once trapped in the jungles of Indonesia, she is the carrier of a blood curse. 
|353|这样的存在是注定 一生都要背负着这种诅咒的 ||Such Under-beings are destined, through the course of their lives... 
|354|注定会永远变成一个怪兽 ||to turn permanently into beasts. 
|355|现在他看起来很漂亮 对吗 ||But look at her. So beautiful, yes? 
|356|太令人向往了 ||So desirable. 
|357|但很快她就会永远被困在一个完全不同的身体里 ||But soon she will be trapped forever in a very different body.

|370|我这所有的怪物都认为他们能回家 ||All my freaks think they can go home. 
|371|好吧  我们走 ||Okay, let's go.

|379|我是我家族里纯种血统的最后一个男性 ||I am the last male of my pure-blooded line. 
|380|所以  如果谣言是对的  那么他也是 ||And so, if the rumors are correct, is he. 
|381|你读过第谷·多多斯的预言吗 ||Have you read The Predictions of Tycho Dodonus? 
|382|是啊  但那是诗  不是证据 ||Yeah. But that's poetry, not proof. 
|383|如果我能给你看些更好的 更具体的  能证明他是谁的东西 欧洲和美国的部会让他活着吗 ||If I could show you something better more concrete, something that proves who he is would the Ministries of Europe and America let him live? 
|386|可能吧 ||They might.

|396|-我们为什么不抓住他然后离开   -他必须要自愿的来找我 ||- Why don't we grab him and leave! - He must come to me freely... 
|397|他会的 ||and he will.

|419|如果我见到她  你觉得我该对她说什么 ||What do you think I should say to her, if I see her? 
|420|哦  好吧  最好还是不要提前想好 ||Oh, well, it's best not to plan these things.

|694|你爱她吗 ||Did you love her? 
|695|我对她的关心不够多 ||Not as well as I should have done. 
|696|释怀什么时候也不晚 ||Never too late to free yourself. 
|697|我听说忏悔是一种解脱  能如释重负 ||Confession is a relief, I'm told. A great weight lifted. 
|698|后悔是我永远的伴侣 ||Regret is my constant companion. 
|699|别让它占据了你 ||Do not let it become yours.

|703|你知道的  她会疯狂敲门找我的 ||you know, banging on all the doors and things... 
|704|所以我想  我最好还是告辞吧 ||so I think I'd better be going. 
|705|但你还没见过这里的男主人呢 ||But you haven't met your host.

|731|你会没事的 ||You're all right. Relaxio. 
|732|好吧 ||Okay. 
|733|用了白藓 它的反应还不错 ||She's responded well to the Dittany.

|735|我觉得它只是缺乏自信 斯卡曼德先生  你的箱子里有什么能让他起死回生的东西吗 ||I think she's just lacking in confidence Mr. Scamander, have you got anything in your case that might help revive this man? 
|737|我需要问他一些问题 ||I need to question him.

|739|他手上的伤疤表明他的誓言牢不可破 ||The scars on his hand suggest an unbreakable vow... 
|740|-牢不可破的誓言   -牢不可破的誓言  我也注意到了 ||- an unbreakable vow. - Unbreakable vow. I noticed that too.

|743|在下水道里一定有一条水龙 它们携带着这些寄生虫  你看  他们… ||There must be a water dragon in that sewer they carry these parasites, you see. They... 
|745|-雅各布   -干嘛 ||- Jacob? - Yeah? 
|746|在我箱子的那个口袋里  你会找到一把镊子 ||In my case, in the pocket there, you'll find a pair of tweezers.

|748|-它们又薄又尖  -又薄又尖的东西 ||- They're thin and pointy... - Thin, little pointy things. 
|749|是的  我知道镊子是什么 ||Yes, I know what tweezers are. 
|750|你可能不想看这个场景 ||You might not want to watch this... 
|751|没事的 ||I can handle it. 
|752|来吧 ||Come on.

|754|哦  别这样 ||Oh come on. 
|755|雅各布  你能帮我拿一下吗 ||Jacob, will you take that for me? 
|756|挺像章鱼的 ||Calamari.. 
|757|我必须杀了他 ||I must kill him. 
|758|谁 ||Who? 
|759|克雷登斯 ||Credence? 
|760|他可能需要几个小时才能康复  寄生虫的毒性很强 ||It may take him a few hours to recover. The parasite's poison is quite strong. 
|761|我要带着我所有发现的东西回魔法部去 ||I'll have to go back to the Ministry with what I've got. 
|762|很高兴再次见到你  斯卡曼德先生 ||It was nice to see you again, Mr. Scamander.

|766|没说  她就是这么走了  我不知道.. ||No, she just ran. I don't know... 
|767|所以你就去追她啊 ||So you chase after her! 
|768|蒂娜  拜托  听我说 斯卡曼德先生  我要去和魔法部的人谈谈 ||Tina. Please, just listen to me- Mr. Scamander, I need to go talk to the Ministry. 
|770|我知道你对傲罗的态度 ||And I know how you feel about Aurors. 
|771|我在信中表达自己的方式可能有点强硬 ||I may have been a little strong in the way that I expressed myself in that letters. 
|772|那个的短语是怎么说来着   一群装腔作势的伪君子 ||What was the exact phrase? “A bunch of careerist hypocrites? 
|773|我很抱歉  但我不喜欢别人 他们害怕或误解的一切问题的答案就是扼杀它 ||I'm sorry, but I can't admire people whose answer to everything that they fear or misunderstand is kill it? 
|775|我是个傲罗  我不是那样的人 ||I'm an Auror and I don't... 
|776|那是因为你是中间的那个头 ||Yes, and that's because you've gone middle head! 
|777|你说什么 ||Excuse me? 
|778|这是一个来自一个三个头的如尼纹蛇说法 ||It's an expression derived from the three heads of the Runespoor. 
|779|中间那个代表幻想者 ||The middle one is a visionary. 
|780|除了你  欧洲的每一个傲罗都希望克雷登斯死掉  你现在就是中间那个头 ||Every Auror in Europe wants Credence dead-except you. You've gone middle head. 
|781|现在谁会用这个词呢  斯卡曼德先生 ||Who else uses that expression, Mr. Scamander? 
|782|我想可能只有我吧 ||I think it might just be me. 
|783|是格林德沃  他在召唤追随者 ||It's Grindelwald. He's calling his followers. 
|784|太迟了 ||It's too late. 
|785|格林德沃来找克雷登斯了 ||Grindelwald's come for Credence.

|787|现在还不算太晚  我们还是可以先找到他的 ||It's not too late. We can still get to him first. 
|788|你要去哪里 ||Where are you going?

|790|那是克雷登斯最不愿意去的地方 ||That's the last place Credence would go! 
|791|在蒂娜部门藏着一个盒子 ||There's a box hidden at the Ministry Tina. 
|792|这是一个可以告诉我们克雷登斯是谁的盒子 ||It's a box that can tell us who Credence really is.
