|23|看啊  量子涨落 {\an8}量子涨落 通往过去的魔法大门 有些人称之为"时间机器" 你们该"哇"了 -不要  谢谢  -继续吧 ||Behold the Quantum Flux -- 是在空间任意位置对于能量的暂时变化 a magic portal to the past, what some might call a "Time machine." This is where you guys go "Oooh." - No, thank you. - Just get on with it. 
|29|是的  "哇" ||"Ooh," Indeed. 
|30|我在办爸爸和歌洛莉亚的结婚十周年纪念派对 而菲尔是部分娱乐项目 ||I'm throwing Dad and Gloria's 10th anniversary party, and Phil is part of the entertainment. 
|32|我要让歌洛莉亚在众人面前消失 然后令人惊奇地穿越到过去 最后穿着婚纱重新出现 ||I'm gonna make Gloria seemingly dematerialize, then wondrously travel back through time, and then rematerialize in her wedding dress. 
|35|她要在箱子里换衣服 ||She's gonna change her clothes in a box. 
|36|所以我对你在台上介绍我这事很紧张 ||This is why I'm nervous about you introducing me. 
|37|我开玩笑的  你会表现得很棒的 ||I'm kidding! You're gonna be great. 
|38|他最好发挥出色 ||He better be great. 
|39|我希望爸爸和歌洛莉亚的派对十分完美 ||I want Dad and Gloria's party to be perfect. 
|40|当年我在婚礼上还挺讨人厌的 ||I was kind of a pill at their wedding. 
|41|我那时候还没完全接受歌洛莉亚 ||I hadn't fully accepted Gloria yet. 
|42|而且我觉得我亲妈会如此下场我有一点责任 ||And I feel a little responsible for what happened with my mom. 
|43|我在婚宴上灌了她三杯 ||I fed her, like, three drinks at the reception. 
|44|想缓和一下气氛嘛 ||You know, just to take the edge off. 
|45|我是歌洛莉亚  吻我  快吻我 ||I'm Gloria! Kiss me! Oh, hey, kiss me! 
|46|不  天啊 ||No, no! Oh, geez! 
|47|妈妈 ||Mom! Mom! 
|48|她差点就把门框都扯掉了 ||She almost took the doorframe off. 
|49|她进入了虫洞 ||Into the wormhole she goes. 
|50|时钟倒转 日历重新一页页恢复 看呀 ||Clocks turn backwards, calendar pages re-attach themselves, and behold! 
|53|美丽的新娘 ||The beautiful bride! 
|54|各位  你们不觉得激动吗 ||Guys! This isn't exciting to you? 
|55|用一下想象力啊 ||Use your imaginations. 
|56|脑补到时候是我站在穿着新娘服的 歌洛莉亚旁边 ||Picture me standing next to Gloria in a wedding dress. 
|58|就这样吧 ||We're done. 
|59|米奇尔  你取蛋糕了吗 ||Mitchell, did you get the cake? 
|60|嗯  我都搞定了 ||Yeah, yeah. I got everything. 
|61|好  我得在爸爸家跟你碰头 ||Okay, good. I'll have to meet you at Dad's. 
|62|我得跟菲尔一起去取魔法箱子 ||I need to go with Phil to pick up his magic box. 
|63|你跟菲尔说了 别跟小卡提变魔术的事  对吧 ||Oh, and, hey, you told Phil not to mention the trick to Cam, right? 
|65|如果小卡发现了  他会想让 我俩也表演一番的 ||If Cam finds out, he's just gonna want us to do some kind of performance, too. 
|67|我蛮确定跟他说了别告诉小卡 ||Pretty sure I told him not to say anything. 
|68|我蛮确定你没跟他说 ||Yeah, pretty sure you didn't. 
|69|这是要干嘛 ||So, uh, what's all this? 
|70|这是补偿 ||This is redemption. 
|71|给我个直接的答案就好 ||Maybe just a straight answer. 
|72|那年是2007年 杰和歌洛莉亚的婚宴 ||The year was 2007 -- the wedding reception of Jay and Gloria. 
|74|我们送新婚夫妇的礼物是二重唱 -《溪中小岛》  -《溪中小岛》 没送成这份礼物  因为 ||Our gift to the newlyweds was a duet performance - of "Islands in the Stream." - "Islands in the Stream." A gift that would never be, because... 
|77|我记得 ||I remember. 
|78|我在婚宴上灌了我妈妈几杯 ||I fed my mom a few drinks at the reception. 
|79|我真的不想唱歌  所以我想 如果我把她灌醉  我就没必要表演了 因为我得握着她的手 ||I really did not want to sing, so I figured if I got her a little tipsy, I wouldn't have to perform because I'd have to hold her hand... 
|82|不  天啊 ||No, no, no! Oh, geez! 
|83|妈妈 ||Mom, Mom! 
|84|之后挽着她的头发让她吐 ||...and later hold her hair back. 
|85|你家人想象了十年  如果表演了会怎样 今天  他们将得知答案 ||Well, your family has wondered for 10 years "What if?" Today, they find out what for. 
|87|我不确定  小卡 ||Mm, I don't know, Cam. 
|88|我有些生疏了 在帐篷里音响效果也不好 ||I'm a little rusty, and acoustics are never good inside a tent. 
|90|还有  这场派对的重点不是我们 ||And -- Oh! This party isn't about us. 
|91|会有许多表演者 ||There's a whole slate of performers. 
|92|歌洛莉亚要在箱子里换衣服 ||Gloria's changing in a box. 
|93|这让我们的歌曲串烧更受欢迎了 ||Which makes our medley all the more welcome. 
|94|现在成了歌曲串烧吗  不 ||It's a medley now? No! No. 
|95|我今天绝对不可能以任何形态 或者形式在我挑剔的家人面前表演 ||In no way, shape, or form am I performing today in front of my judgmental family. 
|97|好吧  我们就这么去派对吧 ||Fine. We'll just... go to the party. 
|98|谢谢 ||Thank you. 
|99|-不要歌曲串烧  -没错 ||- No medley. ‭- Exactly. 
|100|等等  这不是什么陷阱吧 就三首没联系的歌曲 ||Wait. This isn't a trick -- Just three un-related songs. 
|102|你刚同意了  彩排现在开始 ||You just agreed. Rehearsal starts right now. 
|103|准备好了就加入 ||Jump in when you're ready. 
|104|为什么是你在做饭 ||Why are you cooking? 
|105|妈妈有允许你待在这吗 ||Are you allowed back there? 
|106|这是我们的结婚纪念日   我不能为你妈妈做点好事吗 ||It's our anniversary.  Can't I do something nice for your mother? 
|108|也许吧 ||Maybe. 
|109|早安  美女 ||Morning, beautiful. 
|110|早餐有西式的煎鸡蛋  辣香肠  玉米薄饼 ||We have huevos, we have chorizo, we have tortilla. 
|111|唯一缺的只有曼尼 ||What we ain't got is Manny. 
|112|很遗憾  他今天不会出席派对 ||Unfortunately, he's gonna be a no-show at the party today. 
|113|我有何能为你做的 ||What can I get you? 
|114|把这些垃圾从我身边拿开 ||Take that garbage away from me. 
|115|我要去散步 ||I'm going for a walk. 
|116|曼尼是我们婚礼的一大亮点 ||Manny was a big part of our wedding. 
|117|他牵着歌洛莉亚走上通道  还表演书法 ||He walked Gloria down the aisle, did the calligraphy. 
|118|我知道他不参加我们的周年派对 会让歌洛莉亚心情很不好 ||And I knew him not showing up to our anniversary party would put Gloria in a bad mood. 
|120|某种程度来说  我觉得自己有责任 ||In some ways, I feel responsible. 
|121|你又回来了吗 ||You're home again? 
|122|你都上大学了 ||You're in college. 
|123|你不能每周末都回家啊 ||You can't come back every weekend! 
|124|-都不拥抱一下吗  -我爱你 但是你老待在这里  就不能最大程度地 体验到大学生活了 ||-So no hug? ‭-  I love you, but you're not making the most of your college experience by being here all the time. 
|127|我大一时  我父亲送我去学校 我一直到来年春天才再见到他 ||My father dropped me off my freshman year, and I didn't see him again till the spring. 
|129|-想知道为什么吗  -我不知道 ||- You want to know why? - I don't know. 
|130|跟姑娘和打架有关吗 ||Something about dames and fistfights? 
|131|没错  我忙于交朋友 泡妞之类的事情 ||Exactly -- too busy making friends, chasing skirts, and things of that nature. 
|133|但你母亲和我认为  总待在家里 对你没好处 ||But your mother and I think it's bad for you to be here all the time. 
|135|所以赶紧走吧 我们感恩节再见 ||So hit the road, and we'll see you at Thanksgiving. 
|137|等等  我被禁止进入自己的房子了吗 ||Wait. I'm banned from my house? 
|138|别这样想 ||Don't think of it that way. 
|139|你是被禁止进入我的房子 ||You're banned from my house. 
|140|严格说来  歌洛莉亚没参与这一决定 意思就是 ||Technically, Gloria was not in on this decision, in the sense that... 
|142|她不知道这个决定 ||she was not in on this decision. 
|143|我有点在闹脾气 ||I was a little grumpy. 
|144|我同意在派对上跟菲尔一起 表演这个魔术 ||I had agreed to do this magic trick at the party with Phil. 
|146|我要进入一个箱子里 然后穿着我的婚纱出来 ||I go into a box, and then I come out in my wedding dress. 
|148|但是有个问题 ||But there was a problem. 
|149|拉 ||Pull! 
|150|拉不动啊 ||She won't budge! 
|151|唯一合理的解释就是 有人溜进了我的衣柜 把我的婚纱缩小了 ||The only logical explanation is that somebody snuck into my closet and shrunk my wedding dress. 
|154|比如我妹妹 ||Like, probably my sister. 
|155|所以过去这周 我在努力减肥 要比我结婚时还要瘦 ||So for the past week, I've had to, like, get even skinnier than I was at my wedding. 
|158|你闭嘴 ||Oh, shut up. 
|160|别丢人 ||Be cool. 
|161|菲尔  这是魔术商店 ||Phil, it's a magic shop. 
|162|我是来过这店里最不丢人的那个人了 ||I'm the coolest person that's ever been in here. 
|163|他怎么做到的 ||How does he do it? 
|164|我开玩笑的  我知道他怎么弄的 ||I'm kidding. I know how he does it. 
|165|克莱尔  这位就是传奇的飙眼先生 ||Claire, meet the legendary Mister Ekshun. 
|166|你好 ||Hello. 
|167|你耳朵后面是什么 ||And what's this behind your ear? 
|168|毛衣掉毛了而已 ||Oh, just some sweater fluff. 
|169|这地方太棒了 ||Well, the place looks great. 
|170|你能想象天天来这里吗 ||Can you imagine coming here every day? 
|171|真希望是每天都来 ||I wish it was every day. 
|172|我现在那么多巡演要去 越来越没时间打理幻想殿堂了 ||I have less and less time for the old Illusionatorium, with all the road jobs I still book. 
|174|你可以快速再给我过一遍 量子涨落魔术吗 ||Would you mind quickly walking me through the Quantum Flux Illusion? 
|176|根据魔术表演法则 有无执照魔术师在场时 我不能泄露表演秘密 ||Well, according to magic bylaws, I can't disclose the secret in the presence of a non-licensed magician. 
|179|没问题  我可以去外面 ||Not a problem. I can just step outside. 
|180|胡说 ||Nonsense! 
|181|我们早有准备 ||We prepare for such things. 
|182|五感剥夺头盔 ||The old sensory-deprivation helmet. 
|183|我一戴上这玩意儿 就感觉好像我没有室友似的 ||Oh! ‭I put that baby on, it's almost like I don't have roommates. 
|185|没错  我...我说过了  可以去外... 去外面就可以 ||Yeah, I, like I said, could just step out-- Outside would be fine. 
|187|她真可爱 ||She's lovely. 
|188|是啊  我超幸运的 ||Yeah. I'm super lucky. 
|189|太感谢你肯帮我了 ||Thank you so much for helping me with this. 
|190|你逗呢 ||Are you kidding? 
|191|要不是你几年前 推掉了伊斯塔帕游艇上的魔术演出 我根本不可能过上现在的生活 ||I wouldn't have this life if you hadn't turned down the magician gig on that Ixtapa cruise years ago. 
|194|什么  从来没人找我啊 ||What? I-I was never offered that job. 
|195|是啊  他们说给你打电话  但是都没人接 所以他们就来找我了 ||Yeah, they said they called you and never heard back, so they moved on to me. 
|197|我根本没接到那电话啊 ||I never got that call! 
|198|我不能呼吸了  我不能呼吸了 ||I couldn't breathe! I couldn't breathe! 
|199|你忘开通风口了 ||Well, you forgot to turn on the ventilator. 
|200|这工作应该是我来做吗 ||That was supposed to be my job? 
|201|不 ||No. 
|202|这本该是我的工作 ||This was supposed to be my job. 
|203|我看起来好蠢 ||I look stupid. 
|204|你看到你妈心情有多差了吧 ||Hey, you see what a bad mood your mother's in? 
|205|那是因为她想念曼尼 ||That's because she misses Manny. 
|206|今天  你就是曼尼 ||Today, you're Manny. 
|207|那她不就会想乔吗 ||But wouldn't she miss Joe then? 
|208|别想多了 ||Don't overthink. 
|209|赶紧进去  装着心里难受 告诉她你想喝下午茶 ||Just go in there, act all heartsick, and tell her you want to have high tea. 
|211|妈  为什么女孩都是迷啊 ||Hey, Mom. Why are girls such a mystery? 
|212|来个司康饼吧 ||Have a scone! 
|213|出去  我根本见不得那个 ||Get out of here. I cannot even look at that. 
|214|要命 ||Yikes! 
|215|没关系  没事 ||Shake it off. That's okay. 
|216|第一次尝试已经不错啦 ||That's a good first try. 
|217|去拿他的排笛 ||Go grab his pan flute! 
|218|我的新娘怎么样啦 ||How's my bride? 
|219|现在都这么大了 ||Ay! So big now. 
|220|我知道  我也感觉到了 ||I know. It snuck up on me, too. 
|221|但请记住  放弃也是生命的自然过程 ||But remember, letting go is a natural part of life. 
|222|不是  杰  那样一点也不好 ||No. It's terrible, Jay. 
|223|让乔送司康饼进来就更糟了 ||And sending Joe in here with scones made it worse! 
|224|安静点  弗汉希欧 ||Silencio, Fulgencio! 
|225|♪ 古老的黑魔法咒语锁困了我心 ♪ ♪ 你的古老黑魔法令我意乱情迷 ♪ 到你了  老爸 ||♪ That old black magic has me in its spell ♪ ♪ That old black magic that you weave so well ♪ Take it, Daddy! 
|229|米奇尔  你知道吗  我换了莉莉 ||Oh! Hi, Mitchell. You know what -- I def traded up with Lily. 
|230|还好你退出了 ||I'm glad you backed out. 
|231|莉莉  去让你的美妙声带休息下 ||Lily, why don't you go rest your instrument? 
|232|那我就解析一下这个绝妙计划吧 你以为这样我就会嫉妒 然后我就会求你让我参演  是吧 ||So, uh, just to break down this "foolproof" plan, you thought this would make me so jealous that I'd beg to be back in the act, didn't you? 
|235|不  我就是发现了与我超合拍的小天才 ||Um, no. I just found a younger talent that I clicked with.

|243|你知道我是绝不会带那乌鸦嗓上台的 ||You know I'm never taking the stage with that screech owl. 
|244|唱吧 ||Just sing.

|246|-对我吗  -是的 ||- For me? - ‭Yes. 
|247|你家人深深着迷我的演出好多次了 ||Your family has been entranced by my performances many times. 
|248|这表演对我可有可无  但在过去的10年里 我一直看着你在他们面前胆怯 ||I don't need this, but over the last 10 years, I've watch you shrink in their presence. 
|250|你很喜欢唱歌呀 ||And you love to sing.

|260|就一次  我想看到你在你家人面前 大展才华  让他们永远闭嘴 ||And just once, I would love to watch your talent soar in front of your family and shut them up for good. 
|262|-但如果你不想去...  -管他呢 ||- But if you don't want to -- - You know what? Screw it. 
|263|虽然我也很确定 你现在就是在拐我  但我不在乎 ||I don't even care that I'm mostly sure you're manipulating me right now. 
|265|我们表演定了 ||We're doing this. 
|266|我就知道你会回心转意  欢迎回来演出 ||I knew you'd come around. Welcome back to the act. 
|267|但这就对我有点太过了 ||Okay, now, this is a bit much for me. 
|268|那... ||So... 
|269|大胡子  你看到曼尼·迪尔加多了吗 ||Hey, Beardy. Have you seen Manny Delgado? 
|270|我想那位花花公子正忙着呢 ||I think the make-out king is a little occupied.

|272|你来这干嘛 ||What are you doing here? 
|273|我需要你来参加我们周年派对 ||I need you to come to our anniversary party. 
|274|我以为我不受欢迎[西语]呢 ||I thought I was persona non grata. 
|275|现在我就快要得手[西语]了 ||Now I'm halfway into flagrante delicto. 
|276|这个  我可不会错过 ||This, I don't miss. 
|277|你不来  你妈很伤心呢 ||Your mother is upset you're not gonna be there. 
|278|谁让她当初不让我回家 ||Well, then maybe she shouldn't have banished me from the house. 
|279|我可能不小心让你相信 她也有份做这个决定 -但实际上...  -我就知道 ||I may have accidently led you to believe that she was part of that decision, - when actually -- ‭- I knew it! 
|282|我就知道我妈不会这么对她的宝贝儿子[西语] ||I knew my mom wouldn't be that mean to her little papi. 
|283|曼尼 ||Manny? 
|284|马上  亲爱的 ||One minute, baby. 
|285|-这居然有妞喜欢  -闭嘴 ||- That's been working? - Shut up. 
|286|因为你  我冷落了我妈一周 ||So, I've been icing my mother for a week because of you? 
|287|她肯定觉得我是最差的儿子 ||She must think I'm the worst son. 
|288|那就回家让她开心 ||Then come home and make her day. 
|289|我才不会丢下这些  回家救你一命呢 ||I'm not dropping everything to come home and bail you out. 
|290|或许明天可以  而且我要告诉她 -你是我不回去的原因  -等下等下 ||Tomorrow, maybe -- and I'm telling her - you're the reason I haven't been around. - Hold on. Hold on. 
|292|她通过我知道这件事比较好 ||It's better if she hears it from me. 
|293|我得变个说法 说成我这么做是为你好就行了 ||I just have to spin it as if it's something I did in your best interest.

|298|这就来  熊宝宝 ||Coming, baby bear. 
|299|不用谢我 ||You're welcome. 
|300|但怎么两个人都叫熊宝宝 ||But two baby bears? 
|301|我还是新手 ||I'm new at this. 
|302|克莱尔  问你个小问题 ||Hey, Claire. Quick question. 
|303|我看到你只安排了米奇和我唱一首歌 ||I see that you only have Mitch and I down for one song. 
|304|这不够讲一个完整的故事 ||Which isn't enough time to tell a story. 
|305|我们愿意把歌单缩减到六首歌 ||So we would be willing to cut our set list to six songs. 
|306|好  那就一首吧 ||Cool. So we'll keep it at one? 
|307|好吧  那五首短的呢 ||Okay, so five quick songs, then? 
|308|-一首  -这样吧  你现在答应 我就同意只表演三首歌 ||- One song. ‭- Yeah, I would be willing to close this right now at three songs. 
|310|一首短的 如果你企图开始介绍乐队成员 我就切断电源 ||One quick song, and if you so much as begin to introduce the band, I'll cut the power off. 
|313|你怎么能用这个态度和表演者说话 ||Okay, that is not the way you talk to talent. 
|314|歌洛莉亚 ||Gloria? 
|315|我在卫生间  进来吧 ||I'm in the bathroom! Come in! 
|316|我是菲尔 ||I-It's Phil.

|321|太好了  我会藏到时间机器的夹层里的 ||Oh, great. I'll hide it in the back of the time machine. 
|322|你... ||You, uh... 
|323|你这是在为摔跤比赛做准备吗 ||You got a big wrestling match coming up? 
|324|我今天不太顺遂 ||I am having a bad day. 
|325|我没心情唠家常 ||I don't feel like doing the chitchatting. 
|326|我今天也过得不太好 ||Not having a great day myself. 
|327|我十五年前错过了一通电话 那本能展开我身为魔术师的第二事业 ||Missed a phone call 15 years ago that could have launched a second career as a magician. 
|329|我本能拥有一切 ||I could've had it all. 
|330|白天是房产经纪人  晚上是魔术师 ||Realtor by day, magician by night. 
|331|就像那部我没写完的摇滚歌剧的主人公一样 ||Just like the hero of that rock opera I never finished. 
|332|菲尔  我说了我没心情唠家常 ||Phil, this feels like the chitchatting. 
|333|我或许该走了 ||Well, I should probably get going. 
|334|这些蒸汽会让我的西装起皱 ||The steam's starting to pucker up my suit. 
|335|做完了 ||Done. 
|336|我参加你婚礼时穿的就是这身西装 ||It's the same suit I wore to your wedding. 
|337|真不敢相信变得这么宽松了 ||Can't believe how loose it's gotten. 
|338|我很荣幸地向大家介绍 我们的第一对特别演出嘉宾 ||And now it is my pleasure to bring up the first of our very special entertainers. 
|340|他们将带来一首歌 卡梅隆和米奇尔 ||Here to perform one song, Cameron and Mitchell.

|383|虽说不是最慷慨无私的表演  但仍然... 我在我爱评头论足的家人面前完全无拘无束 而这一切都归功于你 ||Not the most generous of performances, but -- I was completely free in front of my entire judgy family, and none of that would have happened without you. 
|386|我想我听懂你的意思了 你是说有一半的掌声是属于我的 -因为我让你蜕变了  -好吧 ||Well, I think I hear what you're saying -- that half of that applause was mine - 'cause I transformed you. - Okay. 
|389|这比任何10分钟的鼓手独奏都要好 ||Well, that's better than any 10-minute drum solo. 
|390|你会告诉大家这都是我的功劳吗 ||So you'll tell everyone this was my doing? 
|391|当然了 ||Of course I will. 
|392|过来 ||Come here. 
|393|好了  到时我会把箱子转两次 你有30秒时间换上婚纱 ||Okay, I'll spin the box two times, you'll have 30 seconds to change into your wedding dress. 
|395|或者我可以换上旧睡衣 让大家知道我和杰在一起后 有多自在多舒服 ||Or I change into an old pair of pajamas to show the people how comfortable I have always been with Jay. 
|398|好啊  歌洛莉亚 ||Oh, yeah. Sure, Gloria. 
|399|不如我们把台本扔了 你想说什么就随便说好了 反正观众都觉得 演员在乱编故事了 ||Why don't we just throw the script out and you can say whatever you want, 'cause the audience already thinks the actors make it all up anyway?! 
|403|对不起 ||I'm sorry! 
|404|怎么回事 ||What's going on? 
|405|没事的  菲尔 ||It's okay, Phil. 
|406|他很难过  因为15年前 他错过了一通叫他去船上变魔术的电话 ||He's very upset because 15 years ago, he missed a phone call for a job to do boat magic. 
|408|你整个下午都在生闷气就为了这事啊 ||That's why you've been sulking all afternoon? 
|409|我的生活本来会完全不同 都怪愚蠢的命运 ||My life would be completely different if not for stupid fate! 
|411|命运 ||Fate? 
|412|我来问你个问题 ||Let me ask you something. 
|413|好好学习这宝贵的一课 ||And there's a real lesson here. 
|414|你喜欢你现在的生活吗 ||Do you like how your life turned out? 
|415|喜欢 ||Yeah, sure. 
|416|家人超棒  工作稳定  公交椅广告 ||Great family, steady work, bus benches? 
|417|你不在家时我接到了那通电话 但一直没告诉你 ||I got that call when you weren't home and never gave you the message. 
|419|什么  问号加感叹号 ||What -- question mark, exclamation point?! 
|420|你为什么要那么做 ||Why would you do something like that?! 
|421|为了救他  不让他被自己害惨 ||To save him from himself. 
|422|有时候人需要被轻推一把 才能做出正确的决定 ||People sometimes need a gentle nudge to make the right choice. 
|424|大家很幸运  因为有我担任这个角色 ||And, luckily for everyone, I'm here to do it. 
|425|不只是推了菲尔 ||And not just for Phil. 
|426|我知道你在想曼尼为什么没来 ||I know you're wondering why Manny isn't here. 
|427|-我敢打赌...  -谁准备好看魔术表演啦 ||- I b-- - ‭Who's ready for some magic? 
|428|菲尔  歌洛莉亚  该你们上场了 ||Phil, Gloria, you're up. 
|429|-老公  你还好吧  -不好 ||- Honey, you okay? - ‭Nope! 
|430|女士们先生们 科学家会告诉你们 时间旅行纯属鬼扯 ||Ladies and gentlemen, the scientists would have you believe that time travel is poppycock. 
|433|在人最好的歌洛莉亚与杰这人的大日子上 我将驳倒那些质疑的声音 将这位美丽的女子 送回她举行婚礼那一天 ||But today, on the anniversary of the wonderful Gloria and Jay, I shall confound the skeptics and transport this beautiful woman back in time to the day of her wedding. 
|437|歌洛莉亚  请入箱 ||Gloria, get in the box! 
|438|麻烦来点鼓声 ||Drumroll, please. 
|439|好赞  打鼓 ||Whoo! Yes, drums! 
|440|超棒 ||Yes! 
|441|看  她消失在虫洞里了 ||Anyway, watch as she disappears into the wormhole. 
|442|这就是我的魔术  我表演完了 ||That's my trick. I'm done. 
|443|你表演完了是什么意思  把她带回来啊 ||What do you mean, you're done? Bring her back. 
|444|我准备好了 ||Okay, I'm ready! 
|445|你让我的梦想消失了 ||You made my dream disappear. 
|446|现在你的也消失了 ||Now yours is gone. 
|447|有人吗  我想出来 ||Hola! I want to come out! 
|448|菲尔  菲尔  你在"迪迪"我的派对 ||Phil. Phil, you are Dede-ing my party. 
|449|你爸爸"迪迪"了我的人生 ||Your father Dede'd my life. 
|450|15年前那通叫我去表演的电话是他接的 但却从没转告过我 ||He's the one who got the phone call 15 years ago about the magic job and never told me. 
|452|-菲尔  -你家人一直把我当小孩对待 好像我无法自己做决定 ||- Oh, Phil. - Your family has always treated me like a child who can't make his own decisions. 
|454|连我出席婚礼该穿什么 你妈妈都要指手画脚 ||I couldn't even make an outfit choice for the wedding without your mother commenting on it. 
|456|所以我当年才偷给了她三杯酒 ||That's why I slipped her those three drinks at the reception. 
|457|这里面好热呀 ||It's very warm back here! 
|458|你必须把歌洛莉亚从箱子里放出来 ||You need to let Gloria out of that box. 
|459|还有 ||And... 
|460|那件事与我爸无关 ||my dad had nothing to do with that. 
|461|是我让他别转告你留言的 ||I'm the one who told him not to give you the message. 
|462|是我没听见"请看"吗 ||‭Did I miss the "Ta-da"? 
|463|菲尔  对不起 ||Phil, I'm so sorry. 
|464|但当时你的工作刚有起色 而孩子们都还小 ||But your business was just taking off, and the kids were really little. 
|466|不  别说了  我不想听到 ||No, no. I-I -- I don't want to hear it. 
|467|原来我老婆才是我不能有魔术事业的凶手 这我生来就为此的事业 ||My own wife is the reason I don't have a career in magic -- a thing I was born to do?! 
|469|快看我 ||Look at me! 
|470|我十年来一点都没变 ||I haven't changed in 10 years! 
|471|歌洛莉亚 ||Gloria! 
|472|你来了  太好了 ||You came! Thank God! 
|473|不是为了你 ||Not because of you. 
|474|想到我妈妈需要我 我也没办法好好享受跟丹尼丝共处的时光 ||I couldn't enjoy my time with Denise knowing my mother needed me. 
|476|我有稍微享受到一点啦 ||I mean, I enjoyed it a little. 
|477|她是个想用热情取代暴食的舞蹈专业妹子 ||She's a dance major trying to replace food with affection. 
|478|我真的无所谓 ||I really don't care. 
|479|歌洛莉亚 ||Gloria! 
|480|我有个惊喜给你 ||I have a surprise for you! 
|481|我来了 ||I'm here! 
|482|好吧 ||Okay. 
|483|本来还以为会有大一点的反应呢 ||I was kind of expecting a bigger reaction. 
|484|我也以为曼尼来了就能让你负担一轻呢 ||Yeah, I thought for sure Manny being here would tip the scales. 
|485|我才不用谁让我一轻 ||No! I don't need anyone to do that for me! 
|486|别来烦我 ||Just leave me alone. 
|487|你们俩又在玩什么变态把戏了 ||What kind of sick game are you two playing? 
|488|你们到底懂没懂我来这里是放弃了什么啊 ||Do you have any idea what I gave up to be here? 
|489|歌洛莉亚  你到底怎么了 ||What's going on with you, Gloria? 
|490|人家现在穿不下这婚纱了 ||This dress doesn't fit me anymore! 
|491|就因为这个吗 ||That's it?! 
|492|我大老远去曼尼宿舍只是白费功夫吗 ||I drove all the way to Manny's dorm for nothing? 
|493|对对对  你今天牺牲最大了 ||Oh, because you've made the sacrifice today. 
|494|你不懂啦 ||You don't understand. 
|495|我总跟别人说我很努力 来保持体态与保持年轻 但事实上我几乎没下过什么功夫 ||I tell people that I work hard to stay fit and to stay young, but the reality is that I barely do anything. 
|498|但现在人家的身体越来越... ||But now my body is getting... 
|499|胖了吗 ||Bigger? 
|500|你好大的胆子 ||How dare you! 
|501|不过是啦 ||But yes. 
|502|但我一直拥有某种外形体态 ||But I've always looked a certain way. 
|503|现在我走形  那我还是什么 ||And now that I don't, then what am I? 
|504|就只是一个有辣酱生意的自学美发师 ||Just a self-trained hairdresser with a hot-sauce business. 
|505|那生意还在啊 ||You still have that? 
|506|歌洛莉亚  你绝不只是你的外表那么简单 ||Gloria, you're so much more than how you look. 
|507|这种话是说来给 人老珠黄的女人听的 ||That's what you say to people that are not that pretty anymore. 
|509|你是不是傻啦 ||Are you insane? 
|510|你就算是我这个年纪而且再重14公斤 对我来说也还是不可高攀的尤物 ||You could be my age and 30 pounds heavier, and you would still be unbelievably out of my league. 
|512|听我说  你重了一点  那又怎么样啊 ||Listen, you gain a couple -- who cares? 
|513|过去十年是我人生最美好的一段日子 ||These have been the best 10 years of my life. 
|514|而每一斤肉  每一条皱纹 每一根白发都有我的影子 ||I'm in it for every pound, every wrinkle, every gray hair. 
|516|要不要这样 ||Come on! 
|517|走  上车 ||Let's go. Get in the car. 
|518|-我们要去哪里  -这就不用你担心了 ||- Where are we going? - Don't worry about it. 
|519|也是  我何须现在开始自己做决定呢 ||Oh. Why should I start making my own decisions now? 
|520|没告诉你那份工作  我很抱歉 ||I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the job. 
|521|但你就是那种"有梦就追"的人 我也很爱你这点 但当时  我们有三个嗷嗷待哺的孩子 有房贷要付  我心里慌嘛 ||You're just such a "go for it" kind of guy -- and I love that about you -- but in that case, we had three little kids, a mortgage, and I was nervous. 
|525|但好歹你做决定时可以带上我吧 ||You could have at least included me in the decision. 
|526|你说得对  你说得没错 ||You're right! You're right. 
|527|我也知道一句"我很抱歉"并没有用 ||And I know "I'm sorry" doesn't begin to cover it. 
|528|为什么停下了 ||Why are we stopping? 
|529|我们的孩子都长大了 我经营一家公司  你白天工作也很棒 ||Well, our kids are grown, I run a company, you've got a great day job. 
|531|我觉得或许是时候让你重拾往日爱好了 ||I thought maybe it was time you picked up an old hobby. 
|532|那是... ||Are those -- Uh... 
|533|你的新魔术用品店钥匙 ||Keys to your new magic shop. 
|534|我的老天啊 ||Oh, my God! 
|535|去吧 ||Go on! 
|536|-不是吧  -没错 ||- What?! - ‭I know! 
|537|飙眼先生十分乐意地以接近白送价格转让 ||And Mister Ekshun was willing to let it go for next to nothing. 
|538|现在我仔细想想 这好像不是个好兆头 ||Which, now that I think of it, is probably not a great sign. 
|540|这也太赞了 ||This is awesome! 
|541|"表演[飙眼]先生"的哏  我现在才发现啊 ||And "Mister Ekshun" -- I just got that! 
|542|其实挺好笑的  你用来补偿 私自替我做决定的方法 就是私自替我做了另一个决定 ||It's kind of funny that you're making up for making a decision that should have been mine by making another decision for me. 
|545|你是想要还是不想要 ||Do you want it or not? 
|546|-我爱你  -我也爱你 ||- I love you. ‭- I love you. 
|547|法则规定 ||Bylaws.
