|23|00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,170|大家都有酒了吗  我要开始感恩节祝酒了|Does everyone have a glass? I'm just giving my Thanksgiving toast.|
|24|00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,470|拜托老爸  你不觉得这样很怪吗 每年都要选一个不知为何 反正就是让你觉得格外骄傲的人|Oh, come on, Dad. Isn't it weird that  every year you single out one person  who somehow made you extra proud this year?|
|27|00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,750|这让我们其他人觉得... 是你  克莱尔|It makes the rest of us feel like we -- It's you, Claire.|
|29|00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,260|真棒  我就知道|Yeah! I knew it!|

|32|00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,170|我知道我在家庭中引发竞争 你们都对我都颇有微词 但瞧瞧结果|I know I get a hard time for stirring up competition in the family, but look at the results.|
|35|00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,970|菲尔新开了家魔术用品店|Phil scoring with his new magic shop.|
|36|00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,680|小卡带的球队赢得了重要比赛|Cam winning the big game.|
|37|00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,200|克莱尔赢了跑步比赛|Claire winning the race.|
|38|00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,500|而米奇尔吓跑了那个小偷|And Mitchell scaring away that burglar.|
|39|00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,060|你也是赢家  杰|And you are a winner, too, Jay.|

|43|00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,240|爸爸  她怎么了|Dad, what is wrong with her?|
|44|00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,190|我挑战她 一周内走十万步|I challenged her to get to 100,000 steps in a week.|
|46|00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,810|-那很容易  -真容易|- That's easy. - That's so easy.|
|47|00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:44,990|不算购物|Without shopping.|
|48|00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,450|-我明白挑战难处了  -不 她还剩1000步就获得荣誉了|- I get -- I get the challenge. - No.  She's 1,000 steps from glory.|
|50|00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:49,950|跟你们一样 她的动力来源于我吝啬赞美|Like the rest of you, she was motivated by my stingy praise.|
|52|00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,190|我环顾四周  看到的全是赢家 我感到十分骄傲|As I look around the room, I see nothing but winners, and I couldn't be prouder.|
|54|00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,080|敬我们|To us!|

|62|00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,140|我们都为米奇尔那天做的事感到骄傲|We're all so proud of Mitchell about what happened the other day.|
|63|00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,440|我的想法是我们可以...|What I was thinking was, we could...|
|64|00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:31,700|天啊|Oh, my gosh!|
|65|00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:32,830|有人闯入了吗|Was there a break-in?|
|66|00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,390|对啊对啊  简直要疯了|Yeah, yeah. It was -- It was crazy.|
|67|00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,020|我当时就冲他吼叫 我好像就把他吓跑了  所以...|I just started yelling at him, and I guess I scared him away, so...|
|69|00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,490|天啊  亲爱的  你没事吧|Oh, my gosh, sweetie. Are you okay?|

|72|00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,000|万分骄傲|So proud.|
|73|00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,640|如果小偷回来了  而勇敢二爸不在的话 -我们可以用这个  -不不|If the robber comes back when Brave Daddy isn't here, - we can use these. - Okay, no, no, no, no.|
|75|00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,760|那是我在学校没收的|I had to confiscate those at school.|
|76|00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:52,640|这很危险 而且你最好还是避开这种亚洲人爱玩的玩意|They're very dangerous, and, plus, you should avoid the cliche.|
|78|00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,060|没收违禁品是我在学校新工作的一部分|Confiscating contraband is part of my new job at school.|
|79|00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,050|我最近升职为 代理[演戏]副校长了|I was recently promoted to acting vice principal.|
|81|00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,700|这跟演戏毫无关系|Which has nothing to do with acting.|
|82|00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,350|他们非常明确地跟我说了|That was made very clear to me.|
|83|00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,000|你看起来有些紧张|Hey. Hey. Y-You seem a little nervous.|
|84|00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,470|你是在担心这场重要比赛吗|Are you -- Are you worried about the big game?|
|85|00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,030|是啊  我有些紧张|Yeah. I'm a little nervous.|
|86|00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,610|响尾蛇队过去六年里都打败了我们 而我们不能输|The Rattlesnakes have beat us the last six years, and we cannot lose.|
|88|00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,510|你这么紧张是因为他们的教练是女人吗|Is any of this because their coach is a woman?|
|89|00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,540|我们不该支持她吗  因为 因为她是另一个执教橄榄球的直女吗|I mean, shouldn't we be rooting for her, because -- Oh, what, because she's another straight person coaching football?|
|91|00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,560|-祝你好运  -谢谢你  亲爱的|- Well, good luck. - Thank you, sweetie.|
|92|00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,380|我无法保证我让你感受到的骄傲 和打跑了小偷的二爸一样多  但我会努力|You know, I can't promise that I'll make you as proud as your daddy  who fought off a burglar, but I will try.|
|94|00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,790|有传言说后援俱乐部 要把给我们的一些经费转给科学项目|You know, there's murmurs that the booster club is gonna divert some of our money to the science program.|
|96|00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,470|因为这样就能让肯尼迪们变酷 在草坪上玩科学什么的|Because that's what made the Kennedys cool, you know -- playing science on the lawn.|
|98|00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,310|第一个想出怎么把号码布一次贴到位的人 肯定能发大财|Ow! The first person who figures out how to stick these numbers  right on is gonna be rich.|
|100|00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,980|你可以在穿上背心之前先贴好啊|You could just pin it to your shirt before you put it on.|
|101|00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,350|你跟别人分享过这个点子吗|Have you shared this idea with anyone else?|
|102|00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,060|艾丽克斯小时候  我会把她放进慢跑婴儿车里 她是我的跑步伙伴|When Alex was a baby, I used to throw her in a jogging stroller, and she was my running buddy.|
|104|00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,720|这周她得知我要跑一万米时 就坚持要来|This week, when she found out I was doing a 10K, she insisted on coming.|
|106|00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:57,830|无聊死了|Snore.|
|107|00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,260|我把我妈当做我的白痴心理学论文的对象 因为我开始太晚了  没法领走猴子了|I'm using my mom as a subject for my stupid psych paper because I started too late to sign out a monkey.|
|109|00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,920|论文是关于积极与消极强化的|It's about positive versus negative reinforcement.|
|110|00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,420|比赛前半程我会喊  "你能做到的  妈" 后半程则是  "算了吧  女人" 幸好  做完实验后 给猴子买的香蕉可以给她吃|First half of the race -- "You can do it, Mom!" Second half -- "It's not your day, lady!" Thankfully, after it's done, I'll still be able to give out the banana I bought.|
|114|00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,090|多谢你照顾乔|Thank you so much for taking care of Joe.|
|115|00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,880|我还得去店里买点晚餐食材|I still have to get some things from the store for dinner.|
|116|00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,290|没问题|It's no problem.|
|117|00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,440|我有很多知识可以传授|I got a lot of knowledge to pass on.|
|118|00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,430|你有在持续练习打嗝吗|You been practicing your burping drills?|
|119|00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:24,870|是的|Yes!|
|120|00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,620|-好些了  -好  闲聊完了|- Better. - Okay, enough chitchat.|
|121|00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,540|给我促销的VIP票|Give me the V.I.P. Pass for the sale.|
|122|00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,650|大家都听说过H.布朗夫曼服装的 黑五促销  那时候大伙儿 像动物一样疯狂争抢晚礼服|Everybody's heard of the H. Bronfman Clothiers Black Friday sale where the hoi polloi fight over tuxedos like animals.|
|125|00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,460|但是在感恩节 极少数人会受邀当第一批进场的买家|But on Thanksgiving Day, a select few are invited to get first crack.|
|127|00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,600|如果我能把要的都买齐 我的燕尾服就会在小姑娘房里脱到只剩两成|If I get everything I want, that tux will be 80% off in Tammy Bosworth's dorm room.|
|129|00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,280|黑金卡|Black gold.|
|130|00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,110|这是俱乐部成员当做小费给我的 他让我弄来几瓶灰雁伏特加|I got it as a tip from some club members who had me "deal" with some geese.|
|132|00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:51,180|你休想玷污这次体验|You will not taint this experience.|
|133|00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,950|克莱尔  你为什么贴着号码布|Claire, why do you have that number?|
|134|00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,560|你参加选美比赛了吗|Are you in a pageant?|
|135|00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,160|她要跑一万米  她的表现一定会很棒|She's running a 10K. And she is going to do great.|
|136|00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:04,760|我就知道你会让我们感到骄傲|I know that you're gonna make us oh-so proud!|
|137|00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,220|显然这本该是群抱 而我的邀请函在邮寄时遗失了|Obviously, this was meant to be a group hug, and my invitation got lost in the mail. Mm.|
|139|00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,670|菲尔  你为了变魔术 订的那个疯狂电话亭 已经在我家了|Phil... that crazy phone booth that you ordered for your magic trick -- It's already at my house.|
|142|00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,680|提前两天到了吗|It's here two days early?!|
|143|00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,880|我今天就能拍摄教程|I can shoot my how-to video today!|
|144|00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,320|海莉  好戏上演了 |Haley! Showtime!|
|145|00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,920|毫无疑问  二战中 最伟大的魔术就是诺曼底电话亭|It goes without saying that the greatest trick to come out of World War II is the Normandy Phone Booth.|
|147|00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,530|多年来  它的名声时起时落|Over the years, its reputation has ebbed and flowed.|
|148|00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,470|众所周知  在1969年的 纳拉干塞特魔术节上它遭到了大家的喝倒彩|It was famously booed at the 1969 Narragansett Magic Festival.|
|150|00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,380|当然  那时候 大部分人都在抗议魔术|Of course, this is a time when most people are into protest magic.|
|152|00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:39,860|所以很自然  他们会对经典魔术嗤之以鼻  那就是一个英勇的士兵冲进电话亭 打了拯救世界的电话 而电话亭慢慢灌满了水|So naturally, they would thumb their nose at a classic trick where a heroic soldier dashes into a phone booth to make a world-saving call while it slowly fills with water!|
|156|00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,630|这多赞啊  嬉皮士们|Come on, hippies!|
|157|00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,390|天啊|God!|
|158|00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,810|小家伙  你出去玩吧|All right, buddy. Run outside and play real quick.|
|159|00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,520|我要去楼上忙些事|I'm gonna take care of something upstairs.|
|160|00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,170|我得更新我在 一款新社交媒体软件"内缝线"上的用户照片|I had to update my profile pic on this new social-media app called Inseam.|
|162|00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,510|这软件超酷的  基本还没人知道|It's super cool. No one knows about it.|
|163|00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,120|有些老家伙用它分享自制成衣 但之后两个布鲁克林DJ 开始在上面分享一些视频  然后就火了|Some old guys were using it for home tailoring, but then two Brooklyn deejays started sharing a couple of videos on it, and it blew up.|
|166|00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,190|太严肃了|Not approachable.|
|167|00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,380|太亲和了|Too approachable.|
|168|00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,730|完美|There's my guy.|
|169|00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,100|怎么了|What's up?|
|170|00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,210|伙计  我刚准备离开 结果在内缝线上看见了你的新照片|Dude, I was just about to leave, and I saw your new pic popped up on Inseam.|
|172|00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,060|你也用内缝线吗|You're on Inseam?|
|173|00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,300|是的  我已经用了一周了|Yes, I've been on it for a week.|
|174|00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:25,490|你看看照片  乔在你身后的树上|Okay, look at your picture. Joe is in a tree behind you.|
|175|00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,330|天啊  他就在那里|Oh, my God, he's right there!|
|176|00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,540|等等  乔|Hang on, Joe!|
|177|00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:32,380|喂|Hello?|
|178|00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,950|乔怎么了|What's going on with Joe?|
|179|00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,010|你也用内缝线吗|You're on Inseam?|
|180|00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,070|当然了|Of course I'm on Inseam.|
|181|00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,020|我儿子挂在树上了吗|Is my son hanging from a tree?|
|182|00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,170|真棒  你信了|Oh, that's great! You fell for it.|
|183|00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,980|我的改图技术越来越出神入化啊|I'm, uh -- I'm getting pretty good at Photoshop.|
|184|00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,330|那是假照片吗|That's a fake picture?|
|185|00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,710|是啊  我有许多张乔做危险事情的照片|Yeah, I got a bunch of Joe doing dangerous stuff.|
|186|00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,980|那你晚点给我看看  好吗|You're gonna have to show me this later, okay?|
|187|00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,010|没问题|Will do.|
|188|00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,330|都怪你 我现在满身大汗  都没办法 鉴定丝绸衬衫了|Well, thanks to you, now I'm all sweaty, and it's gonna be impossible to judge the silk shirts.|
|191|00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,170|应该宽松飘逸  而不是黏身上|They're supposed to blouse, not cling.|
|192|00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,740|能让我看看这张卡吗|Hey, can I see that card for a second?|
|193|00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,110|-你干什么  -等你把乔的头P到鳄鱼嘴里 我才会把这张卡交还给你|- What are you doing? - I'll put this card back in your hand when you Photoshop that kid's head in an alligator's mouth.|
|195|00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,500|上游河谷在二码线上 比赛时间还剩十秒|Upper Valley on the 2-yard line with 10 seconds to go.|
|197|00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,840|一个触地得分将会获胜|A touchdown will win the game.|
|198|00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,830|暂停  暂停|Okay, timeout! Timeout!|
|199|00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,450|加油  海豚队|Let's go, Dolphins!|
|200|00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,450|教练  我们怎么防守|Coach, what is our defense?|
|201|00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,970|好吧  按理说应该用奔跑达阵 但他们用传球虐我们一天了|Okay, you know what? It's a running situation, but they've been killing us with that pass all day.|
|203|00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,500|我的直觉认为他们要传球  但是... 好吧  让我想想|My gut tells me they're gonna pass, but Okay, just let me think about it.|
|205|00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,720|让开|Move. Move!|
|206|00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,190|那些蠢货 肯定会认为我们要传球  所以我们要奔跑|Those dumb bastards are going to be thinking pass, which is why we're going to run.|
|208|00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,110|左边用2包围防守|Trap Two, on the left side.|
|209|00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,310|我的副校长对讲机 不小心收听到了上游河谷教练 说出她的白痴娘们战术|My vice principal walkie-talkie accidentally picked up that Upper Valley coach calling her dumb lady play.|
|212|00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,110|我要改变我的防守策略吗|Now, was I gonna change my defense?|
|213|00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,630|只有没有骨气  全力争胜  追名逐利的人 才会选择赢  而不是展示高风亮节|Only some spineless win-at-all-costs glory hound would choose winning over showing some moral fiber.|
|215|00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:47,510|海豚队赢了  海豚队赢了|Dolphins win! Dolphins win!|
|217|00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,380|体育场里的所有人  包括我|Everybody in that stadium, including me...|
|218|00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,640|-是啊  -都以为对方会传球|- Well... - was expecting a pass.|
|219|00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,620|但你的直觉告诉你不会那样|But your instincts told you something else.|
|220|00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,840|真了不起  我的朋友|That's big-time, my friend.|
|221|00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,670|谢谢你这么说  杰  谢谢你|Well, I-I-I appreciate it, Jay. Uh, thank you.|
|222|00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,660|米奇尔|Mitchell!|
|223|00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:04,560|我是个骗子|I'm a fraud.|
|224|00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,980|那就别再和那个咖啡师吹牛 说你在百老汇做过沙威[悲惨世界]的替角|Well, then stop telling that barista that you understudied Javert on Broadway.|
|226|00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,610|他知道你叫什么  上网一查就发现了|He knows your name. He can look it up.|
|227|00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:10,860|不  我不小心在对讲机上 听到那个女教练的战术安排 然后我改了我的防守策略赢了比赛|No, I overheard the lady coach call her play on my walkie-talkie, and I changed my defense to win the game.|
|230|00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,460|现在我焦虑发作  我必须坦白|And now I'm having anxiety, and I have to confess.|
|231|00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,310|不行  你不能坦白|No, you-you are not gonna confess.|
|232|00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,290|你给我把焦虑揉成一个小球 再塞到你灵魂里那个专门用来 密封童年阴影的小洞里去|You're gonna smush that anxiety into a little ball, and you're gonna push it into that little, tiny hole in your soul where childhood traumas go.|
|235|00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,800|这里的所有人都是赢家|Everybody here is a winner.|
|236|00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,250|如果最后你成了饭桌上唯一的失败者 我仅有的收获会是所有人居高临下的同情|I-If you end up being the one loser at the table, I'm gonna get nothing but condescending pity from everybody.|
|238|00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:34,460|特别是克莱尔那副难以忍受的虚伪嘴脸|Especially Claire, that insufferable phony.|
|239|00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,670|太漂亮了|Hey, so pretty!|
|240|00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,000|-卢克  -歌洛莉亚|- Luke. - Hey, Gloria.|
|241|00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,310|你的刘海真好看|Sure love those bangs.|
|242|00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,640|为什么剪了刘海|What's the story with those?|
|243|00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,310|我知道你一直在躲着我 因为根本没有乔身处险境的合成照片|I know you have been avoiding me because there are no Photoshopped pictures of Joe in danger.|
|245|00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,990|而你这个问题的答案很简单 刘海衬我的脸|And the the answer to your question is very simple -- They frame my face.|
|247|00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,880|那些照片啊|Oh, those pictures.|
|248|00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,440|就在这|Here we are.|
|249|00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,990|乔捅蜂窝|Joe poking a bees' nest.|
|251|00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,680|乔射杀李·哈维·奥斯瓦尔德|Oh, and Joe killing Lee Harvey Oswald.|
|252|00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,090|真可爱|So cute.|
|253|00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,620|杰  卢克是个天才|Jay, Luke is a genius.|
|254|00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,060|谢了  伙计|Thanks, buddy.|
|255|00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,660|你可以去买高级衣服了|You can go do your fancy shopping now.|
|256|00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,420|太棒了  为了弥补我失去的时间 我要给脚后跟涂上油 试鞋时穿脱就快多了|Awesome. To make up for the time I lost, I'm gonna baby oil my heels so I can try on shoes faster.|
|259|00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:24,380|菲尔  你看过卢克合成的这些照片了吗|Phil, did you see this Photoshop stuff that Luke did?|
|260|00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,700|他真是个魔术师|He's a real magician.|
|261|00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,520|我想这是有其父必有其子|I guess he came by it honestly.|
|262|00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,670|这话对我来说意义非凡  杰|That means the world to me, Jay.|
|263|00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,220|我的人生是场谎言|I'm living a lie.|
|264|00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,340|克莱尔  这家里的每个人都是赢家 除了我|Claire, everyone in this family's a winner except for me.|
|266|00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,330|我变我变我变废柴|Abraka-failure.|
|267|00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,460|准备好灌水了吗|Ready to fill this thing up?|
|269|00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,060|我们之所以在这里拍 就是为了用泳池水  能重复利用|The-The whole reason we're here is to use the pool water, which is recyclable.|
|271|00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,620|我算是可持续魔术运动的大人物|I'm sort of a hero in the sustainable magic movement.|
|272|00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,040|我可不想失去三只环保绿兔的评级|I'd hate to lose my three green rabbits rating.|
|273|00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,230|好吧|Okay.|
|274|00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,530|我们这就开拍吗|Should we start filming?|
|275|00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,180|当然  好  当然|For sure. Yeah. For sure.|
|276|00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,940|我认为我或许该先休息一下|I-I-I think I'll-I'll probably just take a quick minute.|
|277|00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,860|年轻时我表演什么魔术都不害怕 任何被困在狭小空间的魔术都行 盒中狐  另一个牧羊人 爱因斯坦的鸟浴盆|As a young man, I had no fear of any trick where I was jammed into tight spaces -- Fox in a Box, The Wrong Shepherd, Einstein's Birdbath.|
|281|00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:07,190|不过最近  我多少有一点幽闭恐惧 通常我只要 给非常支持我的妻子打通电话就好了|Lately, though, I have had a touch of claustrophobia, which is usually cleared up by a quick call to my super-supportive wife.|
|284|00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,980|你终于接电话了|Oh, you finally picked up.|
|285|00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,570|不  没有紧急状况|No, no, it's not an emergency.|
|286|00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,130|我只是...你在听吗  克莱尔|I just -- Hello? Claire?|
|287|00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:18,520|等着你的指令呢  老爸|Just give me the word, Dad.|
|288|00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,150|好|Yep.|
|289|00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,670|我们|Let's...|
|290|00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,850|-我们开始吧  -好  准备好了吗|- Let's do this. - Great. Ready?|
|291|00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,740|-好了  -开拍|- Yeah. - And...action.|
|292|00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,650|您好  恭喜您购买了这个 诺曼底电话亭|Hello, and congratulations on your purchase of the Normandy Phone Booth.|
|294|00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,480|接下来我将演示 您为生活"拨动"了多少乐趣|The following will demonstrate just how much fun you've...dialed up.|
|296|00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,710|今天就是登陆日|Here we are on D-Day.|
|297|00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,460|该死的空中支援在哪|Where's the damned air support?|
|298|00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,560|太好了|Oh, good.|
|299|00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,960|有个电话亭|A p-phone booth.|
|300|00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,770|我听说纳粹们在电话亭里设置了陷阱 但我...|I hear the Nazis have booby-trapped these, but I will...|
|302|00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:57,080|我绝对会以身犯险  给盟军司令部打电话|I definitely will take the risk of calling Allied Command.|
|303|00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,010|您好  上将|Hello, General.|
|304|00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,590|是的  我们被敌人包围了|Yes, the enemy is all around us.|
|305|00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,460|火力很猛|Blast!|
|306|00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,650|这个电话亭里设置了陷阱|This is one of the phone booths that's booby-trapped.|
|307|00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:15,830|不|Oh, no!|
|308|00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,430|是的  上将  敌人正在逼近|Yes, General, the enemy is closing in!|
|309|00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,150|我们无路可逃... 海莉  快放我出去|There's no esca- Haley! Get me out of here!|
|311|00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,190|海莉是谁  我是卢瑟福护士|Who's Haley? I'm Nurse Rutherford.|
|312|00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:26,880|如果我不能表演这个魔术 我的魔术用品店会沦为小型商场的笑柄|If I can't do this trick, my magic shop is gonna be the laughingstock of the mini-mall.|
|314|00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,210|而那里还有一家过时多年的租片店呢|And there's still a Blockbuster there.|
|315|00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,220|亲爱的  我知道你最近过得不顺 但你不能告诉别人 因为我们决不能成为今年家里的失败者|Honey, I know you're going through something, but you need to keep it to yourself, because we will not be the loser family this year.|
|318|00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,780|-克莱尔  -怎么|- Claire. - Yeah?|
|319|00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,870|我想到了一个天才点子|I had a genius idea.|
|320|00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,330|你的比赛路线正好经过普利切特衣橱|Your race went right by Pritchett's Closets.|
|321|00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,520|把保全摄像调出来|Pull the security tape.|
|322|00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,820|我们用你领先的画面冲副大广告 "普利切特  三十年来一直领先于他人" -天才  -太赞了  老爸  真棒|We'll blow up a frame of you in the lead and run a big ad -- "Pritchett's. Leading the Pack for 30 Years." - Genius! - I love it, Dad! Yes!|
|325|00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,530|我这就去|I am on that!|
|326|00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,620|我们有麻烦了|We have a problem.|
|327|00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,340|是我有麻烦了|I had a problem.|
|329|00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,140|你好|H-H-Hello?|
|330|00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:02,730|你好  该死|Hello -- Damn it.|
|331|00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,560|菲尔  你最好是有紧急状况|Phil, this better be an emergency.|
|332|00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,040|你终于接电话了|Oh, you finally picked up.|
|333|00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,810|不  没有紧急状况  我只是... 我在赛跑  歌单都因为你乱套了|No, no, it's not an emergency. I just -- I'm running a race, and you just screwed up my playlist!|
|335|00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:16,990|从那一刻起 我就不在赛跑路线上了|From that point on, I was no longer on the actual race course.|
|337|00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,090|谢谢你|Thank you!|
|338|00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:24,790|谢谢|Thanks.|
|339|00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:29,700|后来可能在某个转角我又兜回到比赛路线上|I guess I hit a point where I funneled back onto the course.|
|340|00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,970|我的确注意到我的体能 似乎比我前面的几个人充沛许多 但我当时没多想|I did notice that I seemed to have more energy  than the few people in front of me, but I didn't-I didn't think much of it.|
|344|00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,480|我做到了  我赢了我赢了|I did it! I won! I won!|
|345|00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,210|你看到了吗  宝贝  我赢了|Did you see that, honey? I won!|
|346|00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,130|不  你没赢|Uh, no, you didn't.|
|347|00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,070|我一直站在五千米标志那  根本没看到你|I was standing at the 5K mark and never saw you.|
|348|00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,170|-什么  -克莱尔|- What? - Claire!|
|349|00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,630|我刚才在商店里  我看到你赢了|I was at the store, and I saw you win!|
|350|00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,120|亲爱的|Oh, honey!|
|351|00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,760|我认识她|I know her!|
|352|00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,000|她是我继女|She's my stepdaughter!|
|353|00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:56,910|普利切特衣橱的保全摄像里 根本不会有你跑过去的画面 因为9.6公里的赛程你少跑了3公里|There's not gonna be any footage of you running past Pritchett's Closets because you cut two miles out of a six-mile race.|
|356|00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,650|你最好告诉外公你没赢|Better tell Grandpa you didn't win.|
|357|00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,290|你真是我的道德指南针|Oh, you are my moral compass.|
|358|00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,480|所以我今天一天都不想再和你说话了|Which is why I don't want to talk to you for the rest of the day.|
|359|00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,380|卢克|Luke!|
|360|00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,130|帮我个忙  不许多问|I need a favor, no questions asked.|
|361|00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,470|你需要什么  电话卡吗|What do you need? Phone cards?|
|362|00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,150|不  我需要你合成一张 我今天跑过普利切特衣橱的照片|No. I need you to Photoshop a picture of me from today running in front of Pritchett's Closets.|
|364|00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,390|没问题|No problem.|
|365|00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,930|-没问题  -我... 我想拍张你和克莱尔的照片|- No problem. - I -- I want to grab a picture of you and Claire.|
|367|00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,610|我想上传到内缝线账号上|I want to post it on my Inseam account.|
|368|00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:27,740|内缝线是什么|Oh, what's Inseam?|
|369|00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,080|我用来找自制成衣图样的软件|I use it for home tailoring.|
|370|00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,210|-克莱尔  -怎么|- Claire. - Yeah?|
|371|00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,490|你能过来一下吗|Could you get in here, please?|
|372|00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,720|-我的两个超级明星  -好啊|- My two superstars. - Okay!|
|373|00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,200|真不敢相信你膝盖不好还赢了比赛|Can't believe you won with that bad knee.|
|374|00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:39,240|还好  如果有人想偷奖牌的话 他们得和这兄弟过过招|Well, at least if somebody tries to steal that thing, they got to get through this guy.|
|376|00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,550|我不过是做了任何英雄会做的事|I just did what any hero would do.|
|377|00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,810|-没什么  -你化妆了吗|- It's... - Are you wearing makeup?|
|378|00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:46,580|是的  为了遮脸上的淤伤|Uh, well, yeah. I got a bruise.|
|379|00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,010|你不是说你一喊就把他吓跑了吗|I thought-I thought you screamed and he ran away?|
|380|00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,140|我们还是发生了肢体冲突的|Uh, well, there was a-there was a scuffle.|
|381|00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,450|你听从了本能|You went with your instinct.|
|382|00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,400|反抗还是逃跑  你反抗了|Fight or flight. You fought.|
|383|00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,370|我要把这张照片发到内缝线上|I'm gonna post this on Inseam.|
|384|00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,870|双击|Double-click.|
|385|00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,020|该死的|Damn it.|
|386|00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,170|你反抗了|You fought.|
|387|00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,030|你反抗了|You fought?|
|388|00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,880|你跟这个"闯空门的"多近距离接触了|How close did you get to this "intruder"?|
|389|00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,600|克莱尔  你差不多够了|Okay, Claire. That is just about enough.|
|390|00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,710|米奇尔遭受了创伤 我不喜欢你这种嘲讽的语气|Mitchell suffered a trauma, and I don't appreciate your mocking tone.|
|392|00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,370|容我们失陪  好吗|Excuse us. Okay?|
|393|00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:12,980|谢谢你  亲爱的|Thank you, sweetie.|
|394|00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,980|我们都能确定两件事 我穿珊瑚色特好看 你根本没打跑过任何闯空门的人|Okay, look, we both know two things for certain -- I look fabulous in coral, and you didn't fight off any intruder.|
|397|00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,700|这是有背景故事的|There-There is a backstory.|
|398|00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,360|1984年夏天 在《小子难缠》的影响下 我那阵子特别沉迷于武术|In the summer of 1984, inspired by "The Karate Kid," I went through a martial arts phase.|
|401|00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,060|当小卡把那副双节棍拿回家时 我实在是无法抗拒|When Cam brought those nunchucks home, it was just too much to resist.|
|403|00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,330|你好啊  老朋友|Hello, old friend.|
|404|00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,210|三十年后  又一次到了 使出扫堂腿  技惊四座的时候了|30 years later, once again, it was time to sweep the leg.|
|406|00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,050|天啊  不|Oh, God. Oh, no!|
|407|00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,390|-你为什么不和我说实话  -我不知道|- Why didn't you just tell me? - I don't know.|
|408|00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,640|你进门就问我是不是有人闯进来了 我当时很窘迫  还可能脑震荡了 所以我就顺水推舟|You-You walked in, and you asked if there was a break-in, and I-I was embarrassed and possibly concussed, so I just -- I went with it.|
|411|00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,400|再说不能让我爸和克莱尔知道  明白吗|Besides, my dad and Claire cannot know, okay?|
|412|00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,740|《小子难缠》上映的那年夏天  他们都叫我"功妇" 火鸡10分钟后就好了|That whole "Karate Kid" summer, they called me "Kung Sue." Turkey is gonna be ready in 10 minutes!|
|414|00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,970|-菲尔在哪  -我会告诉他|- Where is Phil? - I'll let him know.|
|415|00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:14,930|好|Okay.|
|416|00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,480|-再10分钟  -我做不来|- 10 minutes. - I can't take it!|
|417|00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,510|你就深呼吸  老爸|Just breathe, Dad.|
|418|00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,850|我们要克服你的恐惧|We are breaking this fear of yours.|
|419|00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,690|我要死了|I'm dying here!|
|420|00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:23,670|看着我|Look at me.|
|421|00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,950|你想要你的余生 都只是一名开放空间魔术师吗|Do you want to spend the rest of your life as an open-space magician?|
|423|00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,920|这就对了|Yeah.|
|424|00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:35,210|杰  我在内缝线上看到乔的学校举办了 感恩节大会|Jay, I saw on Inseam that there was a Thanksgiving pageant at Joe's school.|
|426|00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,950|你为什么没告诉我|Why didn't you tell me?|
|427|00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,450|我忘了嘛|I totally forgot.|
|428|00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,850|乔一周没上学了|Joe hasn't been in school for a week.|
|429|00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,790|我跟他的老师起了点争执|I had a falling-out with his teacher.|
|430|00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,510|然后被叫去校长办公室|And got sent to the principal's office.|
|431|00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,770|你对巴里什老师说了挺难听的话|You said some pretty harsh things to Mrs. Barrish.|
|432|00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:54,710|那是因为她在计划的餐会 不符合史实|In my defense, um, this banquet she's planning is not historically accurate.|
|434|00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:00,220|比如说  我不记得在首次感恩节餐会上 有印度咖喱鸡啊|For example, I don't remember a tandoori chicken option at the first Thanksgiving.|
|436|00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,630|我们学校有不同文化种族的孩子 我们想让大家都有参与感|We have children here from many ethnicities, and we try to make them all feel included.|
|438|00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:09,650|尽管如此  史书上也没写过餐会时  印第安人 请英国探险家帮忙递生鱼片寿司卷 而英国知名军官也在一旁 给自己来点无麸质墨西哥煎蛋|Be that as it may, history does not record Pocahontas asking John Smith to pass the sashimi roll while Myles Standish helps himself to gluten-free huevos rancheros!|
|442|00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,100|之后火气越来越大  我们被逐出学校|After that, it got heated, and we got expelled.|
|443|00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,120|"我们"吗|"We"?|
|444|00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,400|他们会打来的|But they'll call.|
|445|00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,530|始终需要我的银子|They need my check.|
|446|00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,540|为什么学校什么都没告诉我|Why didn't the school tell me anything?|
|447|00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,130|好像我不在电邮通知名单上了|It's like I am off their e-mail list.|
|448|00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:32,900|我都没看到过他的变装服|I didn't even see the costumes.|
|449|00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,490|他不用变装啊|Well, he didn't have a costume.|
|450|00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,270|他是解说员  他负责说出整个故事|No, he was the narrator. Kid told the whole story.|
|451|00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,770|宝贝|Ay, papi.|
|452|00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,470|你当时一定超可爱|You must have been so cute.|
|453|00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:44,190|晚餐的时候给大家表演一次吧|Why don't you perform it for everybody at dinner?|
|454|00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,650|我去拿我的手机  我们得录下来|I'll go get my phone, and we'll film it.|
|455|00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,330|-好吗  -没问题|- Okay? - Yes.|
|456|00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,600|小家伙  我得最快时间帮你补课|I gotta get you up to speed in a hurry, buddy.|
|457|00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,140|感恩节的故事  开始|The story of Thanksgiving. Here goes.|
|458|00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,120|没用|It's no use!|
|459|00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,330|我做不到|I can't do it!|
|461|00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,830|我了个去  她成功了|Sonuvabitch, she did it!|
|462|00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,100|你们看到了吗|See that, people?|
|463|00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,620|又一个超越自己巅峰的人  都感谢我|Another person doing their best, thanks to me.|
|464|00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,290|现在可以开吃了|It's time to eat.|
|465|00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,590|谷歌 火鸡还要多久|Hey, Google, how much time left on the turkey?|
|467|00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,060|两分钟|Two minutes.|
|468|00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,660|看到没  我能控制那个神经病甜甜圈 也成功达到十万步|See? I can control that crazy doughnut, I can do the steps.|
|470|00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,370|我做到了两件事 而其他人只做到了一件|I have two achievements, and the rest have only one.|
|472|00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,180|所以外公真的靠 说你做不到什么而激励了你是吧|So, Grandpa really motivated you by telling you you couldn't do something, huh?|
|474|00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,620|我要看看这个计步器  我写报告要用|I need to see that My StepCounter for a paper I'm writing.|
|475|00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,330|大家都成功做到了一些事 现在轮到乔了|Everybody achieved something today, so now it's Joe's turn.|
|477|00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,370|乔|Joe...|
|478|00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:41,300|跟我们说说第一个感恩节的故事|tell us about the first Thanksgiving.|
|479|00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,360|来吧  小家伙|Come up here, buddy.|
|480|00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,410|你能行|You got this.|
|481|00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:47,250|曾有一片大地住着不信神的原住民|There was once a land of godless natives.|
|482|00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,680|他们愚蠢无知 直到某天  白人们来了|They did not know any better until, one day, the white man arrived.|
|484|00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,480|这是什么鬼|What is this?|
|485|00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,830|白人们可怜这些原始人 教导他们如何耕种土地|The white man took pity on these primitives by teaching them to cultivate the land.|
|487|00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:00,920|但他们的善良被误会为侵略 所以战争开打了|But their kindness was mistaken for aggression, and a war began.|
|489|00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,660|这是哪门子的鬼学校|What kind of school is this?|
|490|00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,460|-我小时候学到的也是这样  -什么|- This is what I was taught. - What?|
|491|00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:11,180|最后  一切回归和平 我们还送给了他们我国最高荣誉 让他们冠名橄榄球队|Eventually, peace was restored, and we bestowed them with our nation's highest honor -- naming football teams for them.|
|494|00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,930|乔  这是什么短剧|Joe, what play is this?|
|495|00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:22,070|我没有演出短剧  我都没上学了|I wasn't in a play! I don't go to school anymore!|
|496|00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,460|好啦  对啦|All right, fine.|
|497|00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,450|我们被踢出来了可以吗|We got kicked out, okay?|
|498|00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,080|跟校长小小吵了一架|Little argument with the principal.|
|499|00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,290|你怎么可以骗我 亏我还一直夸你是个超棒的父亲|You've been lying to me while I was celebrating you as an amazing father?|
|501|00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,070|歌洛莉亚  奇怪了|Hey, Gloria, this is weird.|
|502|00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,150|我下载了你的计步器数据 到我电脑里 数据显示你今早走的路线 跟我妈妈去赛跑的路线是一样的|You know, I downloaded your My StepCounter data onto my computer, and it's showing your path this morning was the same route my mom took in her race.|
|506|00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:48,220|我怎么可能跑得到十万步|I was never going to get 100,000 steps.|
|507|00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:51,360|一直到后来我知道克莱尔要去火鸡赛跑|But then I learned that Claire was going on a Turkey Trot.|
|508|00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,780|第二次我抱她时 比第一次不容易  因为她浑身是汗|The second time I hugged her, it was a little harder because she was really wet.|
|510|00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,460|所以我基本上就是你的计步代跑骡吗|So I'm basically just your StepCounter mule?|
|511|00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,990|我还以为你在乎我这场跑步呢|I thought you cared about my race.|
|512|00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,270|我很爱你  克莱尔 但我对你运动真的很没兴趣|I love you very much, Claire, but your exercise doesn't really interest me.|
|514|00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,380|等等  克莱尔什么时候经过公司的来着|Hang on. When did Claire run past Pritchett's Closets?|
|515|00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,920|因为上面显示她压根就没靠近过那里|'Cause this thing says she never got near it.|
|516|00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,340|爸  估计是计步器出错了|Well, it's probably the StepCounter made a mistake.|
|517|00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,000|是吗  还是... 还是你绕捷径了|Oh, yeah, did it? Or -- Or -- Or did you take a little shortcut?|
|519|00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,720|才没有  应该是我跑太快 它都跟不上我的脚步|No, I was probably going so fast it couldn't even keep up with me.|
|521|00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,140|-我有照片为证  -让我看...|- I have a picture of it. - Let me see.|
|522|00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,140|卢克|Luke?|
|523|00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,460|你们看|And there you go.|
|524|00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,240|很清楚能看到我跑过普里契特衣柜公司|That is me clearly running in front of Pritchett's Closets.|
|525|00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,460|对啊  窗上还有 84年总统大选的海报呢|Oh, yeah, yeah. With a Reagan/Bush poster in the window, huh?|
|527|00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,480|照片是假的|The photo is a fake.|
|528|00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,620|不能怪我  是曼尼改的图|It's not my fault. Manny made it.|
|529|00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,580|曼尼改了所有的图吗|Manny was photoshopping everything?|
|530|00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,910|所以乔真的发生危险了吗|So Joe was in real danger?|
|531|00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,550|我没想到你这么轻易 就能把线索都连上|I did not realize how easy it would be for you to connect those dots.|
|533|00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,110|对你挺失望的  卢克|Pretty disappointed in you, Luke.|
|534|00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,460|他从哪学坏的  我想大家都懂|Well, you know, it's easy to see where he learned it from.|
|535|00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,120|他老妈就是个骗子|His mother's a cheater!|
|536|00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,840|什么  你少跟我搞这套义愤填膺的了|What?! Oh, don't get so hot and bothered. Uh-huh! Mm.|
|537|00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,110|-你的妆都要花了  你这...  -别碰我|- Your makeup's already running, and what do... - Stop it.|
|538|00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,660|你的淤青上有个中文字吗|Do you have a Chinese character on your bruise?|
|539|00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,640|估计是闯入的人打我时  他戒指的字印的|Yeah, it's probably an imprint from the intruder's ring.|
|540|00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,980|他...  我确定他肯定是混什么帮派之类的|He was -- I'm sure he was in a gang of some sort.|
|541|00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,030|老实交代吧  米奇尔|Just give it up, Mitchell.|
|542|00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,590|他玩我以代理副校长职权 没收的双节棍时不小心打到了自己|He knocked himself out with some nunchucks that I confiscated as acting vice principal.|
|544|00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,090|天啊  功妇又回来了|Oh, my God! Kung Sue is back.|
|545|00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,160|老爸  你听到了吗|Daddy, did you hear that?|
|546|00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,560|小卡  小卡不是靠实力赢的球赛|Well, Cam -- Cam didn't really win the football game.|
|547|00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,360|他从对方女教练那里偷听人家战术|Uh-huh. He stole the last play from the lady coach!|
|548|00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,870|是意外  我不小心在我做为代理副校长 必需要有的对讲机里听到的 我对这职位感到十分骄傲 因为我基本就是个警长|Accidentally! I overheard it on a walkie-talkie that I require as an acting vice principal, which is a position I'm pretty proud of because I'm basically a sheriff.|
|552|00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,690|-你才不...  -就是  我基本就是警长|- You're not basically -- No. Yes, I am basically a sheriff!|
|553|00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:22,990|我戴着帽子|I wear a hat!|
|554|00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,350|爸要表演那个魔术了  他从来没做过呢|Dad is doing his trick, and he's never done it before.|
|555|00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,390|有可能会死|He could die.|
|556|00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,480|快来|Come on!|
|557|00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,460|菲尔  亲爱的  别啊|Oh, Phil. Honey, wait!|
|558|00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,670|-你不用做这个的  -我必须要做|- You don't have to do this. - Yes, I do!|
|559|00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:38,160|我是一大家人生赢家里的唯一废柴|I'm the only loser in a remarkable family of winners.|
|560|00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,200|不不  不是的|No, no, no!|
|561|00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,980|我们才不是什么赢家|We are not all winners!|
|562|00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,650|其实我们全都是废柴|It turned out we all stink!|
|563|00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:44,760|无所谓了|It doesn't matter!|
|564|00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,100|不想要被恐惧支配我的人生|I don't want to live a life ruled by fear!|
|565|00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,940|我今天就得表演这个魔术|I have to do this trick today.|
|566|00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,090|不过有点越来越难呼吸了|Although, it is getting hard to breathe!|
|567|00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,750|别停  老爸  你可以的|Don't stop, Dad! You can do this!|
|568|00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,770|我对你有信心|I believe in you!|
|569|00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:57,000|-这话说了没用啊  宝贝  -有意思|- That's not helping, honey! - Very interesting.|
|570|00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,810|我一鼓作气做完吧|Okay, I'm just gonna try to barrel through this.|
|571|00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,710|这里是诺曼底  我是美国大兵托尼·兰切提|It's Normandy. I'm an American G.I. Named Tony Ranzetti.|
|572|00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,100|我来自布鲁克林  我最爱我妈做的家常菜|I'm from Brooklyn, and I love my mama's home cooking!|
|573|00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,670|但我觉得我逃不出来了|But I don't think I'm gonna be able to get out!|
|574|00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:08,430|是托尼的台词  还是菲尔真逃不出|Is he talking as Tony Ranzetti or as Phil?|
|575|00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,770|你们这些孬种有病啊|What is wrong with you cowards?!|
|576|00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,320|菲尔需要帮忙|Phil needs help!|
|577|00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,820|功妇再次出击|Kung Sue's back at it.|
|578|00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,800|来不及逃啦|It's too late to get out! Oh.|
|579|00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,010|-不要啊  -这就是个错误|-No! -This was a mistake!!|
|580|00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:22,350|好像真的不对  老爸|Something's wrong. Dad?|
|581|00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,820|天啊  菲尔  菲尔|Oh, God. Phil! Phil!|
|582|00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,880|-天啊  -什  什么...|- Oh, my God! -What -- What...|
|583|00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:32,000|哇靠  他上哪去了|Holy crap, where'd he go?!|
|584|00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,900|兰切提二等兵报告  天神作战成功|Private Ranzetti reporting Operation Overlord is a success.|
|585|00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,450|鸡尾酒我请|Cocktails are on me.|
|586|00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,870|太厉害了  谁都不服就服你  菲尔|That was amazing! Gotta hand it to you, Phil.|
|587|00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,520|火鸡的大鸡腿给你吃|You get the big turkey leg.|
|588|00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,500|派对重新回到桌上|Let's take this party to the table!|
