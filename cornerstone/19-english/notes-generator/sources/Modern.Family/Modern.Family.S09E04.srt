23
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:03,740
真想知道曼尼现在在做什么
I wonder what Manny's doing right now.

24
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,410
你给他打个电话吧
Why don't you call him?

25
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:07,100
你打啊  我又不在乎他在做什么
You call him. I don't care what he's doing.

26
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,320
我在尽量不烦他
I'm trying not to bug him.

27
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,260
他说他需要一些时间来适应大学
He said that he needed some time to adjust to college,

28
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,080
所以我在给他
so I'm giving him --

29
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,060
停车
Stop the car!

30
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,350
你为什么要这样
Why would you do that?!

31
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,610
那好像是小短
I think that's Shorty.

32
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,790
从我开始记事
Shorty and I have been best friends

33
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,530
小短就是我最好的朋友
for as long as I can remember.

34
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,870
他和他老婆达琳几年前
He and his wife, Darlene, moved to Costa Rica

35
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,070
搬去了哥斯达黎加  原因是...  
a few years back for, uh -- 

36
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,330
我不知道
I don't know why.

37
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,840
吃豆子  抵抗疟疾  喝人们的洗澡水
Ruin his life eating beans, fighting malaria,

38
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,810
以此毁掉自己的生活吗
drinking water people bathe in?

39
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:33,620
这种时候
This.

40
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,770
你这种时候就听起来像有种族歧视
This is when you sound racist!

41
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,100
你回来都不告诉我的吗
You come to town and you don't tell me?

42
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,350
看老子不掐死你
I ought to punch you in the neck,

43
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,300
你这个王八蛋
you son of a bitch.

44
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,020
杰
Jay!

45
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,570
我要踢你的膝盖
I want to kick you in the knee,

46
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:44,750
你这个蠢蛋
you stupid idiot!

47
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:45,970
没这种说法
That might not be a thing.

48
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:47,350
你是个很垃圾的最好的朋友
You're a terrible best friend.

49
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,780
别冲我吼  我才回来几天
Don't yell at me. I'm only here a couple of days.

50
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,020
临时决定回来  本来有要打给你
It was last-minute. I was gonna call.

51
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:53,970
这是乔吗
This Joe?

52
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:55,320
你真大
You're huge.

53
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,920
我还能长更大
Eh, I can be bigger.

54
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,790
你干什么呢  住哪里
What are you doing? Where are you staying?

55
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:00,400
我住那边的酒店
I'm checking in at the hotel over there.

56
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,260
不能住酒店
No hotels.

57
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,300
你乱花钱  就跟乱穿裤子一样
You're as bad with money as you are with pants.

58
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,830
你穿的这是什么鬼
What's going on down there, anyway?

59
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:05,700
这裤子吗
These?

60
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,330
松身裤
Palazzos.

61
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,750
从未感觉如此舒适
Never felt so comfortable.

62
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,910
随心所欲  毫无阻碍
Everything goes where it wants to go.

63
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,150
小短  不如你来住我们家吧
Shorty, why don't you come and stay with us?

64
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,380
你还能有自己的房间呢
You will even get your own room

65
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,010
因为曼尼去上大学了 
'cause Manny's off to college.

66
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,000
上大学  他怎么样了
College?! How's he doing?

67
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,780
真希望我知道  他需要一些空间
I wish I knew. He needed some space.

68
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,400
在此期间
In the meantime,

69
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,740
她给他寄了个菲亚特汽车那么大的补给包
she sends him a care package the size of a Fiat,

70
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,950
里面还装着一包我最爱的香肠
which included a pack of my favorite sausage.

71
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:27,630
我没把香肠放...
I did not put the sausage --

72
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,900
不然香肠去哪儿了  我吃没吃我心里有数
Well, where did it go, then?! I know what I ate!

73
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,480
我现在有太多烦心事了
There's too many things upsetting me right now.

74
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,470
快去拿你的行李
Go get your stuff.

75
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,130
来我们家碰头  说定了
Meet us back at the house. It's done.

76
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,260
-没问题  -真棒
- You got it! ‭- Yes!

77
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,260
曼尼走了后  家里终于
It's gonna be so nice since Manny's gone

78
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,730
又有个有趣的人  真是太好了
to have somebody fun again in the house.

79
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,010
你准备好了吗  大哥哥
Are you ready for this, big boy?

80
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,070
我准备好了
Oh, I'm ready.

81
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:01,000
场面会很乱的
And it's gonna get pretty messy.

82
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,300
你想要当蓝色还是金色
So, do you want to be blue or gold?

83
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,240
当蓝色
I'll be blue.

84
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:06,730
因为我很酷...
'Cause I'm cool --

85
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,060
好痒
Aah! That tickles!

86
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,510
克莱尔最近去了个单身女郎派对
Claire recently went to a bachelorette party

87
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:13,500
他们送了每个人激情绘画工具
where they gave everyone a passion painting kit.

88
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,190
这个就是让你和你伴侣
The idea is that you and your partner

89
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,850
将身上涂满颜料
cover one another in paint --

90
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,740
趴在画布上
get down on the canvas.

91
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,510
然后"好好作画"
And then get down on the canvas.

92
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,050
别扭来扭去了  菲尔
‭Stop squirming, Phil.

93
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,180
我都没法给你涂颜料了
I'm never gonna get this paint on you.

94
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,210
好吧  我给你涂
Okay, I'll do you.

95
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,760
把你变成金色  就像奥斯卡小金人
You're gonna be so gold, you'll like an Oscar.

96
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,610
-有好多人要感谢呢  -是啊
- So many people to thank. ‭- Oh, yeah.

97
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,410
糟糕  是艾丽克斯
Oh, crap, it's Alex.

98
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:37,190
别接啊
Just ignore it.

99
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,120
不行  万一是出了什么事怎么办
I can't. What if something's wrong?

100
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,820
亲爱的  一切还好吗
Hi, honey. Everything okay?

101
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,200
是啊  我只是想告诉你
Yeah, I'm just, uh, letting you know

102
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,410
今晚我会家睡
I'm sleeping at home tonight.

103
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,210
你还有多久到
Uh, h-how far away are you?

104
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,260
大概二十分钟
About 20 minutes.

105
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,480
那我们有十分钟的时间清理
Oh, that leaves 10 minutes for cleanup.

106
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,690
还有  本今晚可以住家里吗
Also, is it okay if, um, Ben stays over tonight?

107
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,870
行啊  他妈咪同意就行
Sure. I guess if his mommy says it's okay.

108
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,140
妈  你没必要每次本来我们家
Mom, you don't have to take a shot at Ben

109
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,730
都要嘲笑他一次吧
every time he comes up.

110
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,720
就是嘛  我怎么可能没先问过我妈同意
Yeah, right, like I wouldn't ask my mom.

111
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,240
我真的该装作没听见吗
I'm really supposed to ignore that?

112
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,500
听着  他是我男朋友
Listen, he is my boyfriend,

113
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,200
-我真的要受够了  -冷静点
- and I'm getting really tired of this. - Oh, calm down.

114
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,960
-只是开玩笑啊  -一点都不好笑
- It was just a joke. - Well, it's not funny!

115
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,600
你攻击本  就等于攻击我
When you attack Ben, you attack me.

116
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,070
好了好了  我知道了
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

117
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,870
我们进行到哪儿了
Now, where were we?

118
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,370
亲爱的  我好像没感觉了现在
Honey, I kind of think maybe the moment has passed.

119
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,450
是我爸  又怎么了
Ohh, it's my dad. What now?

120
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,490
别接啊
Just ignore it.

121
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,460
不行  万一是出了什么事怎么办
I can't. What if something's wrong?

122
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,440
-亲爱的  -嗨  老爸
- Hey, honey. - ‭Hi, Dad.

123
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,580
小短来了
Shorty's in town!

124
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,760
我要我送给菲尔的那套高尔夫球杆
I need that set of golf clubs I gave to Phil.

125
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,130
反正给那笨蛋也只是浪费那套杆子
That bonehead's certainly not putting them to any good use.

126
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,240
为什么  老爸  你为什么老攻击他
Why, Dad? Why do you always have to attack him?

127
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,220
冷静点  只是开个玩笑啊
Oh, calm down. It was just a joke.

128
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,590
我明早来取
I'll pick them up in the morning.

129
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,500
我会被他气死
He pisses me off so much!

130
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,320
来吧  接着玩
Come on! Let's do this!

131
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,080
感觉你玩的目的不是因为我了
This doesn't feel like it's about me.

132
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,140
我要去冲个澡
I'm gonna hop in the shower.

133
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:44,970
什么
What?

134
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,300
你最近怎么了
What's been going on with you lately?

135
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,410
看起来很帅哦
You look so handsome.

136
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,480
谢谢  亲爱的
Oh, well, thank you, sweetie.

137
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,120
你知道吗
You know what,

138
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,820
我的护肤流程又多了一项精华
I added a serum step to my skin-care regimen.

139
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,960
等等
W-Wait a minute.

140
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,680
你就是想拐我们让你去上骑马课
You're just angling for horseback-riding lessons,

141
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:57,390
对不对
aren't you?

142
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,520
-拜托  -不行
Come on! ‭No.

143
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,330
不能让你变成那种日程满满当当的小孩
You're not gonna become one of those over-scheduled kids

144
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,670
13岁就过度劳累
that burns out at 13

145
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,220
还穿军靴去沙滩
and wears combat boots to the beach.

146
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,170
我是我们学校里最闲的亚洲小孩了
I'm the least-busy Asian kid in my school.

147
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,880
很好  拉住床单另一头
Great. Take the other end of this sheet

148
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,550
帮我给莱昂内尔铺床
and help me make up the bed for Lionel.

149
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,820
莱昂内尔今晚要住这里吗
Lionel's staying here tonight?

150
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,120
对  胡娇和罗纳多会送他过来
Yes. ‭Yes. Pepper and Ronaldo are dropping him off.

151
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,800
去年  胡娇和罗纳多告诉我们
Last year, Pepper and Ronaldo told us

152
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,220
他们想为人父母
that they wanted to become parents

153
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,350
而且正在努力搞到蕾哈娜的卵子
and were on a quest to acquire Rihanna's eggs.

154
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,350
我们说  "你们这俩富婆
And we said, "Or, you rich queens,

155
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,480
也可以给需要家庭的孩子一个家啊"
you could provide a home for a child that needs one."

156
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,420
所以他们领养了一个
So they adopted,

157
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,360
我们有点担心事情发展的情况
and we are a little nervous about how it's going

158
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,010
因为当他们头一回介绍莱昂内尔的时候
because, um, when they first introduced us to Lionel,

159
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,260
我们看得出来他们不是很合
we could tell that it wasn't a great fit.

160
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,520
莱昂内尔  很高兴认识你啊
Hi, Lionel, it's nice meeting you.

161
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,520
{\an8}3个月前

162
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,020
衣服挺酷
Hey. ‭Cool shirt.

163
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,040
是篮球变装服
It's a basketball costume.

164
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,210
是运动衫
Jersey.

165
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,620
是运动衫  对
Jersey. Right.

166
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:41,690
{\an8}《泽西男孩》是一档音乐剧
其中泽西与运动衫同词

167
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,700
就像《泽西男孩》
Like "Jersey Boys."

168
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,690
好了  谁给我杯喝的吧
Okay, somebody fix me a drink.

169
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,670
我们刚从车窗外买了芝士汉堡
We just got cheeseburgers out of a window

170
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,950
还坐在车里吃了
and ate in our car.

171
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,180
我们卖车时需要坦白受过这灾害吗
Do we have to disclose that when we sell it?

172
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,990
虽然一开始不太顺利
It seemed like a bit of a rocky start,

173
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,220
但胡娇说现在还挺不错的
but Pepper said it's going well.

174
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,780
看来做父母确实会改变你
Parenting does change you.

175
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,760
有莉莉之前  我有时候会很戏精
You know, before Lily, I could be so dramatic.

176
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,580
-而我以前总是紧张过度  -但看看我们现在
- Oh, and I used to be so uptight. - But look at us now.

177
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,120
-抱歉  -你的手差点儿伸到我嘴里了
- Oh, sorry. - Okay, your hand almost went in my mouth.

178
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,720
快进来
Come in, come in.

179
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,590
我好喜欢这个
Ohh! I like this!

180
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:05,520
这样比以前在这里的东西好看多了
It's a lot better than what was here before.

181
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,130
那里以前是我们的厨房
Uh, our kitchen was there before.

182
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,940
我刚才说的不够清楚吗
Am I being unclear?

183
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,800
莱昂内尔  你好时髦啊
Okay, well, Lionel, don't you look sharp?

184
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,970
是伦敦哈罗德买的巴宝莉  对吧
It's Burberry from Harrods in London. Right?

185
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,700
你这孩子太棒了
Ohh, you wonderful child.

186
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,410
你很快就再也不需要那些名牌学习卡了
You won't need those flashcards much longer.

187
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,340
给  莱昂内尔住这里用的
Here, for Lionel's stay --

188
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,120
一些小零食  洗漱用品
some snacks, toiletries,

189
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,190
还有一本设计杂志  你们俩也可以读读
a design magazine you two could also flip through.

190
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,270
好了  莱昂内尔
Okay, so, Lionel, uh,

191
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,730
我们给你在小房间里铺好床了
we have you set up here in the den.

192
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,870
电视也在那里
That's where the TV is,

193
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,750
小卡说我们家有订体育频道呢
and Cam tells me that we have a sports package.

194
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,840
没关系
That's okay.

195
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,250
我得练习写草书了
I should practice my cursive.

196
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,480
胡娇说书法是一门失传的艺术
Pepper says penmanship is a lost art.

197
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,290
是的  就跟感谢信一样要失传了
Yes. As are thank-you notes,

198
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,570
所以我们只能猜测
which is why we can only assume

199
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,410
你们很喜欢我们送的周年礼物
you enjoyed our anniversary gift.

200
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,440
总之  我们得去机场了
Anyway, we have to get to the airport.

201
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,760
再见怎么说呢  莱昂内尔
How do we say goodbye, Lionel?

202
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,720
再会[法语]
Au revoir.

203
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,710
送我们去门口吧
Come walk us to the door.

204
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,260
他们把他怎么了
What have they done to him?

205
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,950
把他变成了小"黑胡娇"
Turned him into a little black Pepper.

206
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,420
太气人了
It's so infuriating.

207
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,200
感觉她都没把你当个男人对待
She treats you like you're not even a man.

208
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,430
你不生气吗
Doesn't that bother you?

209
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,050
如果你讨好每个人
You know, if you please everyone,

210
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,540
你就没有取得足够的进步
you're not making enough progress.

211
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,530
雪莉·桑德伯格名言
Cheryl Sandberg.

212
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:09,420
{\an8}美国精英女企业家
此名言来自她鼓励女人追求目标的书籍《向前一步》

213
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,170
这是垃圾吗
Hey, is this garbage?

214
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,420
我不知道  里面有什么
I don't know. What's in it?

215
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:13,440
"激情情趣绘画工具"
Uh, "Passion Painting Erotic Art Kit"?

216
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,360
那是什么
What is that?

217
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,670
-天啊  -天啊
- Oh, my God. - Oh, my God.

218
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,820
太恶心了
Gross! Ugh! ‭Uh.

219
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,220
其实呢
You know what?

220
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,490
如果她想把你当个小孩来贬低
If she wants to belittle you like you're some child,

221
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,830
我们就用这个
we are going to use this

222
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,430
让她瞧瞧你有多男人
to show her what kind of man you are.

223
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,540
我不想我的T恤和袜子沾上颜料啊
I don't want to get paint on my T-shirt and socks.

224
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,520
那可能这次你得都脱掉了
Well, maybe you'll just have to take them off for this one.

225
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,920
早上好  怎么样啊  兄弟
Morning! How's my guy?

226
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,560
糟透了  我昨晚做了无数噩梦
Awful. I had a zillion nightmares.

227
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,720
我是和小短讲话  不过  你是挺惨啊
I was talking to Shorty, but gee, that's rough.

228
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,640
咱们一块去我的俱乐部吃早餐吧
Hey, let's have breakfast at my club today.

229
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,860
我们每周五会做一个"昨日土豆"
We do a thing on Friday called "Yesterday's Potatoes."

230
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,280
他们把前一天晚的炸薯条
They take last night's French fries

231
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,640
做成今天的家常土豆
and make 'em into today's home fries,

232
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,070
而前一晚的薯条超好吃啊
and last night's fries were fantastic.

233
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,560
听起来不错  但歌洛莉亚已经做好了
Sounds delicious, but, uh, Gloria already cooked.

234
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,260

237
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,840
天啊  你干嘛不直接给他打电话
Geez, why don't you just call him?

238
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,780
顺着习惯就做了的
I made it out of habit.

239
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:01,670
但幸好  小短喜欢
But thankfully, Shorty loved it.

240
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,100
是吧  亲爱的
Didn't you, Papi?

241
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,050
好吧  听我说
Okay, I'll tell you what.

242
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,150
你干嘛不换下那睡衣
Why don't you get out of those pajamas...

243
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:05,710
什么睡衣
What pajamas?

244
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,760
来坐  那不是睡衣吗
come sit while I -- Those aren't pajamas?

245
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,360
不是  其实呢  歌洛莉亚和我送乔上学后
No. Actually, Gloria and I are gonna go to the farmer's market

246
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,650
-打算去农贸市场  -为什么
- after we drop Joe off at school. - ‭Why?

247
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:13,970
算是跟我工作有关吧
It's kind of work-related.

248
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:16,830
你的朋友有着成功的果汁生意呢

250
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,070
他们称我水果之王[骚基之王]

251
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,060
他们肯定是看到你的衣服了  听我说

252
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,810
我今天早上办公室还有点事

for a little best-friend catch-up? Deal?

255
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,190
好的  听起来不错

一个爷们叫另一个爷们为最好的朋友

白面包加毛豆泥

Pepper says anyone who's still doing tomato-basil

262
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,320

missed the boat, or should have.

263
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,530
莱昂内尔  你不一定要吃
Hey, Lionel, you don't have to eat

264
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,880
他们给你带来的东西

265
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,960
我们不会告密的
We -- we won't tell.

266

但他俩费心

让罗莎给我做了这个

270
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,090
莱昂内尔  当心  接着

271
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,240
不了  谢谢

Well, you aren't at Pepper and Ronaldo's house.

274
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,600
这里是好玩之家
This is a fun house.

275
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,050
是啊  他们也这么叫
Yeah, that's what they call it.

276
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,580
现在我真的想扔东西了
Well, now I feel like throwing something,

277
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,620
莱昂内尔  注意啦  接着
so, hey, Lionel, heads up. Catch.

278
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,720
对不起
Uh, I'm sorry.

279
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,940
我和胡娇说了  穿这外套我胳膊动不了
I told Pepper I couldn't move my arms in this jacket,

280
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,530
但他说  "修身胜过合身"
but he said, "Fit over function."

281
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,800
不  没事  没事
No, you know what? I-It's fine. It's fine.

282
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,080
-东西碎了没什么  -我来赔
- Things break. - I'll pay for it.

283
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,630
不  你不用  那是我们在加油站
No, you won't. We got it for free

284
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,550
开信用卡时免费送的
when we opened a credit card at the gas station.

285
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:24,270
我坚持赔  我包里有旅行支票
I insist. I have traveler's checks in my bag.

286
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,990
不  莱昂内尔  没事的
No, Lionel, it's f-- okay.

287
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,460
不  这让我很难受
No, you know what, this is upsetting me.

288
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,760
他穿也受他们控制
He dresses the way they tell him to dress.

289
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,310
吃也受他们控制
He eats what they tell him to eat.

290
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,750
是啊  他们控制了他的一言一行
I know. They control his every move,

291
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,340
也很明显能看出他为了配合压力很大
and he clearly feels pressured to go along with it.

292
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,680
或许这就是为什么他一直对我说
That's probably why he keeps telling me

293
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,410
我能住在这很幸运
how lucky I am to live here.

294
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,800
他说了这种话吗  你怎么不告诉我们
He said that? Wh-Why didn't you tell us?

295
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,240
你们俩说话时不太给别人插话的余...
You guys don't leave a lot of space to jump into your conversat-

296
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,510
你知道这是怎么回事吗  小卡
You know what this is, Cam?

297
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,960
他明显很嫉妒莉莉
He's obviously jealous of Lily

298
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,410
因为我们允许她做个孩子  能尽情玩耍
because we allow her to be a kid and have fun.

299
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,440
如果他知道我能去学骑马
Imagine how jealous he'll be

300
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,320
想象一下他该有多嫉妒啊
when he finds out about my horseback-riding lessons.

301
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,630
-放弃吧  -想得美
- Let it go. - We're not doing that.

302
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,920
你知道我现在想吃什么吗
You know what I'm in the mood for?

303
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,010
我知道听起来很神经  但我想吃华夫饼
And I know it sounds crazy, but waffles.

304
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:58,910
什么鬼
What the hell?

305
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,330
你说得对  你总能阻止我浪过头
You're right. You keep me from flying too high.

306
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,600
"提前祝你生日快乐  妈妈
"Happy early birthday, Mom.

307
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,270
爱你的艾丽克斯和本"  我的天啊
Love, Alex and Ben." Oh, my God.

308
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,060
对啊  还有六个月才到你生日呢
I know. Your birthday isn't for six months.

309
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,210
不  菲尔
No, Phil!

310
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,180
二位好  这画挺酷的  谁画的
Hey, guys. Cool painting. Who did it?

311
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,600
艾丽克斯和本
‭Alex and Ben.

312
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,710
我昨晚好像听到他们作画了
Oh, I think I heard them making it last night.

313
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:21,220
她一直说他"做"得不对  但我看挺好的
She kept saying he was doing it wrong, but it looks good to me.

314
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,280
虽然我对艺术毫无了解
I mean, I don't know anything about art,

315
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,440
但  我了解自己喜欢什么
but... I know what I like.

316
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,170
我不过调侃一句本是妈宝
I make one comment about Ben's mommy,

317
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,740
艾丽克斯就来这一出
and Alex does this.

318
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,190
她太好斗了
It's aggressive.

319
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,140
感觉她用掌印画火鸡才多久之前
I remember when she made a turkey with her handprint.

320
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,230
她只是想气我
She's just trying to get

321
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,260
看我什么反应  对不对
some sort of reaction out of me, isn't she?

322
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,760
但你不会上钩的  对吧
But you're not gonna take the bait, right?

323
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,310
-你没那么小气  -我可说不好  菲尔
- You're bigger than that. ‭- I don't know, Phil.

324
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,840
她这可是对我们大不敬
This is-This is very disrespectful.

325
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,470
我觉得我们得挫挫她的锐气
I think she needs to be taken down a peg.

326
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,730
你打算坐下和她好好聊聊  对吧
So then, you'll just sit her down and talk to her, right?

327
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,320
那也行
I could do that,

328
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,120
或许在她和本过来一起吃晚餐时说
maybe over dinner with her and Ben...

329
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,640
这就对了  我为你骄傲
There you go. I'm proud of you.

330
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,370
一顿令人难忘的晚餐
...A dinner no one will soon forget.

331
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,470
好吧
Fine.

332
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,490
但我告诉你  我要去吃华夫饼了
But know that I'm having a waffle.

333
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,930
瞧瞧你对我们家做了些什么
This is what you're doing to our family!

334
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,250
停车  你知道规矩  戴好头盔
Stop. You know the rules. Helmet.

335
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,660
继续开吧
Off with you.

336
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,200
小短  你在说笑
Shorty, you're kidding.

337
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,910
我从不拿水果的事说笑
I never joke when it comes to fruit.

338
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:20,060
你手里的奇迹之果是李子和杏杂交的
That miracle in your hand is a half plum, half apricot.

339
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,400
想当初只有一起打成果汁才能让二者结合
There was a time they could only accomplish that in juice.

340
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,450
杰
Oh. ‭Jay.

341
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:27,220
不好意思  我一高兴忘记时间了
Oh, sorry, I kind of lost track of time.

342
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,450
别在意
Hey, no worries.

343
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,920
我不过是你四年没见的最好的朋友
Who among us hasn't blown off his best friend

344
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:33,800
{\an8}小短是在第5季第13集离开的

345
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,800
你为了买水果放我鸽子也是人之常情
he hasn't seen in four years to go fruit shopping?

346
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,630
感觉某人该来杯石榴葡萄大爆炸降降火
Sounds like somebody could use a Pomegrapefruit Blast.

347
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,470
"大爆炸"就是"酸奶"
Blast means "yogurt."

348
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,420
你在丛林里住得太久了
You've been spending too much time in the jungle.

349
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,480
你需要重新体验一下文明
What you need is a little civilization.

350
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,770
我们去打保龄球吧
Let's go bowling.

351
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,230
我很想去  不过...
Well, I would love to, but, uh...

352
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,010
我想在去剧院前睡一会儿
I kind of want to take a nap before we got to the theater.

353
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,430
-你要带小短去剧院吗  -是的
- Um, you're taking Shorty to the theater? - Ah, yes.

354
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,380
我买票本是想和曼尼一起去
I got the tickets for me and Manny,

355
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,360
但他不能去
but he can't go

356
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,930
小短又很喜欢《魔法坏女巫》
and Shorty loves "Wicked."

357
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,360
{\an8}又名《女巫前传》  是知名音乐剧
讲述《绿野仙踪》里那位坏女巫的故事

358
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,360
他觉得他像好女巫格琳达
He thinks he's a Galinda

359
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,120
他哥像坏女巫爱尔法巴
and his brother an Elphaba.

360
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,400
你意识到自己在做什么了吗
You know what you're doing, don't you?

361
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,960
你在把小短变成曼尼
You're turning Shorty into Manny.

362
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,570
别再霸占我最好的朋友了
Stop hogging my best friend!

363
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,210
好吧  如果你不爽  那你带他去
Okay, if you're so upset, then you can take him.

364
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,100
但别再说"最好的朋友"了
But stop saying "best friend."

365
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,790
你这个年纪不该用那个词了
You're too old to be using that word.

366
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:16,580
{\an8}麦莉·赛勒斯主演的青少年喜剧《汉娜·蒙塔娜》

367
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,870
蒙大拿的汉娜可以有最好的朋友
Hannah from Montana has a best friend.

368
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:14,780
而你不可以
You don't.

369
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,580
至少我最好的朋友不是我儿子
At least my best friend isn't my son.

370
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,170
我是你最好的朋友吗  妈妈
I'm your best friend, Mom?

371
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,360
是的  宝贝
Yes, Papi.

372
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,170
你就是他刚才说的那个儿子
You are the son that he's talking about.

373
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,320
如果他说莉莉能在我们家很幸运
Look, if he said Lily's lucky to be here,

374
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,640
那他显然在胡娇和罗纳多家过得不开心
then he's clearly unhappy at Pepper and Ronaldo's.

375
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,300
哪个孩子会开心啊
I mean, w-what kid wouldn't be?

376
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,450
他们家得维持那么一尘不染
I mean, that house is so sterile.

377
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,300
你记不记得那次胡娇生我气时
Do you remember when Pepper got mad at me

378
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,360
他先铺好塑料布
and he laid down plastic

379
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,830
才朝我脸上泼饮料
before throwing a drink in my face?

380
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,170
那我们必须得去说点什么吧
So then, we have to say something.

381
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,470
我们大家是朋友
‭I mean, we're their friends.

382
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,790
我们为人父母又比较有经验
We're experienced parents.

383
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,730
他们现在改还来得及啊
There's -- There's still time for them to change.

384
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,790
别  我们没资格管
No, it's not our place.

385
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,600
我们就...  别管人家家务事吧
Let's just, you know, stay out of it.

386
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,550
他们都不锁门吗
They keep their door unlocked?

387
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,020
这就是家里没什么东西可偷的好处
That's the upside of not having anything worth stealing.

388
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,330
你们是糟糕的父母
You're terrible parents.

389
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,870
好吧  看来我们还是要说
Okay, so, I guess we are saying something.

390
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:56,680
好了
All right.

391
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,060
是时候来点严厉的教育[激烈的爱]了
Time for some tough love, boys.

392
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,660
天啊  我们就害怕
Oh, goodness, we feared you two

393
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,140
你们俩喜欢那种"玩法"
might be into that sort of thing,

394
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,310
但我们还是免了吧
but we're gonna have to pass.

395
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,150
我才不信你真觉得他是这意思
Oh, you can't possibly think that's what he meant.

396
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,760
不  我在转移话题
No, I'm deflecting!

397
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:08,390
我感受到残酷坦诚的恶心威胁
I feel the sickening threat of brutal honesty,

398
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,890
我极其不舒服
and I'm wildly uncomfortable.

399
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,700
好吧  要开始了
Okay, well, here goes.

400
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,760
我们觉得你们收养莱昂内尔很好  但是...
We think it's great that you adopted Lionel, but...

401
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,790
好吧  这反应也太早了
Okay, a little early for that reaction.

402
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,840
我还没说到
I haven't even gotten to say,

403
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,060
"别把你们的花里胡哨强加到可怜的孩子身上"
"Stop imposing your fancy ways on that poor child."

404
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,110
可以反应了
And hit it.

405
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,740
我们做父母
Look, we have been at this parenting thing

406
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,450
也有一段时间了  而...
for a while now, and...

407
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,600
是啊  莉莉最"讨人喜欢"了
Yeah, and Lily is such a delight!

408
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:30,460
对不起  我可能会有点抬杠
Sorry, I'm gonna be lashing out for a bit.

409
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,050
总之  为人父母有时候
Anyway, um, part of parenting

410
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,590
就是要让孩子接触到你重视的东西
is exposing your children to things that you value.

411
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,670
比方说艺术  文化和好的食物...
You know, art and culture and good food...

412
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,370
我们就是这么做的
That's exactly what we're doing.

413
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,950
但有时候还要让他们发掘自我
But it's also about letting them figure out who they are,

414
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,670
做他们自己想做的事
doing things that they want to do

415
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,990
即使你们不喜欢
even though you don't like 'em.

416
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,180
他是个孩子
Yeah, he's a kid.

417
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,320
他不会想睡觉听歌剧和在鸡蛋里加鱼子酱
He doesn't want opera at bedtime and caviar on his eggs.

418
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,050
他...他想要玩球和吃奇多
He -- He wants to play ball and eat Cheetos.

419
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:56,230
我确实看见他把生鱼片吐到了餐巾上
Well, I did see him spit some sashimi into a napkin,

420
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,450
但我当时希望他只是在担心自己的体重
but I hoped he was just worried about his weight.

421
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,760
这样吧  我们出去
You know what, let's get outside.

422
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,180
我们做点开心的事  让莱昂内尔知道
Let's go do something fun and show Lionel

423
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:05,230
在你们面前做个孩子也没关系
that it -- that it's okay to be a kid with you guys.

424
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,610
你们觉得怎么样
What do you say?

425
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,490
-拿吧 -没关系
- Get in there. - It's fine.

426
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,020
这是用什么奶酪厂的...
And from what fromagerie...

427
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:21,760
-你就是个德州小城市人  -你个混蛋
- You're from Lubbock, Texas. - You son of a bitch!

428
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,180
没想到没人跟我说过
Oh, I can't believe no one told me

429
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,280
足垒球是在草上玩的
kickball is performed on grass.

430
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,570
在公园里演出的莎士比亚我都看不下去了
I can barely stand Shakespeare in a park.

431
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,330
这对你们族群可不太好
This is not great for your people.

432
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,370
好了  莱昂内尔  来个全垒打吧
Okay, Lionel, bring me home.

433
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,340
你可以的
You got this.

434
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,570
好的  先生
Yes, I do, sir.

435
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,470
好
All right.

436
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,540
太棒了
Yeah!

437
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,040
-天啊  发生什么了  -打他
- Oh, my God, what is happening? - Hit him!

438
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,090
胡娇  打他
Pepper, hit him! Oh!

439
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,090
打小卡
Hit Cam!

440
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:44,630
我的...
Oh, my --!

441
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,660
我才不信你真觉得他是这意思
You can't possibly think that's what he meant.

442
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,400
给我
Oh! ‭Give me that.

443
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,610
-给我  -好
- Give me that. - Okay.

444
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,790
我一开始也心里打鼓
I was skeptical at first

445
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,760
毕竟橙子过时很久了
because orange is so over right now,

446
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,980
但我很喜欢
but I love it.

447
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,460
你喜欢吗  胡娇
You like it, too, Pepper?

448
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,770
太好吃了
Mm, wonderful.

449
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,710
我上一次见到那么多人工色素[颜色]
I haven't seen this much artificial color

450
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,970
是《北非谍影》被修复成彩色版那会儿
since Ted Turner got his hands on "Casablanca."

451
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:03,690
{\an8}该知名杰出电影最早是黑白电影
被修复成彩色版后  许多影迷十分嫌弃

452
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,690
你爷爷奶奶是在拖车里长大的
Your grandparents grew up in a trailer.

453
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,250
我恨你
I hate you.

454
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:06,450
好了  下一个到谁了
All right, who's up next?

455
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,530
-胡娇  -胡娇
- Pepper! ‭- Pepper!

456
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,010
足垒球有多少幕
Oh. How many scenes does kickball have?

457
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,660
你可以的  胡娇儿
You can do it, Peppercito!

458
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,290
记住  就像跳舞一样
Remember, it's just like dancing.

459
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,460
跳舞
Dancing.

460
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:18,070
五  六  七  八  踢
And five, six, seven, eight, kick!

461
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:20,030
胡娇
Oh! ‭Pepper!

462
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:21,950
我受伤了
Ohh! Oh, I'm hurt!

463
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,240
疼死我了
I'm really hurt!

464
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,970
如果你们两个有钱的话  我会告死你们
Oh, if you two had any money, I'd sue you.

465
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,240
我亲爱的  没关系
Mi amor, it's okay.

466
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,880
有关系
It's not okay.

467
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,760
我在荒野曝晒  像个帮厨一样大汗淋漓
I'm out in the wild, schvitzing like a line cook.

468
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:35,380
一波接一波地被羞辱
It's one humiliation after the next!

469
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,710
莱昂内尔  亲爱的  我想要成为你要的父亲
Lionel, sweetheart, I want to be the father you need,

470
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,700
但这不是我
but this is not me.

471
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,190
我讨厌运动和大自然  还有
I hate sports and nature and -- 

472
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,880
还有果汁牛奶冻
and sherbet --

473
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,730
老天  我真讨厌果汁牛奶冻
God, do I hate sherbet!

474
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:52,050
世上只有冰淇淋和雪芭  没有中间的了
There's ice cream and sorbet and nothing in between.

475
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:52,050
{\an8}果汁牛奶冻由果汁和乳制品制成
雪芭由新鲜果汁和糖制成  不含乳制品

476
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,090
其实呢  我对篮球没兴趣
Just so you know, I don't care about kickball

477
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:57,330
或冰棒  或任何那一类的东西
or Popsicles or any of that stuff.

478
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,830
我喜欢我们的生活方式
I like how we live.

479
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,680
真的吗
You do?

480
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,410
莱昂内尔  不用因为压力而说违心的话
Lionel, don't feel pressured to say that if you don't mean it.

481
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,360
是真的
I mean it.

482
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,720
我喜欢书房里的西洋双陆棋  法国产的芝士
Backgammon in the study, cheese from France,

483
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,800
而不是戴着太阳眼镜的豹子
not a cheetah in sunglasses.

484
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,670
莱昂内尔  我的心都要被你融化了
Lionel, you're melting my heart.

485
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,860
我也是  你这个完美的孩子
Mine, too, you perfect boy.

486
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,700
你们怎么会觉得我不喜欢我们的生活
What made you think I didn't like our life?

487
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,930
是这样的
Well, now, see... ‭

488
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,490
他们强迫你
They were forcing you to,

489
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,330
-我们以为...  -我们觉得...
- and it just seemed to us... - It seemed to us...

490
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,290
你跟莉莉说她和我们住在一起很幸运
You told Lily that she was lucky to live with us.

491
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,460
-记得吗  -我是想让她心里好受一点
- Remember? - I was trying to make her feel better.

492
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,170
我拥有如此多  而她...
I got so much, and she got...

493
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,360
她的头发是他们在家剪的
They give her haircuts at home.

494
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,180
我可是上过培训课的
Okay, I took a class.

495
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,520
他们连骑马课都不让她去上
They wouldn't even let her take horseback-riding lessons.

496
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,180
-因为很危险  -因为很危险
- Because it's dangerous. - Because it's dangerous.

497
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,990
还是因为你们懒得早上7点载我大老远去上课
Or is it because you have to drive me across town at 7:00 A.M.?

498
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,330
优秀的家长
I thought good parents

499
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:42,960
不是应该满足孩子的愿望吗
were supposed to do things their kids want to do?

500
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,690
好吧  但也不是不危险
Okay, well, it's not not dangerous,

501
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,500
而且她还太小  所以...
and she's also too young, so...

502
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,940
小卡  算了  罪证确凿
Cam, come on. The jig's up.

503
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,770
没错  莉莉  我们太自私了
Yes, Lily, we were -- we were being selfish, okay?

504
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,740
你可以去上课
You can have your lessons.

505
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,850
谢谢
Thank you.

506
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,920
我能不能跟她一起上骑马课
Can I take horseback-riding lessons with her, too?

507
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,380
你想要什么都行
Anything you want.

508
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:00,530
你们可以顺路来我们家接上他
You can swing by and pick him up on your way.

509
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,270
我回来了
Hey, there.

510
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,410
老公  你怎么样啊
Hi, honey. How are you?

511
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,940
挺好的
Good.

512
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:10,130
你看上去没那么可怕了
Well, you seem less scary. ‭

513
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,230
这是不是代表我们会跟女儿和她男友
Does this mean we're gonna have a nice, pleasant dinner

514
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,890
共进一顿友好愉快的晚餐了
with our daughter and her boyfriend?

515
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,350
对我有点信心好吗
Hey, give me a little credit.

516
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,330
我忙了一整天
I worked so hard all day

517
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:21,130
就为了确保我把一切都准备好了
just to make sure I got everything ready.

518
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,470
不是吧
Oh, come on!

519
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,790
你一定是在逗我呢吧
You have got to be kidding me.

520
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,810
"极速画框公司"果然不负盛名
Well, it turns out Speedy Frame really lives up to its name.

521
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,850
我们来了
We're here!

522
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,730
克莱尔  我给你带了一瓶加州葡...  不
Claire, I got you a bottle of pi-- No!

523
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,240
太好了  你收到我们送的礼物
Oh, good, you got our gift.

524
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,410
你送给他们了吗
You gave it to them?

525
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,380
别慌  宝宝  她想要的正是这个
Don't freak out, babe. That's exactly what she wants.

526
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,290
妈妈  挂在那儿我真喜欢
Wow, Mom, I really love it there.

527
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,650
我也是
Me, too.

528
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,360
性爱画作挂到墙上说明艾丽克丝成功攻入她心
Sex painting on the wall means Alex was in her head.

529
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,700
而我攻进来就打算闹一阵子才走
And I wasn't planning on leaving anytime soon.

530
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,850
我不知道怎么会摆出这种手势
I don't know where that came from.

531
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,970
再来点豆角吗
More green beans?

532
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,850
好啊  我就不客气了
Oh, yes. Don't mind if I do.

533
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,990
我得承认  我感觉有点怪怪的
I have to admit, I feel slightly uncomfortable.

534
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,330
时候不早了
Well, it's getting late.

535
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:57,480
才七点半
It's 7:30.

536
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,960
爸爸  工作怎么样了
So, Dad, how's work?

537
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,770
不  我们不会坐在这里装没事
No. We're not gonna sit here and pretend.

538
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,360
我们要谈谈那幅画
We're going to talk about this.

539
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,440
你爸爸说得对
Your father's right.

540
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,510
我看到那幅画时  就觉得...
When I saw that painting, I thought...

541
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,610
你太克制自己了
you're too restrained.

542
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:14,170
-你们得放纵一点  -我要谈的不是这个
- You two need to loosen up a little. - That's not what I meant.

543
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,230
不不不
Oh, no, no, no.

544
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:18,700
我感激你的建议  而且这问题很容易解决
I appreciate the advice, and that should be an easy fix

545
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,920
毕竟我现在有一个"精"力充沛的伴侣
now that I've come into my own with such a virile partner.

546
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,090
天啊
Oh, my God.

547
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:24,780
够了
Okay, that is enough!

548
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,630
瞧你对这个可怜的男子做了什么
Look what you're doing to this poor man,

549
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,900
让他夹在你们俩之间扭曲变态的
putting him in the middle of this twisted power struggle

550
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,230
权力斗争中
between the two of you!

551
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,210
这正是你和你爸整天对我做的事
This is exactly what you and your dad always did to me.

552
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,560
你在说什么啊
What are you talking about?

553
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,220
我第一次见你爸的时候
The first time I met your dad,

554
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,870
他不认可我  你就一直亲我
who did not approve me, you kept kissing me.

555
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,360
还有我们第一次和你家人
Or the first time we went away with your family

556
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,260
去小木屋度假时  你故意各种呻吟
to that cabin and you made all those noises.

557
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,780
我呻吟不是为了气他
Th-That wasn't about that.

558
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,880
那如今这些呻吟都到哪儿去了  克莱尔
Then where did those noises go, Claire?

559
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:48,350
我不会束手旁观看着你手撕本
I will not stand here while you tear poor Ben down

560
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,550
就像你爸当年也手撕了我一样
the way that Jay tore me down,

561
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,730
还有  本  你是蓝色还是金色
and, Ben, were you blue or gold?

562
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,720
-我必须得知道  -我是蓝色
- I need to know. - I was blue.

563
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,810
我想要来点《阿凡达》的感觉
I wanted to feel like an Avatar.

564
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,810
{\an8}知名电影  剧中部分角色全身蓝色

565
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,390
本  是我不对
Ben, I'm sorry.

566
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,850
菲尔跟艾丽克斯说得对
Phil and Alex are right.

567
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:01,170
你不应该被如此对待
You don't deserve to be treated this way.

568
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:02,530
谢谢  克莱尔  其实我...
Thank you, Claire. You know, I --

569
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:04,410
我还没说完  我对你做的事
Not finished. I am doing to you...

570
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:07,410
就是当年我爸对我与菲尔做的事
...exactly what my father did to me and Phil.

571
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,990
他觉得任何人都配不上他的宝贝女儿...
No one was good enough for his little girl, and...

572
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:14,160
我想我也觉得没人配得上我的宝贝女儿
And I suppose nobody's good enough for mine.

573
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,960
但亲爱的  我也曾站在你这立场
But, honey, I've been where you are right now,

574
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,070
所以我是最不应该
and I'm the last person

575
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,710
给你增添无数磨难的人
who should be making it harder for you.

576
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:23,130
我真的很对不起
I'm...I'm so sorry.

577
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,520
我不该故意留下性爱画作给你们看
And I'm sorry I left the sex painting for you to find.

578
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,620
不知道你听完会不会开心点
If it makes you feel any better,

579
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,530
其实画是假的
we faked it.

580
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:31,170
本吓死了  根本无法"表现"
Ben was so freaked out, he couldn't perform.

581
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,830
我听了一点都没开心啊
Doesn't make me feel any better.

582
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,500
但我开心多了
That helps a lot.

从竞争对手变成至交  最后却因为立场不同成为敌人

595
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,470
我中间睡着了几分钟
I-I dozed off for a couple of minutes.

596
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,810
不好意思  借过一下
Excuse me. Excuse me.

597
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,180
对不起  不好意思
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

598

靠
Damn it.

599
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,130
早知道就该让歌洛莉亚来
I should've sent Gloria.

600
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,380
兄弟
Hey, fella.

601
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,130
你这是怎么了
What happened in there?

602
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,620
杰  我是个骗子
I'm a fraud, Jay.

603
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:31,500
我就是个大骗子
I'm a damn fraud.

604
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,010
别这样啦  人人都有怪异的哭点
Come on. We all cry at weird stuff.

605
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:36,240
像我是拳击手打完之后拥抱的那一刻
For me, it's when boxers hug after a fight.

606
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,210
我的重点不是哭
It's not the crying I'm worried about.

607
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,340
其实你说得没错
You were right.

608
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,970
你说过我要是去哥斯达黎加  就会倾家荡产
You said I would lose everything if I went to Costa Rica,

609
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:42,700
你说对了
and I did.

610
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,480
你在说什么鬼
What are you talking about?

611
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,140
你不是什么果汁业大亨吗
I-I-I thought you were a big juice magnate.

612
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,550
谎话  都是谎话
Lies! It's all lies, Jay!

613
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,070
我才不是什么果汁大亨
I'm not no juice magnate.

614
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:51,310
我开了个果汁小摊  本来一切顺利
I had a juice stand, and things were okay --

615
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:54,010
直到后来猴子拿到了我的刀...
until these monkeys got a hold of my knives.

616
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,700
律师说我不能谈这件事
The lawyer says I can't talk about it.

617
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:00,950
达琳也跟高空滑索的老板好上
Then Darlene takes off with this honcho in zip lines

618
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,130
然后离我而去
and leaves me.

619
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,880
所以我才一直躲着你
That's why I've been avoiding you.

620
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,460
我就是个丢人现眼的废物
I'm a disgusting loser!

621
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,830
你把我当什么人了
Who are you talking to?

622
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,360
在我面前你怕什么丢人
You don't need to be embarrassed.

623
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,720
但你说过"你到时候出事了
But you said, "Don't come crying to me

624
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,280
可别来找我哭  还要我帮你收拾烂摊子"
when it all turns to hell and I have to pick up the pieces."

625
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,540
-你说的  -也就是说说而已嘛
- You said that! - ‭It's just what you say.

626
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,260
我当然会帮忙你收拾残局啊
Of course I'm gonna pick up the pieces.

627
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,430
不然我还能怎么样
What else would I do?

628
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,680
你是我最好的朋友啊
You're my best friend.

629
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,170
妈的  你也是我最好的朋友啊  要抱抱
And you're my best friend, damn it. Come on.

630
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,610
因为认识你  我变得更好了
I'm better because I knew you.

631
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,000
一辈子当最好的好朋友
Best friends forever.

632
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:33,490
歌洛莉亚说得对  我现在懂了
Yeah, Gloria's right. I...I hear it now.

633
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,200
曼尼开门嘛
Manny open the door.

634
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,370
我知道你在房里
I know you are in there.

635
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,010
妈  你来做什么
Mom, what are you doing here.

636
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:41,260
我知道你说过你想有自己的空间
I know that you said that you want your space,

637
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:44,020
但对我来说真的很难熬
but it's so hard on me, ok?

638
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:47,720
所以我要你每天睡前给我发一封短信
So, I want a text message at the end of everyday,

639
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,220
跟我报平安
telling me you are ok.

640
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,620
然后每周三次
And three times a week,

641
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,900
发你的自拍给我
a picture of your face

642
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,060
这样我才能看着你的眼睛
so I can look into your eyes 

643
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,480
知道你有没有说谎骗我
and see if you are lying to me.

644
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,120
妈  我们昨天早上才互通过短信
Mother, we texted yesterday morning.

645
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,940
才没有呢  上次都多久之前了
No, we didn't. That was days ago.

646
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,140
昨天早上8点37分
Yesterday at 8:37A.M.

647
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,720
你问我收到你寄的补给包了没
You asked if I got your care package,

648
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,940
还让我别告诉杰你给我寄了香肠
and said don't tell Jay I gave you a sausage.

649
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,570
然后你不小心发了语音消息
Then you accidentally hit voice memo, 

650
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,920
我听到你叫斯黛拉找块地去死
and I heard you tell Stella to go in a yard and die.

651
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:12,990
对不起嘛  我好想你
Sorry. I just miss you.

652
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,240
你偶尔来看看我应该也没关系啦
I guess it's not so terrible of you stopping by every now and then.
