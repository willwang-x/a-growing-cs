1
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,000
我们有一个地方 一个院落
We have a place, a compound.

2
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,000
我们有一个社区
We have a community.

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,910
这里很安全
It's safe here.

4
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,200
你们有多少人？
How many of you are there?

5
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,620
其中有小孩吗？
Are any of them children?

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,750
沿着河过来是最快的方式
Because the fastest way to get here is by the river,

7
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,700
恐怕你带着小孩来不了
and I don't think you could make it with kids.

8
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,700
听好了 我只说一遍
Listen to me. I'm only gonna say this once.

9
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,370
我们要起程了 这次旅程会很艰苦
We are going on the trip now. It's going to be rough.

10
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,080
你们会觉得路程很长
It's gonna feel like it's going on for a long time,

11
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,040
所以很难保持警惕
so it's gonna be hard to stay alert.

12
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,080
更难保持安静 但你们必须保持警惕和安静
It's gonna be even harder to be quiet, but you have to do both.

13
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:05,950
你们必须严格按照我说的去做 不然我们到不了
You have to do every single thing I say or we will not make it.

14
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,160
明白吗？
Understand?

15
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,620
你们在任何情况下都不许摘下眼罩
Under no circumstance are you allowed to take off your blindfold.

16
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,330
如果我发现谁摘下眼罩 我会不客气
If I find that you have, I will hurt you.

17
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,950
明不明白？
Do you understand?

18
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,160
天很冷 我们有毯子
It's cold. We have blankets.

19
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,700
男孩 你有你的狗 女孩 你有你的猫
Boy, you have your dog. Girl, you have your kitty.

20
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:28,620
这里只不过是一个地方 我们不再需要这儿的其他东西
This is just a place. There's nothing more that we need from it.

21
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,500
你们明白吗？
Do you understand?

22
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,790
在河上不许说话
And no talking on the river.

23
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,700
你们一定要仔细听
You must listen as closely as you can.

24
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:42,540
如果你们听到树林里有动静 你们要告诉我
If you hear something in the woods, you tell me.

25
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,250
如果你们听到水里有动静 也要告诉我
If you hear something in the water, you tell me.

26
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,700
但你们绝对不允许摘下眼罩
But you never, ever take off your blindfold.

27
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,000
如果你们看了 你们就会死
If you look, you will die.

28
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,540
你们明白吗？
Do you understand?

29
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:00,450
没事的
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

30
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,330
- 猫咪。 - 没事的
- Kitty. - It's okay. It's okay.

31
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,500
我们走
Let's go.

32
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,410
好
Okay. Okay.

33
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,830
一 二 三 四 五 六 七 八
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

34
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,790
啊
Ah.

35
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,700
二十八 二十九 三十 这里 没事的
Twenty-eight, 29, 30. Okay, this way. It's fine.

36
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,250
三十一 三十二 三十三
Thirty-one, 32, 33.

37
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,540
在哪儿呢？
Where is it? Where is it?

38
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,250
∮ Whoa ∮

39
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,450
（五年前）
∮ I take as much ∮

40
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,290
∮ As I can get ∮

41
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:55,200
∮ I don't take ∮

42
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,870
∮ Any regret ∮

00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:05,910
∮ I think I'm com-- ∮

44
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:11,620
-混蛋 我正在听呢 -整条街的人都能听到
- Uh... asshole, I was listening to that. - Yeah, so were the people down the street.

45
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,540
超市里好多人 这件事好像挺严重的
The store was packed. This thing seems serious.

46
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,620
哇 你一点吃的都没有
Wow, you literally have no food.

47
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,700
-什么事？ -你在开玩笑吧？
- What-- What thing? - Are you serious?

48
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,580
-我说真的 -打开新闻 呆瓜
- I'm serious. - Turn on the news, dumb-dumb.

49
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:21,910
哼 呆瓜
Dumb-dumb.

50
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,790
-哪个频道？呆瓜 -随便哪一个
- What channel, dumb-dumb? - Any one of them.

51
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,450
机场和火车站关闭了
Airports and train stations have shut down.

52
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,540
街道上挤满了开车或行走出逃的人
Streets are crowded with people escaping cities by car and on foot

53
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,120
有目击者举报大量原因不明的自杀
as witnesses report unexplained mass suicides.

54
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,120
首先发起于罗马尼亚
First recorded in Romania,

55
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,540
正在迅速扩散到欧洲和西伯利亚
there's now an alarming spread of incidents into Europe and Siberia.

56
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,750
死亡人数已有数万
Estimated death toll is in the tens of thousands.

57
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:47,580
目前不知道是什么导致了欧洲和 俄罗斯的大量自杀
...don't yet know what is causing the mass suicides in Europe and Russia.

58
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,290
据目击者说 这些人有精神错乱表现
The eyewitness reports tell of people exhibiting psychotic behavior.

59
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,950
据我们收到的消息
Our sources are telling us

60
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,580
这看起来不是病理或病毒性的
this does not appear to be pathological or viral.

61
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,370
美国政府建议民众保持冷静
US authorities are advising the public to remain calm.

62
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,790
目前没有正式确认的情报…
There have been no officially confirmed inst--

63
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,700
哦 没事 是在俄罗斯
Well, it's in Russia, so...

64
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,700
这话要和那些抢矿泉水的家庭妇女说
Well, try telling that to the soccer moms fighting over bottled water.

65
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,200
说到家庭妇女 我刚给妈妈打完电话
Speaking of which, I just got off the phone with Mom.

66
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,620
怎么总是要我和她说你的情况？
How come I have to update her about you all the time?

67
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,950
-你们为什么一定要说到我呢？ -我可不想跟她聊我的生活
- Why do you have to talk about me? - I'm not telling her about my life.

68
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:20,040
我三点要去索萨利托看阿拉伯种马
At three o'clock, I'm gonna go check out an Arabian stud in Sausalito.

69
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,290
这句话可不是每天都能听到
See, now that is a sentence you don't hear every day.

70
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:26,250
-你想去吗？ -我去不了 我约了产科的拉帕姆医生
- You wanna come? - I can't. I've got my OB with Dr. Lapham.

71
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,790
-拉帕姆 什么时候？ -天呐
- Lapham, when? - Oh, my God.

72
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,790
你激动的时候声音为什么那么高？
Why does your voice get high when it gets excited?

73
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,410
-我送你去吧？ -不用 我没事
- How about I drive you? - No, I'm fine.

74
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,660
我可以进去 我们或许可以看看孩子
I can go in. We can maybe see the baby.

75
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,330
或者我可以取消和医生的约定 我们可以去看马
Or I can cancel the appointment and we can go and see a horse.

76
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,120
不要 让马见鬼去吧
No. Fuck the horse.

77
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,160
哇 这么恶毒
Wow. Such venom.

78
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,450
你觉得怎么样？
What do you think?

79
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:49,200
我看到一群人坐在一起
I think I see a whole bunch of people sitting together,

80
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,120
但他们都感觉很孤独
but they all feel incredibly lonely.

81
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,830
孤单是次要的
The loneliness is just incidental.

82
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,950
这幅画讲的是人们缺乏联系的能力
It's really about people's inability to connect.

83
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,580
缺乏和什么联系的能力？
Inability to connect to what?

84
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,870
-能让一下吗？ -马洛里
- Can you move? - Malorie.

85
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,620
-我需要你让一下 -我们讨论过这个
- I need you to move. - We've been through this.

86
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,910
你不会是那样的
- Mm-hmm. - That's not how it's gonna be for you.

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,700
你和孩子的感情不一样 那会是一见钟情
It's different with a baby. It's an immediate love affair.

88
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,700
-在我看来不会是那样的 -会的
- It's not gonna be that way for me. - Yes, it will.

89
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,830
-不会的 -你应该对孤独感到害怕
- No, ma'am. - You should be afraid of being alone,

90
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,200
而不是害怕这个
not of this.

91
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:22,500
我们该做的是带你到外面的世界
And what we need to do is get you...

92
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,500
去和其他人接触
...out into the real world with other people,

93
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,500
而不是整天待在屋子里
not stuck in this house all day. You never leave.

94
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,870
我为什么要出去？ 我有你帮我买日常用品
Why should I leave? I have you to get me groceries.

95
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,290
-你一定要搬家 -我不搬
- You have to move. - No, not moving.

96
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,540
-一定要 -不搬
- Yes, you do. - Not moving.

97
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,250
-为什么？ -我不搬 我喜欢这房子
- Why? - Not moving. I love my house!

98
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,790
我知道你花了不少时间 才找到你喜欢的工作室
I know it took you a long time to find a studio you loved,

99
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,290
自从瑞安走后 你的工作效率变高了
and ever since Ryan left, you've gotten a lot more work done.

100
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,870
但是 现在好了 不再有室友了
But, so fine, so no more roommates.

101
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,040
瑞恩不是我室友
Ryan was not a roommate.

102
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,830
可结果他是的
Uh, it turns out he kind of was.

103
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:48,540
反正你不能在这里抚养孩子 你连放她的地方都没有
Anyway, can't raise a kid here. Where would you even put her?

104
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,120
你怎么知道是个女孩？
How do you know it's a she?

105
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,910
我只是但愿
Wishful thinking, I guess.

106
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,410
抱歉 工作上有事 我很快就到
Sorry, it's work. I'll be there in a second.

107
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,750
你好
Hi.

108
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,790
对啊，他们只能把手术延后一个小时了
Yeah, they just had to push the surgery back an hour.

109
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:07,700
是的
Yes?

110
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,000
对
Yeah.

111
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,500
我马上打给你
I'll call right back.

112
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,700
什么？
What?

113
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,450
你还是不想知道孩子的性别吗？
You still don't wanna know the gender?

114
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,160
不想 那只会坏了惊喜
And ruin the surprise, Dr. Lapham? No.

115
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,330
你最近感觉怎么样？ 有没有睡得好一点呢？
How have you been feeling? Have you been sleeping any better?

116
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:25,830
不好
Rough.

117
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,660
我在有这个症状之前就睡得不好
I never slept well before I had this condition.

118
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,120
这叫做怀孕 你不用不好意思说出口
It's called pregnancy. It's okay to say it out loud.

119
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,790
医生你不知道吗？ 一件事情只要你不承认
Oh, don't you know, Doctor, if you don't acknowledge a thing,

120
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,830
它便会消失
it simply goes away?

121
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,160
哦 真的吗？我怎么不知道？
Oh, really? All this time, I had no idea.

122
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,040
-当一匹马怀孕的时候… -天呐 又是马
- When a horse gets pregnant... - God, the horse.

123
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,000
你懂马吗？
You know about horses?

124
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,950
当一匹马怀孕的时候 它会马上知道
When a horse gets pregnant, it knows right away.

125
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,910
真的吗？
Does it?

126
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,200
它吃东西的方式和走路的样子会改变
It changes the way it eats. It changes its gait.

127
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:49,040
其他马靠得太近 它会咬
It bites all the other horses who come too close.

128
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,250
-真可惜我们不是马 -是啊
It's too bad we're not horses.

129
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,790
做马真好 这样我们就会有一个
It is too bad. Great to be a horse. Then we would have, like, a mother

130
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,450
真正抚养我们的母亲
who would have actually raised us

131
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,410
和一个在遥远的马场的父亲
and a father off on some faraway stud farm.

132
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,910
等等 我们的父亲确实是在一个遥远的马场
Hold on. Our father was off on a faraway stud farm.

133
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,040
-没错 -没错
- That is correct. - That is correct.

134
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,750
我们真可怜
Poor us.

135
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,790
我们应该借午餐时间喝瓶葡萄酒聊聊 我们有多可怜
We should go feel sorry for ourselves with lunch and a bottle of wine.

136
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,580
你终于开始说人话了
Oh, finally, now you're making some sense.

137
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,750
-好 -你们非要在我面前说喝酒吗？
- Good. - Really, in front of me?

138
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,830
我们不是那个意思
We didn't mean it...

139
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,790
一小杯红酒伤不了这小豌豆
No, like a tiny glass of rosé is not gonna hurt the little bean.

140
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,540
我刚才听到的是喝一瓶酒
I'm pretty sure I heard the word "bottle."

141
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,750
除了小豌豆以外 你也许还得想个名字
You might want to think of a name besides "little bean"

142
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,120
你的孩子已经有一个小甜瓜那么大了
seeing as your child is now the size of a small melon.

143
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,080
小甜瓜！
Small melon!

144
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,000
我知道你很难爱上一个你没见过的人
I know it's hard to love someone you haven't met yet.

145
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,040
哦 你真会说
Oh, that's beautiful.

146
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,450
你有想过把那句话 缝在一个小背包上吗？
Thought about stitching that on, like, a little lavender sachet?

147
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,120
-放在礼品店里可以卖出去 -没错
- Could sell them in the gift shop. - In the gift shop.

148
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,580
马洛里 你要生孩子了
You're having a baby, Malorie.

149
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:44,700
不久 你、我还有杰西卡 以及一群强悍的产科护士
Pretty soon you and I, Jessica, and some hard-ass labor and delivery nurse

150
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,870
会在三楼开同样的玩笑
will be on the third floor making the same wise cracks.

151
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:49,580
只是这一次 你不会是一个人回家了
Only this time, you won't be going home by yourself.

152
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,370
我知道
I know. I know.

153
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,620
但如果这不是你想要的
But if that's not what you want,

154
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,500
有很多夫妻渴望着收养一个孩子
there are plenty of couples who are desperate to adopt a child.

155
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,750
这无关对错 你可以做你想做的决定
There are no judgments here. You can make whatever choice you want.

156
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,660
但你不能无视它 希望它就这样消失
But what you can't do is ignore it and hope it just goes away.

157
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,000
（考虑领养？怀孕让人迷惑）

158
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,540
你在里面没事吧？
You okay in there?

159
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,120
我没事
I'm great.

160
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,080
你吐了吗？
Are you puking?

161
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:27,830
你先到车里去
Just go to the car.

162
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,120
是大块的吗？
Is it chunky?

163
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,250
不是 就是那种直接喷出来 很干净的
No, it was actually the really smooth kind that just shoots out real clean.

164
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,120
我们车里见 好吗？
I'll meet you at the car, okay?

165
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,790
-在走廊里 -走道让出来
- In the corridor. - Let's get it clear.

166
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,500
嘿！警卫！

- You feel better? - It's happening now.

172
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:21,700
有没溅到身上？
You get any on you?

173
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,370
在俄罗斯让大家发疯的东西 到我们这里了
The thing in Russia that's making everybody crazy, it's here now.

174
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,200

178
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,330
我们直接去圣罗莎
We're going straight to Santa Rosa.

179
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,950
在这鬼东西结束之前 你待我家
You can stay at my place until whatever the fuck this is isn't.

180
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,330
-我没有衣服 -你可以穿我的
- I don't have any clothes. - You can wear something of mine.

181
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:54,330
你的马场服饰不适合我
I'm not much of a chaps-and-boots gal.

182
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,290
你现在还在想穿什么？
You're worried about what to wear right now?

183
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,580
想其它事情会给我安慰感
Well, I find it comforting to focus on the wrong things.

184
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,080
-妈的 -怎么了？
- Shit. - What?

185
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,330
马路中间停了一辆车
There's a car stopped in the middle of the fucking road.

186
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,370

-让开 让我走
Move. Let me go.

188
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,830
这事要是变得更糟 我们就得离开马路
If this thing gets any worse, you'll wanna be off the roads

189
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,700
只能骑马了 相信我

-是马场工头在找我 -好 静下来想想
- It's the foreman wondering where I am. - Right, just hold your horses.

199
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,080
你把它放哪了？

有事…喂？
Something... Hello? Hello?

248
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,790
它会搞乱你的神经系统
That thing fucks with your nervous system. I've seen it in my clients for weeks.

249
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:46,200
我在客户体内看到这东西 已经有好几个星期了
I've seen it in my clients for weeks.

250
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:47,750
嘿 我有没有说我是警察？
Hey, did I mention I'm a fucking cop?

251
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,950
你上警校 不代表你是警察
You're in the Academy. Doesn't make you a cop.

252
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,660
不管这是什么 很快有人会被派过来
Whatever it is, I'm sure they'll send someone soon.

253
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:59,660
很快会发生的唯一件事是我们都会死
No, the only thing that will happen soon is we're all gonna die soon.

254
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,750
这具有典型的生物战的特征
This has a classic bio-warfare signature.

255
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,620
一定是朝鲜或伊朗
North Korea or Iran.

256
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,540
道格拉斯 目前还没有人知道是什么
Douglas, that's it. They don't know what it is yet, okay?

257
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,660
我们都要保持冷静
We just all gotta try to stay calm.

258
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,040

我们真他妈完蛋了
We are so fucking fucked.

261
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,250
我好像听见了
I think I heard one.

262
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:24,370
我们正在街上跑 我敢肯定 我感觉到什么
We were running up the street, and I swear to God, I-- I felt something.

263
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,500
-我听到了什么 -你看到了吗？是什么？
- I heard something. - Did you see it? What was it?

264
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,450
我不知道 但我能感觉到
I-- I don't know. It was just there.

265
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,200
-它的存在？ -对
- The presence? - Yeah.

266
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,000
真他妈完蛋了
So fucking fucked.

401
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:11,790
汤姆 这安全吗？
Tom, is this safe?

402
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:13,200
-闭嘴 -别吵 拜托！
- Shut up. - Hold on, please!

403
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,250
-好了 遮好了 -好
- Okay, it's all covered. - Okay.

404
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,790
进来吧
I got you. Come on.

405
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:19,870
等等
Hold on. Hold on.

406
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:22,910
我们没事了
We're good.

407
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:26,620
-马洛里 -嗯
- Malorie. - Yeah.

408
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,250
-请你把枪放下 -嗯
- The gun, please. - Yeah.

409
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:31,830
你都不知道怎么用 小心打死别人
Yeah, before you kill someone with it since you have no idea how it works.

410
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:38,330
没事了
It's okay.

411
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,580
你们…
How...

412
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,540
怎么有那么多人？
There are so many of you.

413
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,120
你是…
So are you, um...

414
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,830
你怀孕了吗？
Are-- Are you pregnant?

415
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,080
是啊 十月一号生
Yeah. October 1st.

416
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:56,790
你呢？
What about you?

417
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,580
九月底
Uh, end of, uh, September.

418
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,410
等等 外面还是乱成一片吗？
Wait. Hold on. Is shit still going crazy out there or what?

419
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,410
你是一个人吗？
Are you on your own?

420
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,330
是的
Yeah, I am.

421
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:11,830
我丈夫是空军部队的 上个月被派遣出去了
My husband was deployed last month 'cause he's in the Air Force.

422
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:14,370
我试图省着吃
I tried to make stuff last as long as I could, um...

423
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,450
但我太饿了 我怕饿了我的孩子
but I was so hungry and I was afraid I would starve my baby,

424
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,870
我不知道该怎么办
so I didn't know what to do.

425
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,410
-来 喝点水 -谢谢你
- Have some water. - Thank you.

426
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,000
所以你出来敲别人家的门？
So you left and started knocking on random doors?

427
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,620
我家离这里只有一个街区
I only live a block away.

428
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,000
太好了 我们都等着在这妇产病房挨饿吧
Great, now we can all starve here in the maternity ward.

429
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,500
这只意味着我们需要补充食物用品
It just means we need to get more supplies.

430
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,950
当然 可我们看不见就什么也拿不了
Of course, but we can't get anything if we can't see.

431
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,700
哦 我们他妈被困在这里了
Oh, we're so fucking trapped.

432
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,120
或许不是
Maybe not.

433
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,370
也许我们不是什么都看不了
Maybe we can see better than we thought.

434
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,910
你什么意思？
- What do you mean?

435
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,870
过来
- Come here.

436
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,080
房子周围有摄像头传输实时监控
We have cameras around the house transmitting a live feed.

437
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,500
上楼 来吧
Come upstairs. Come on.

438
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,790
这只是数字化信号
It's a digitized signal.

439
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,250
它只会显示物体的色温
It just shows the color temperatures of the objects.

440
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,450
这只是被处理过的信息
It's neutered information.

441
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,200
-只是显示器上的图像 -对 但是图像依然可能有力量
- Colors on a flat screen. - But an image can still have power.

442
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:08,250
我们不知道这些东西是怎么运作的
We have no idea how these things can operate.

443
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:09,870
这些图像不是直接的
These images are not direct.

444
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:13,080
我们不能用肉眼看那些东西
We can't look at whatever it is with the naked eye,

445
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,290
但或许我们可以用数字信号来看
but maybe we can with a translator.

446
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:17,160
只是像素和热量
Pixels and heat.

447
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,370
也许它根本不会出现
Maybe it won't even show up.

448
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:22,450
不让一个人试试怎么知道？
Well, we're not gonna find out until one of us takes a look.

449
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,200
我看这是一个天大的错
I think it's a huge mistake.

450
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:28,080
你当然会 道格拉斯 你觉得所有事都是天大的错误
You would, Douglas. You think everything is a huge mistake.

451
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,620
我们早晚都得做些什么
Sooner or later we're gonna have to do something.

452
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,830
我们不知道电还能维持多久
We don't know how long we're gonna have electricity.

453
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:35,330
你们要相信我 我觉得这能行
You gotta trust me on this. I really think this is gonna work.

454
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,040
好吧
Okay. Okay.

455
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,160
要是管用的话 我们可以用这种科技去拿食物
Maybe if it does, we could use the technology for supply runs or---

456
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,160
没错
Exactly.

457
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,830
别太紧
Just not too tight.

458
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,620
我希望你知道你自己在干什么
I hope you know what you're doing.

459
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:51,410
听我说 你和你丈夫都是好人
Listen... you and your husband, you're good people.

460
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,870
不是…
You know, it wasn't... It wasn't that.

461
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:54,870
不是那个什么

462
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,120
谢谢你 道格拉斯
Thank you, Douglas.

463
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,290
你不是必须这样做
You don't have to do this.

464
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,790
我知道 别担心
I know. Don't worry.

465
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,580
-汤姆 我需要遥控器 -是
- Tom, I need the remote. - Yeah.

466
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:09,830
在这里呢
There you go, bud.

467
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,580
你为什么要告他？
So why are you suing him?

468
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,700
因为他们想把房子的这一侧拆掉
'Cause they want to tear down this part of their house

469
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,750
搭什么大玻璃屋
and build some glass monstrosity.

470
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,750
他丈夫是个建筑师
His husband's an architect.

471
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,330
这是他的房子 他建什么和你有什么关系？
It's his property. Why do you care what he builds?

472
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,330
因为碍我的眼
Because I have to look at it.

473
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,000
你没机会
Not a chance.

474
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:30,250
世界要结束了 宝贝 谁都说不好
Well, the world's ending, baby, so you never know.

475
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,580
Hmm.

476
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,290
你在哪儿？混蛋
Where are you, motherfucker?

477
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:06,580
（产前复合维生素）

478
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,250
加油 格雷戈
Come on, Greg.

479
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:21,330
集中注意
Focus.

480
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:37,370
这小说是关于世界末日的
It's, uh... It's about the end of the world.

481
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,370
我写的
My novel.

482
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:43,580
但不像那种儿童故事 拿着弓箭
But it's not one of those kids' stories where they all got crossbows

483
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,910
为了生存互相追杀 或者在一个大迷宫里跑来跑去
and they're killing each other to survive or running around some giant maze.

484
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:51,750
这个故事...
- Mm-hmm. - No, this story is, um...

485
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,750
这个故事会是很真实的
This story's gonna be real.

486
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,950
你有想过会是像现在这样吗？
Did you ever think it was gonna be anything like this?

487
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,370
-格雷戈 -我们能进来吗？
Greg! Greg, can we come in?

488
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,870
-发生什么了？ -格雷戈
- What's going on? - Greg!

489
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,250
格雷戈 我们能进来吗？
Greg, can we come in?

490
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,120
别看！
Look away!

491
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:33,950
遮住眼睛 -快找遥控器
Cover your eyes! Cover your eyes. Find the monitor.

492
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,250
-格雷戈
- Greg. - Greg.

493
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,330
格雷戈
- Come on, Greg.

494
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:37,750
格雷戈
- Greg?

495
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:41,040
在我这里
- Shit. - I've got it here.

496
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,540
好！可以睁开眼睛了 可以看了
Okay! Okay! Okay! You can open your eyes. You can see.

497
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:58,620
我早就告诉过他别这样
I fucking told him that it was a mistake.

498
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:00,250
来吧
Come on.

499
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,330
我们得走了
We got to move. We got to move.

500
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:06,790
对不起 我真的对不起 - 我们得走了
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - Come on. We gotta go.

501
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,290
我们永远出不去了
We're never getting out of here.

502
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:13,580
没有人会来救我们
No one's coming for us.

503
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,870
没有人会来救我们
No one's coming for--

504
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:15,910
我们得走了
We need to go.

505
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,500
你好
Hi.

506
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,000
你好
Hi.

507
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:57,330
我想或许我们走得近一点会更好
Yeah.I thought it might be good for us to be close considering...

508
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,120
当然
Sure.

509
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,950
这样我们就不会孤单了
You know, this way, we won't be lonely.

510
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:06,830
我在网上看过的文章里说
I read this blog post once about how pregnant women

511
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:10,000
孕妇应该每天睡在一个人旁边
should always sleep next to someone

512
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,750
因为当母亲有孤独感的时候 胎儿会感受到
because the baby can sense when the mother is lonely.

513
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:14,450
太好了
Perfect.

514
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,370
你有想过起什么名字吗？
So, um... have you thought about names yet?

515
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,080
还没有
No, not yet.

516
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:24,330
你呢？
How about you?

517
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:30,040
如果是女孩 我们想管她叫爱丽儿或者茉莉
Well, if it's a girl we wanted to name her, like, Ariel or Jasmine.

518
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:34,330
我很想给她取名叫辛德瑞拉 然后直接叫瑞拉
I mean, I would love to name her Cinderella and just call her Ella.

519
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:39,500
那你丈夫喜欢什么？
And what did your husband like?

520
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,290
我喜欢的他都喜欢
He loves everything I love.

521
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:46,500
那你呢？你丈夫有喜欢的吗？
What about you? Does your husband have a favorite?

522
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:48,540
哦 我是一个人
Oh, it's just me.

523
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:52,120
-抱歉 -不用 没关系
- Oh, I'm-- I'm sorry. - No, it's fine. It's fine.

524
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:55,410
那你的家人呢？他们一定很兴奋
Well, what about your family? They must be excited--

525
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,500
不好意思 我得出去一下
Do you know what? Could you just excuse me for one second?

526
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,620
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

527
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,500
对不起
Sorry.

528
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,450
看了一次 你忘不掉了
That's something you can't unsee.

529
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,000
肯定忘不掉
Ah, no. No, you cannot.

530
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,080
是
Yeah.

531
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:09,910
对不起
Sorry.

532
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:10,290
嘘
Shh.

533
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:13,580
嘘
- Shh, shh. - Hmm.

534
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,040
你还好吧？
Are you okay?

535
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,160
嗯
Yeah.

536
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:26,370
我等早上再洗衣服吧
I'll wait to do my laundry in the morning.

537
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:29,580
-那样更好 -没错
- That's probably a good idea. - Yeah, I think so.

538
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,790
晚安
Good night.

539
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:57,830
（在河上已十四小时）

540
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,290

- It's okay to take your blindfolds off. - Do not take your blindfolds off. Do not!

543
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:18,700
我这里有吃的 孩子们一定饿了吧
I got some food. Those kids look hungry.

544
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:21,200
蹲下！快点

547
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,700
我告诉你们一个秘密
I'll tell you a secret.

548
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,250
我在树林里找到了一只
I found one in the woods.

549
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:51,080
我知道你们很害怕 但没有这个必要
Okay. I know you're scared. Well, listen, there's no need.

550
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:58,540
我不是来伤害你们的 我可以拉你们上岸
I'm not here to hurt you. I can pull you to shore.

551
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:10,450
把你的眼罩给我摘下！
Take your goddamn blindfold off!

552
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,160

00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,660
我看到过 我见过真相
I've seen one. I've seen the truth.

554
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,830
把你的眼罩摘下
Take your blindfold off.

555
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:35,040
它很美丽的 摘下你的眼罩
It's beautiful. It's beautiful. Take your blindfold off.

556
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,160
摘下你的眼罩！
Take your blindfold off!

557
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:56,330
它将净化这个世界
It shall cleanse the world!

558
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:58,620
每个人都必须看
Everyone must look.

559
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:01,200
每个人都必须看
Everyone must look.

560
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,000
我有坏消息要宣布
Got some bad news.

561
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:17,000
我们快没有食物了 没有人会来救我们
All right. We're running out of food and there's no help coming.

562
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,200
我们必须出去
We've got to get outside.

563
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:24,450
我知道哪里有吃的
Look, I might know where we can get more.

564
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:27,450
-在哪？查理 -在我工作的超市
- Where, Charlie? - The Fields market.

565
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,120
当事件爆发以后 我把超市锁起来了
I locked the place up when everything started going crazy.

566
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,580
-你怎么到现在才告诉我们 -至少我们现在知道了
- You're just telling us this? - At least we know now.

567
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,870
谢谢
Thank you.

568
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:37,250
我们需要一队人
Okay, so we'll need a group of us to go.

569
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:39,120
我们还没到那儿 就肯定死光了
Whoa. We'll be dead before we get there.

570
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,830
-别开玩笑了 -我去
- Are you kidding me? - I'll go.

571

- Well, if he's going, I'm going. - You're pregnant!

572
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:46,750
如果你们都去的话 那我也去
Well, if all you guys are going, then I can come too.

573
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:51,250
要不这次我去 下次你去
Why don't I go on the first run and then you can go on the second run?

574
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:52,620
-我也去 -什么？
- I'll come. - What?

575
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,950
-你这是求死 -我有训练过 没事的
- It's a death wish. - I have the training. It'll be fine.

576
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,450
我有不好的感觉 我觉得大家还是都别去
I don't like this. I don't think anyone should go.

577
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,370
-我们有四个人 -五个 查理也去
- There are four of us. - Five. Charlie's going.

578
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:02,750
查理也去？查理哪儿也不去
Charlie's going? Charlie ain't going nowhere.

579
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:05,200
-你了解防盗系统 -我绝对不会去的 好吗？
- You know the security system. - No chance I'm going.

580
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:07,200
我给你们提供了信息
I gave you the information. That's all you needed.

581
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:09,830
你不需要我给你们指路 那是个超市
You don't need me to tell you where to go. It is a supermarket.

582
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:12,000
超市有标牌 你们去超市买过东西
They got signs. You've been shopping before.

583
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,000
你想买谷物 牌子上会写着谷物
You wanna get cereal, the sign will say cereals.

584
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,950
如果你们不识字 我能理解 但你们识字
If you can't read, I get it, but you can read.

585
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:20,790
-你们不需要我和你们一起去 -查理 这可以为你的小说提供素材
- No. You don't need me to go with you-- - Charlie. It'll be research for the book.

586
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,830
怎么样？会很棒的
Okay? Be awesome.

587
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:29,620
如果我们可以遮住所有车窗
All right, so the idea is if we can black out all the windows,

588
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,250
既有效率又安全
it's efficient and it's safe.

589
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:33,870
有人在听这话吗？
Is anybody else hearing this?

590
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,080
盲着开车怎么会安全？
How is driving blind safer?

591
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,080
我们不是盲着
We're not.

592
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,620
我们有导航仪
We've got the GPS.

593
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,290
正在计算行程
Calculating route.

594
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:30,910
继续直行
Continue straight.

595
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:38,620
在800米后右转进入海岸街
In half a mile, turn right onto Bay Street.

596
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,500
-怎么回事？ -压到路牙子了
- What is that? - It's a curb.

597
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,790
路牙子
It's just a curb.

598
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,040
那是距离感测器
It's a proximity sensor.

599
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:05,000
只是个路面减速带
Just a speed bump. It's just a speed bump.

600
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:09,870
右转
Turn right here.

601
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:30,750
-我们不在马路上了吗？ -没有 有东西
- Are we off the road? - No, there's something.

602
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:34,200
-我觉得应该是个卡车 -绕过去
- I think it must be just a truck. - Just go around.

603
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:36,250
-一直绕过它 -嗯
- Keep going around it. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

604
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:39,950
怎么回事？
What was that?

605
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:52,040
外面有其他人在开车吗？
Is somebody else driving out there?

606
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,200
-操！去他妈的 -查理 冷静一下
- Charlie, breathe. - Shit! Fuck this shit.

607
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,200
-出去！ -查理！冷静
- Get the fuck out! - Charlie! Calm down.

608
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:10,290
大伙别碰他了
Guys, stop touching him.

609
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:12,910
-看着我 你一定要小声点 -让他闭嘴
- Look at me. You have to be quiet. - Shut him up.

610
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,450
啊
Ah. Ah!

611
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,910
操！我们要死了
Fuck! We're not gonna make it.

612
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:31,040
冷静
Calm down. Calm down.

613
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,330
-天呐！ -大家抓紧了
- Oh, shit! - Everybody, hold on.

614
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:36,450
抓紧了 我们要走了！
Hold on to something. Gonna move!

615
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,910
啊
Ah!

616
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:39,950
抓好！
Hold on!

617
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,500
那可不是路面减速带！
That's not a fucking speed bump!

618
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:43,540
-操 卡住了 -抓紧
- Fuck, it's stuck. - Hold on.

619
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:45,700
左转
- Turn left here.

620
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:47,330
慢点！
- Slow down! Slow down!

621
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,330
已到达目的地
You have arrived.

622
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,250
怎么回事？
What the fuck?

623
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:01,790
经历了刚才的事情后 我们现在要下车吗？
And after all this, we're supposed to get out now?

624
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,540
我们真幸运
Lucky us.

625
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,910
-我数三下 一… -我准备好了

627
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,370
那是什么？我撞到了什么？
What was that? What did I just hit?

628
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:16,870
是一根柱子
That's just a pillar.

629
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:20,910
好 门在…
Okay. Where's the--

630
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,830
再走几步应该就到门了
The door should be just a couple of paces up, man.

631
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,450
-我找不到 -在你左边
- I'm lost. - Towards your left.

632
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:26,950

Let's not forget. We have limited space. Stick to non-perishables, the necessities.

651
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:32,660

654
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:40,500

661
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:12,200
我姐姐要生第四个孩子了
So, my sister is expecting her fourth, so...

662
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:15,250
天呐 她真是个圣人
Oh, my God. She's a saint.

663
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:16,540
她的确是
Yeah, she is.

664
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,700
我经常摸她肚子
And I'm always touching her belly.

665
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:22,040
很有舒缓作用
It's calming.

666
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,750
是啊 是大自然耍的小花样
Yeah, it's nature's dirty little trick.

667
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:30,450
你姐姐住在萨克拉门托吗？
Is your sister in Sacramento?

671
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:44,330
斯托克顿城外

674
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:52,500
-我老爸是个真正的牛仔 -你就是从那里学来的…
- Well, my daddy was a real cowboy. - That's--That's how you learned your...

675
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:54,040
-什么？ -…散弹枪技术
- What? - ...little shotgun trick.

676
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,370
是 我的童年很有趣
Yeah. I had an interesting childhood.

677
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:57,330
Hmm.

678
00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:01,410
但托克顿离萨克拉门托不远
Ah, but Stockton wasn't all that far from Sacramento.

679
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,750
不远 顺着99号高速过去
No. Just down 99.

680
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:06,200
-99号高速 没错 -区别很大 是吗？
- Just down Highway 99. - Worlds apart, right?

681
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:10,120
我们仍然可能在其他情况下认识
Still we could've met some other way.

682
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:12,330
当然
Sure.

683
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,120
我也有可能做你的保姆
Could have been your babysitter.

684
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:19,040
性感的保姆
My hot babysitter.

685
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:26,040
你这么说只是因为我们都快要死了
You're... You're only saying that 'cause we're all gonna die.

686
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:28,790
或许吧
Possibly.

687
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:08,080
你们怎么那么幸运？
How did you guys get so lucky?

688
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:10,500
哈？
Huh?

689
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,040
嗨
Hi.

690
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,370
你们好
Hi, there.

691
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:22,450
好困
So sleepy.

692
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:27,500
所有顾客注意 请到第七排来
Attention, all shoppers, come to aisle seven, please.

693
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:31,540
我有一件很大的事要宣布
I have a?big, big, big, big, big announcement to make.

694
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:34,540
-女士们先生们 请… -什么事？道格拉斯
- Ladies and gentlemen, please... - Yes, Douglas.

695
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:40,830
我想借此机会发表祝酒词 敬我们大家
I would like to take this opportunity to make a toast to all of us...

696
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:48,250
因为我们一起让世界末日…
because all of us, collectively, are making the end of the world...

697
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:52,580
再一次美好！
great again! Yeah!

698
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:00,580
小鸟
Birdies.

699
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,870
你们这帮笨蛋到现在还不明白吗？
I mean, don't you doofuses get it?

700
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,950
我可以待在这里
Uh, we could just stay here.

701
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:14,250
这里有我们一年的吃喝用品
We have a year's supply of food and drink right here.

702
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:17,660
我们不用花钱 我们不应该走
We don't ever have to pay and we shouldn't ever leave.

703
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:19,950
那在格雷戈家里的人怎么办？ 等着饿死吗？
And what are they gonna do at Greg's? Starve?

704
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,120
比我们饿死好
Better them than us.

705
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:27,700
这里有我们生活需要的一切
We have everything we need to live here. Everything.

706
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:34,080
我们在统计学、逻辑和法律的角度上 没有任何理由回去
There is no statistical, logical, or legal argument for trying to get back there.

707
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,290
我给你个理由 我们不是混蛋
Here's an argument: we're not assholes.

708
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:40,700
我们不能待在这里
And we're not staying.

709
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,000
怎么回事？
What is it?

710
00:48:57,330 --> 00:48:59,160
查理 那里面是什么？
- Somebody let me out of here. - Charlie, what's behind there?

711
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:00,410
是装货码头
It's a loading dock.

712
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,000
你好？
Hello?

713
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,450
让我进来
Please let me in.

714
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:07,910
大声点 我听不见
Speak up, I can't hear you.

715
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,870
请让我进来
Please let me in.

716
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:12,750
遮住眼睛
Cover your eyes.

717
00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:14,290
-什么？ -我要开门了
- What? - I'm gonna open the door.

718
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:16,540
-不行 -外面有个人
- No. - There's a person out there.

719
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:17,660
我一定要开
I have to open the door.

720
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:21,540
好
Okay.

721
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,120
好
Okay. Uh...

722
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:25,950
好
Okay.

723
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:30,870
-你好 -你好
- Hello? - Hello.

724
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,790
让我进来 我被困了
Please let me in. I'm trapped.

725
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:36,620
等等 鱼条 是你吗？
Wait, wait, wait. Is that... Fish Fingers, is that you?

726
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:39,950
-查理 对 是我 -查理 谁是鱼条？
- Charlie, yeah, it's me. - Who's Fish Fingers, Charlie?

727
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:43,000
他和我一起在这超市上班 他在海鲜部工作
He works here at the supermarket with me. He works in the seafood department.

728
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:46,450
他坐过牢 有点疯 但一直对我挺好的
He's been to prison and he's a bit crazy, but he's always nice to me.

729
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:48,830
-你是怎么进去的？ -我…
- How did you get there, man? - I got... I got...

730
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:50,580
他们骗了我
They tricked me!

731
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:51,620
他们是谁？
Who's they?

732
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,700
你在指谁？你是一个人吗？
Who you talking about? Are you there alone?

733
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:55,750
他们骗了我 他们把我丢在这里等死
They tricked me and they left me to rot here.

734
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:57,660
谁把你丢在那里等死？你在说什么？
Who left you to rot? What are you talking about?

735
00:49:57,950 --> 00:49:59,330
大伙 有事不对劲
You guys, there's something wrong.

736
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,080
-有事不对劲！ -让我进来 我被困了
There's something wrong!

737
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:04,370
- Please let me in. I'm trapped.

738
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,370
嘿 嘿 嘿
- Hey. Hey. Hey.

739
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:06,750
你在干嘛？鱼条 你在干嘛呢？
What are you doin', Fish Fingers? What are you doing, man?

740
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:10,910
朝它看 它想让你看到它 让我进来！
Look at it! It wants you to see it! Let me in!

741
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:17,080
他力气太大了 我挡不住他
He's too strong. I can't hold him.

742
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,000
让我进来！
Let me in!

743
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:19,910
妈的
Shit!

744
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:23,620
查理！
Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!

745
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:24,620
操！
Fuck! Ah!

746
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,410
查理 等等！
Charlie, wait!

747
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:31,950
看 查理 它很美
Look at it, Charlie. It's beautiful.

748
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,000
-查理？ -查理！
- Charlie? - Charlie!

749
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,290
-查理！ -查理！
- Charlie! - Charlie!

750
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:39,910
-妈的 -见鬼！
- Oh, shit. - Oh, fuck.

751
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,040
天呐！
Fuck!

752
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,290
我们得走了
We gotta go.

753
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:51,500
我们得走了 快点 我们走
We gotta move. Come on. Let's go.

754
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:52,950
快点离开这里
Let's get out of here.

755
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,950
让我进来
Please. Please let me in.

756
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:02,040
那个人怎么还活着？
How is that guy alive in there?

757
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:04,290
让我进来
Please let me in.

758
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:29,580
费利克斯！
Hi, Felix!

759
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:31,660
天呐
Oh, my God.

760
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:33,160
看有好多东西
Look at all this stuff.

761
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:36,080
-小鸟？ -对
- Birdies? - Yeah, they, uh...

762
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,660
它们会感觉到灵体靠近
They seem to sense when the creatures are around.

763
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,620
查理呢？
Where's Charlie?

764
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:44,950
这样我就不用读他的小说了
Another novel I won't have to read.

765
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:47,790
他救了我们 你这个混蛋
He saved us, you fucking asshole.

766
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:12,200
我知道你对我是什么看法 也知道大家对我的看法
I know what you think of me, what everybody thinks of me.

767
00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:14,200
在离婚申请书上
You know, in the divorce petition...

768
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:20,620
我第一个妻子说 管我叫混蛋是对混蛋的侮辱
my first wife said that to call me a creep would be an affront to creeps everywhere.

769
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:25,290
我第二个妻子说她再也不怕下地狱
My second wife said she no longer feared going to hell,

770
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:28,410
因为地狱不可能比和我在一起还要差
'cause it couldn't possibly be worse than being married to me.

771
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:30,290
我想她们很适合做我朋友
Think I would have loved them.

772
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:31,540
或许吧
Maybe.

773
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:33,080
后来我娶了莉迪亚
And then Lydia.

774
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,080
第三次婚姻可真是我的福气
Third time really was the charm for me.

775
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:40,870
她是我见过最善良的人
She was the kindest person I ever met.

776
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:44,370
可是她走了 而我还在 你知道为什么吗？
But I'm here and she's gone. You know why that is?

777
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:47,040
因为最终这世上只剩两种人
Because, in the end, there are only two types of people.

778
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,120
一种是混蛋 一种是死人
The assholes and the dead.

779
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,410
天呐 你听上去像我父亲
God, you sound like my father.

780
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,250
像你父亲？为什么？
Like your father? Why?

781
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:58,580
他是一个教导傻瓜的智者吗？
Was he a towering intellect given to dispensing wisdom to undeserving fools?

782
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:00,500
没错 也很会说风凉话
Yes, he was fluent in asshole as well.

783
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:06,450
像你一样 他做的所有事 都会归咎于一些大道理
And just like you, he blamed everything he did on some deeper meaning,

784
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,120
一些错综复杂的阴谋论
convoluted conspiracy theories and...

785
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:13,040
即使他明显错了 他还是会怪罪别人
how it was everybody else's fault when he was clearly in the wrong.

786
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:16,450
但是当我和我妹妹发现
But, you know, once my sister and I realized it was just an excuse

787
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:20,250
这只是他对家人不好的借口后 我们想通了
to treat his family like shit, it made life a little easier.

788
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:23,290
知道我们之间有什么区别吗？
You know what though? I see one difference between us.

789
00:53:24,370 --> 00:53:26,580
-什么？ -我从来不犯错
Hmm? I'm never wrong.

790
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:29,790
你们俩都是同一类人渣
You are...You're two pricks in a pod.

791
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:32,330
我长得也像他吗？
Do I look like him as well?

792
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,120
嗯..
Mm...

793
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,160
不怎么像
Not really.

794
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,250
他不像我这样精致帅气吗？
- He wasn't exquisitely handsome?

795
00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:40,450
不是这个 只是…
- It's not that, it's just...

796
00:53:42,370 --> 00:53:43,580
你们的发型不一样
the hair... the hair is different.

797
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:45,910
-发型？ -对
- The hair? - Yeah.

798
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:48,040
他有点头发
He had some.

799
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:49,450
哦
Oh.

800
00:53:58,330 --> 00:54:00,040
哦 我不能喝
Oh, I can't.

801
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:02,870
哦 没关系的 世界末日要来了
Oh, come on, the world is ending.

802
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:06,870
我想一杯威士忌改变不了什么
I really don't think a quarter-ounce of whiskey's gonna tip the scales, do you?

803
00:54:10,370 --> 00:54:11,290
那好吧
Well...

804
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:13,830
我希望你是错的
I hope you're wrong.

805
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:16,700
剩下的不只是混蛋和死人
About the assholes and the dead.

806
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,370
我希望有更多种人
I hope there is more.

807
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:24,370
为希望有更多种人 干杯
Here's to hoping there is more.

808
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:49,080
-关上车库的门 -我来
- Close the garage. - I've got it.

809
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:51,750
等等
Wait. Wait. Wait.

810
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,330
-遮住眼睛 -好
- Cover your eyes. - Yeah.

811
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,540
关上了
Okay, okay, okay. It's closed. It's closed.

812
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,450
这些混蛋
Sons of bitches.

813
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:02,250
车到哪去了？
Where's the goddamn car?

814
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:04,200
露西和费利克斯去哪儿了？
You guys. You guys, where are Lucy and Felix?

815
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:14,370
操
Fuck.

816
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:32,160
（在河上已二十四小时）

817
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:44,580
你不划了
You stopped rowing.

818
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:46,790
我休息一下
I'm just taking a break.

819
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,580
还要多久？
How much longer?

820
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:50,700
几个小时
A few hours.

821
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:11,950
啊
Ah!

822
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:16,500
马洛里！
Malorie!

823
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:20,330
马洛里！
Malorie! Malorie!

824
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:21,370
救我！
Help!

825
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:23,870
马洛里！
Malorie!

826
00:56:29,870 --> 00:56:31,540
你没事吧？
- Are you okay? Are you okay? - Yes.

827
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:34,330
-我冷 -我知道 等一下
- I'm cold. - I know. I know you're cold. Hold on.

828
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:42,000
不 我们所有吃的和毯子 该死！
No, no, no, no, no, no. All the food and blankets. God damn it!

829
00:56:43,290 --> 00:56:44,830
-对不起 -没事
- I'm sorry. - No, no, it's...

830
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,160
等等
Hold on.

831
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:48,790
好 没事
Okay. All right.

832
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:51,330
-没事 -我好冷
- Okay. - I'm so cold.

833
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:55,080
我们会让你暖和起来的 好吗？
We're gonna get you warmed up, okay? We're gonna get you warmed up.

834
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
把毯子盖好
Put this around you.

835
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:01,040
眼罩不要摘掉 坐稳了
Keep your blindfolds on. Stay tight.

836
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,200
你们听见了吗？
Did you hear that?

837
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:07,660
你们听见了吗？
Did you hear that?

838
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:21,040
躺在船底 躺好 躺平
Lay down on the bottom of the boat. Lay down, really flat.

839
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:23,540
你们一定要小声 我把鸟留在这里
I need you to be quiet. I'm gonna leave the birds with you.

840
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:26,540
我要把你们盖起来 不要发出声音 不要离开船
I'm gonna cover you up, but do not make a sound and do not leave this boat.

841
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:28,080
明白吗？千万不能离开船
Understand? Do not leave this boat!

842
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,040
妈的！
Shit.

843
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:50,830
马洛里
Malorie.

844
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:52,750
马洛里
Malorie.

845
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:57,040
马洛里
Malorie.

846
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:09,830
马洛里出事了
Something is wrong with Malorie.

847
01:01:09,910 --> 01:01:12,160
马洛里
Malorie.

848
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:13,330
啊 啊
Ah! Ah!

849
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:47,830
马洛里？
Malorie?

850
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:54,580
马洛里？
Malorie?

851
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,290
马洛里？
Malorie?

852
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:09,450
我让你待在船上的呢
I told you to stay on the boat.

853
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,040
你不需要思考
You don't think.

854
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:13,500
你按照我说的话做 不然你就会死 明白吗？
You do exactly what I say or you die, do you understand me?

855
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:16,250
万一我出了事 不要来救我
If something happens to me, do not try and help me.

856
01:02:16,330 --> 01:02:18,160
一定要抛下我 救你自己
Forget about me and try to save yourself.

857
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:19,620
明白吗？
Do you understand?

858
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:22,830
说！万一我出了事 你怎么办？
Say it! If something happens to me, what do you do?

859
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:25,290
救你自己 快说！
You save yourself. Say it!

860
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:27,910
-我会救我自己 -你救你自己
- I save myself. - You save yourself.

861
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:31,080
我没法儿信任你了
I can't trust you.

862
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:52,830
世界末日会让我们做出疯狂的事
The end of the world makes us do things.

863
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,700
这不是世界末日
- It's not the end of the world.

864
01:02:55,790 --> 01:02:56,660
真的吗？
- Really?

865
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:58,790
感觉好像
It sure feels like it.

866
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:08,250
在我被派去伊拉克的最后一段时间 我们驻扎在一个村里
At the end of my deployment in Iraq, we were stationed at this village...

867
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:13,500
我们奉命在街上巡逻 确保大家安全
ordered to patrol the streets, make sure everybody was safe.

868
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:16,950
有一天早晨 我们看到
One morning, we saw...

869
01:03:18,410 --> 01:03:20,660
一个父亲带着他的四个孩子在走
this father walking with his four kids.

870
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:23,450
所以我停下来确保一切都没事
So I pulled over to make sure everything was okay

871
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:26,370
确保他安全到达他想去的地方
and to make sure he got wherever he was going safely.

872
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,330
后来知道 他是送他孩子上学
Come to find out, he was walking his kids to school.

873
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:36,160
在那片狼藉
In the middle of all that shit,

874
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:39,370
混乱之中 他在送他孩子上学
all that chaos, he was walking his kids to school.

875
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:47,200
所以
So...

876
01:03:50,790 --> 01:03:52,200
我们就跟着他
So we just followed him.

877
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:54,830
日复一日
Day after day.

878
01:03:55,450 --> 01:03:56,500
我们都会护送他
We escorted him.

879
01:03:59,950 --> 01:04:01,540
这成为了我们的一个习惯
That just became our routine.

880
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,500
然后 在我们最后的日子
And then, at the end of our time,

881
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:10,250
当我要回家了的时候 他给了我这个
he gave me this when it was time to come back home.

882
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:17,620
嗯
Mm.

883
01:04:23,830 --> 01:04:26,500
希望他依然还在送他孩子上学
I like to think he's still walking his kids to school.

884
01:04:58,330 --> 01:05:03,660
（在河上已二十八小时）

885
01:05:07,290 --> 01:05:09,450
喂 有人听到吗？喂
Hello, can anybody hear me? Hello?

886
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:12,330
我是马洛里 有人吗？能听见吗？喂
This is Malorie. Anybody, can you hear me? Hello?

887
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:18,580
有人听见吗？喂 有人听见吗？
Can anybody hear me? Hello? Hello? Can anybody hear me?

888
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:22,830
喂 信号测试 喂
Hello? Testing, hello?

889
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,160
喂 有人在吗？喂？
Hello, is anyone out there? Hello?

890
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:30,120
能听到吗，拜托？
Can you hear me, please?

891
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:32,200
-喂 信号测试 -你是…
- Hello? Testing. - Are you a...

892
01:05:32,290 --> 01:05:33,700
你戴着眼罩吗？
Do you have a blindfold on?

893
01:05:34,370 --> 01:05:37,620
你身后的毯子还挂着吗？
You do. Is-- Is the blanket behind you still up?

894
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,790
啊
Ah...

895
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:42,250
好 快点进来
Okay, just come in really, really quickly.

896
01:05:42,330 --> 01:05:45,790
谢谢 我的眼罩在这里 非常感谢你
Thank you. Here's my blindfold. Thank you so much.

897
01:05:45,870 --> 01:05:49,370
没事 在这里等一下 马洛里！
It's okay. Just wait. Wait here. Malorie!

898
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:51,200
-等等 -奥林匹亚 你在干什么？
- I gotta pee. - Olympia, what are you doing?

899
01:05:51,290 --> 01:05:52,540
-马洛里！ -你在干什么？
- Malorie! - What are you doing?

900
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:56,410
-你怎么想的？趴下！ -他很害怕
- What are you thinking? Get down! - Okay, he's just scared.

901
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:58,450
-他很害怕 -检查他的包
- He's just scared. - Tom. Check the bag.

902
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:00,330
过来 奥林匹亚
Get over here, Olympia. Get over here.

903
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:02,750
-你是谁？ -这家伙是谁？
- Who are you? - Who is this guy?

904
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:05,080
汤姆 我看着他 检查他的包
Tom, I've got him. Check the bag. Check the bag.

905
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:07,040
-他是谁？ -他很害怕
- Who is this? - He's just scared.

906
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:08,580
-你是谁？ -他怎么进来的？
- Who are you? - How did he get in here?

907
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:12,200
-奥林匹亚 闭嘴 你是谁？ -他刚才很害怕 我就让他进来了
- Shut up, Olympia. Who are you? - He was scared, okay? I just let him in.

908
01:06:12,290 --> 01:06:14,660
-你让一个陌生人到房子里来？ -对不起
- You let a stranger in the house! - I'm sorry.

909
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:16,410
-他吓坏了！ -你是傻子吗？
- He was terrified! - Are you a simpleton?

910
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:18,950
天呐 求你了
Oh, God. Okay. Please.

911
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,410
我名叫加里
My name is Gary.

912
01:06:21,290 --> 01:06:22,410
我住在城里
I live in the city.

913
01:06:22,830 --> 01:06:25,660
这些东西来的时候 我和我同事坐了出城的第一班列车
When these things came, I got the first train out with some colleagues

914
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:27,250
我们以为这样就会安全
because we thought it would be safe.

915
01:06:29,830 --> 01:06:34,040
让我待在这里吧 拜托了 他们在找我
Please, please just let me stay here. They're after me.

916
01:06:34,410 --> 01:06:35,290
谁在找你？
Who's after you?

917
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:38,580
-我不信 他在说谎 -谁在找你？
- I don't believe it. He's lying. - Who's after you?

918
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:39,790
显然他在说谎
It's obvious he's lying.

919
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:41,370
-我发誓 -你为什么来这里？
- I swear. - Why are you here?

920
01:06:41,450 --> 01:06:45,410
我们藏到我同事卡尔家
We went to my colleague Carl's house to lay low.

921
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:49,250
原先一切都没事 后来他们闯了进来
Everything was fine until they broke in.

922
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:52,330
灵体不会闯进人家的
Creatures don't break into people's homes.

923
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:54,500
不 不是灵体 是这些疯子
No, not the creatures, these psychos.

924
01:06:56,370 --> 01:06:58,330
诺斯伍德的疯子
These psychos from Northwood.

925
01:06:58,410 --> 01:07:00,830
诺斯伍德？是哪里？
Northwood? I don't... Where is that?

926
01:07:00,910 --> 01:07:03,620
是一个精神病院 专门收容那些犯罪的精神病人
It's a mental institution for the criminally insane.

927
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,910
这下可好 他们有了放风通行证
Well, it's nice to know they have hall passes now.

928
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:08,580
然后呢？
And then what?

929
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:13,000
他们把我们带到外面 逼我们睁开眼睛
They took us outside and they forced our eyes open

930
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:15,450
于是我们不得不看那些灵体
so that we would have to look at the creatures.

931
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:17,870
什么？
What?

932
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:21,040
-你看了吗？ -没有
- Did you look? - No.

933
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:26,910
我朋友卡尔把他们其中的一个人 摔倒在地上
Somehow, my friend Carl managed to tackle one of these people to the ground

934
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,120
然后我们都跑了
and the rest of us made a run for it.

935
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:32,620
我不停地跑 直到跑到了这里
I just kept on running and running and running till I got here.

936
01:07:33,790 --> 01:07:37,370
我敲了每家每户的门 但没人开门
I've been knocking on all the doors and nobody answered.

937
01:07:38,950 --> 01:07:40,950
最后你们开了门 所以…
Until you did, so...

938
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:43,660
谢谢你们
Thank you.

939
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:55,410
小鸟
Birds.

940
01:07:56,660 --> 01:08:01,500
最可怕的是 当这些人闯进来的时候
The scariest thing was, uh... when these people broke in, they...

941
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,830
他们没有戴着眼罩
they weren't wearing blindfolds.

942
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:09,080
好像他们不需要
It's like they didn't need them.

943
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:11,080
如果它们在外面 你一定要戴眼罩
But they'd been outside. You have to wear blindfolds.

944
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:12,750
这些人不用
Not these people.

945
01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:16,830
这些疯子不会像其他人一样受到影响
These crazy guys weren't affected like everyone else.

946
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:18,450
他们想看
They wanted to see.

947
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,040
他们很开心
They were happy.

948
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:23,450
他们可开心了
They were so glad.

949
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:28,500
他们说所有人都必需看到
And they said everyone needed to see.

950
01:08:33,290 --> 01:08:34,450
等等
Wait.

951
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:37,330
起来 出去 这里不是孤儿院
Get up and get out. It's not an orphanage.

952
01:08:37,410 --> 01:08:41,910
新来的 你来参观过了 我们很高兴认识你 现在滚吧
New guy, you had a great visit. We really loved meeting you. Now fuck off.

953
01:08:42,370 --> 01:08:46,330
谁不同意 就和他一起走
And anybody who doesn't agree, you go with him.

954
01:08:46,410 --> 01:08:48,580
-快点出去！ -道格拉斯 你这是谋杀
- Out now! - Douglas, that is murder.

955
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:50,080
不 这才是谋杀
No. This is murder.

956
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:53,040
-求你了 -让陌生人进屋
- Please. - Letting strangers into this house.

957
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:58,580
我们每次与外界接触 都带给了我们死亡
Every contact we have had with the outside has brought us death.

958
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:00,580
莉迪亚 格雷戈 查理
Lydia, Greg, Charlie.

959
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:02,580
你要是想救外面的人
If you wanna save people out there,

960
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:05,540
你就出了那扇门去救
then you go right through that door and you go do it.

961
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:08,370
我们不能再让更多陌生人进屋了
We're not bringing any more strangers in here.

962
01:09:08,830 --> 01:09:10,250
只要我活着 就不行
Not while I'm alive.

963
01:09:10,330 --> 01:09:13,160
我说最后一遍 站起来 出…
I won't tell you again, get up and get--

964
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:22,790
谢谢你
Thank you.

965
01:09:23,870 --> 01:09:25,580
你睡车库
You'll sleep in the garage.

966
01:09:35,330 --> 01:09:37,120
我开门的唯一原因是
The only reason I opened that door

967
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,870
我记得在那扇门外是什么感受
is 'cause I remember what it felt like to be outside of it.

968
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:43,160
要是你们没让我进来
If you guys hadn't let me in, I...

969
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:46,160
我感觉自己真是个累赘
I feel like such a burden.

970
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:48,790
你不会比我更是个累赘 好吗？
You are no more a burden than I am, okay?

971
01:09:48,870 --> 01:09:50,450
-不是那样的 -是的
- That's not true. - It is. It is.

972
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:52,040
你不像我那么软弱
You're not soft like me.

973
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:55,580
我被宠坏了
I'm so spoiled.

974
01:09:56,450 --> 01:10:00,700
我父母什么事都为我做 之后又有我丈夫宠我
My parents have always done everything for me and then my husband,

975
01:10:00,790 --> 01:10:04,160
我被这些爱变软弱了
and I just... I got soft from all that love.

976
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:08,450
我是被一群狼养大的 你应该感到幸运才对
Well, I was raised by wolves, so consider yourself lucky.

977
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:17,250
如果我遭遇不幸 我想你照顾我的孩子
If something happens to me, I want you to take care of my baby.

978
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:19,040
行吗？
Okay?

979
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:20,790
-不 -求你了
- No. No. - Please.

980
01:10:20,870 --> 01:10:22,160
-这是你的孩子 -马洛里
- It's your baby. - Malorie.

981
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:23,120
不
No.

982
01:10:23,580 --> 01:10:25,790
-答应我 -你不会有事的
- Promise me. - Nothing is gonna happen to you.

983
01:10:25,870 --> 01:10:26,750
这是你的孩子
It's your baby.

984
01:10:26,830 --> 01:10:27,750
-答应我 -你不会…
- Promise me. - Nothing--

985
01:10:27,830 --> 01:10:29,250
求你了 答应我
Please promise me.

986
01:10:31,950 --> 01:10:34,120
嗯 好 当然
Yeah, okay. Yeah, of course.

987
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:43,040
这是什么？
What is this?

988
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:45,790
要是我打算告诉你
Well, if I was just gonna tell you,

989
01:10:45,870 --> 01:10:49,750
我就不会包装的这么好了
I wouldn't have bothered putting it in this fancy-- this fancy bag.

990
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,660
我在拿食物用品的时候拿到的
I got it on the supply run.

991
01:11:00,870 --> 01:11:01,830
好可爱
- It's so cute. - Mm-hmm.

992
01:11:04,410 --> 01:11:05,790
-谢谢你 -不客气
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

993
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:13,330
我知道这不是你理想中的迎婴洗礼
I know it's not the baby shower you've always dreamt of.

994
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:15,950
我非常喜欢
No, it's-- It's perfect.

995
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:20,500
等你宝宝长大了 你可以送给她 好吗？
And you can give it to your little one when she's old enough, okay?

996
01:11:23,790 --> 01:11:24,790
谢谢
Thank you.

997
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:39,370
（在河上已三十八小时）

998
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:44,910
河流加速了 我们现在开会
You guys, the river's speeding up. It's time for a meeting.

999
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:01,290
我要和你们讲关于急流的事
I need to talk to you about the rapids.

1000
01:12:02,540 --> 01:12:04,870
我们进入急流时 河水会非常颠簸
The rapids are where the water gets very bumpy.

1001
01:12:04,950 --> 01:12:08,160
声音会很响 非常危险
It's very loud. It's very dangerous,

1002
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:10,910
这将会是我们最艰难的经历
and it's gonna be the hardest thing we have ever done.

1003
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:17,330
当我们到达急流 你们其中一个人要做一件很重要的事
And when we reach them, one of you is gonna have a very important job.

1004
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,040
你们其中一个人要看
One of you is gonna have to look.

1005
01:12:24,370 --> 01:12:27,370
看的那个人
And the person who looks,

1006
01:12:28,450 --> 01:12:31,330
要告诉我往哪个方向划
they have to tell me which direction to steer into

1007
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:33,040
这样我才不会出错
so that I go the right way.

1008
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:37,370
因为如果我看 我们都到不了
Because if I look, we won't make it.

1009
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:42,790
要是我们看到什么怎么办？
What if we see something?

1010
01:12:43,790 --> 01:12:45,500
-我来 -不
- I'll do it. - No, no, no, no.

1011
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:47,450
我说谁看
I'm-- I'm the one who will say who looks, okay? I say it.

1012
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:48,830
明白吗？由我来说

1013
01:12:49,410 --> 01:12:51,870
我说谁去 我说谁看
I'll say who goes. I'll say who looks.

1014
01:12:52,370 --> 01:12:53,620
我说谁看
I say who looks.

1015
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:05,500
∮ To live without you ∮

1016
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:08,660
∮ Would only be heartbreak for me ∮

1017
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:20,040
∮ I say a little prayer for you ∮

1018
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:24,910
测试信号 有人在吗？

01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,120
∮ Forever and ever You'll stay in my heart ∮

1022
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:36,370
-我很爱这首歌 -我也是

1023
01:13:36,450 --> 01:13:37,700
-我也是 -我也是

1024
01:13:38,910 --> 01:13:40,870
我从来没听过
- I've never actually heard it before. - Hmm.

1025
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:43,330
∮ Together forever That's how must be ∮

1026
01:13:43,410 --> 01:13:46,950
∮ To live without you Would only be heartbreak for me... ∮

1027
01:13:54,580 --> 01:13:57,290
-或许是虚惊一场呢？ -没事
- It could be a false alarm, right? - All right.

1028
01:13:57,370 --> 01:13:58,870
我们到楼上卧室里去
We're going upstairs to the bedroom.

1029
01:13:58,950 --> 01:14:03,160
我们需要毛巾、海绵、剪刀 还有很多水
We need towels, sponges, um... scissors, and lots of water.

1030
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:06,660

Ah, the scissors are in the, um, drawer by the side of your left hand. Yeah.

-天呐 奥林匹亚 遮住你的眼睛 -是不是很美？
- Olympia, cover your eyes. - Isn't it beautiful?

1086
01:20:12,790 --> 01:20:16,040
不 你为什么这样做？加里 别这样
No. Why are you doing this? Gary, please don't do this.

- Show the baby. - No, no, no, Olympia.

1089
01:20:21,450 --> 01:20:23,120
奥林匹亚 遮住孩子的眼睛
Olympia, cover the baby's eyes.

1090
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:24,330
奥林匹亚

- You're not so bad. - Olympia, let me see your baby.

遮住孩子的眼睛 让我看你孩子 就一会儿
Keep the baby's eyes covered. Let me see your baby, just for one minute.

1095
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:41,250
奥林匹亚 让我抱你孩子 就一会儿！

1096
01:20:41,330 --> 01:20:42,290

Just one minute.

1097
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:44,580
让我抱一会儿 好吗？
Let me hold her for one minute, okay?

1098
01:20:44,950 --> 01:20:46,250
-就一会儿 -看

1103
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:38,830
嘿 马洛里
Hey, Malorie.

1104

Give me the children.

1105
01:21:43,910 --> 01:21:45,330
把孩子们给我
Give me the kids.

1106
01:21:46,660 --> 01:21:48,660
把孩子们给我 不然我就抢了
Give me the children or I'll take them!

1107
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:50,620
嘿 混蛋
Hey, asshole.

1108
01:21:51,370 --> 01:21:52,290
嘿
Hey.

1109
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:55,160
你在这里干什么？
What are you doing here?

1110
01:21:59,290 --> 01:22:00,370
你是来看的吗？
Have you come to see?

1111
01:22:02,540 --> 01:22:03,660
睁开你的眼睛
Open your eyes.

1112
01:22:07,910 --> 01:22:09,330
别害怕
Don't be frightened.

1113
01:22:10,910 --> 01:22:12,410
看着我
Look at me. Look at me.

1114
01:22:12,790 --> 01:22:14,500
看着我！
Look at me. Look at me!

1115
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:22,160
Ow.

1116
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:49,750
对不起
I'm sorry.

1117
01:22:53,370 --> 01:22:55,660
对不起 你没能看到
I'm sorry that you didn't get to see.

1118
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,580
它真的很美
It is beautiful.

1119
01:22:59,410 --> 01:23:01,000
太美了
So beautiful.

1120
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,250
对不起
I'm sorry.

1121
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:11,700
它将净化这个世界
It shall cleanse the world.

1122
01:23:56,750 --> 01:24:02,450
求你了 别伤害我们 别靠近我们
Please don't. Please don't hurt us. Please stay away from us.

1123
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,450
求你了 求你了
Please. Please. Please. Please.

1124
01:24:02,540 --> 01:24:05,330
不要这样做
Please don't do this. Don't do this. Please don't do this.

1125
01:24:09,290 --> 01:24:11,620
没事了
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1126
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:38,080
（五年后）

1127
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:39,290
仔细听喀哒声
Listen to the clicks.

1128
01:24:40,370 --> 01:24:43,620
听这声音 是更轻还是更响
Listen to the sounds, if they're softer or louder.

1129
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:45,950
听这个
Listen to this.

1130
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:48,160
听
Listen.

1131
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:51,700
当声音更响时 你们就在一个 宽阔的空间 听到了吗？
If they're louder, you're in an open space. Do you hear that?

1132
01:24:51,790 --> 01:24:55,000
如果声音更轻的话 代表着周围有东西
But if they're softer, something is very close.

1133
01:24:55,290 --> 01:24:57,450
喂 有人吗？
Please. Anyone. Hello? Hello?

1134
01:24:58,250 --> 01:24:59,540
喂
Hello, hel--

1135
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:03,910
喂
Hello?

1136
01:25:53,830 --> 01:25:55,370
看这个。 是的
Check it out. Yeah.

1137
01:25:57,330 --> 01:25:59,290
这里什么都没有
There is nothing here.

1138
01:25:59,870 --> 01:26:02,500
-去另一个地方吧。- 浪费时间
- Let's go to another spot. - Fucking time.

1139
01:26:26,790 --> 01:26:27,620
嘿
- Hey.

1140
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:28,910
嘿
- Hey.

1141
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:53,700
怎么了？
What's wrong?

1142
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:57,200
我又听到那些人了
I heard some of them again.

1143
01:26:58,500 --> 01:26:59,450
什么？
What?

1144
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:01,790
有几个人
A few of 'em...

1145
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:03,620
在开车
driving around.

1146
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:07,830
从开车的方式看 好像他们没有戴眼罩
Driving around like they're not blindfolded.

1147
01:27:09,870 --> 01:27:10,830
好吧
Okay.

1148
01:27:12,580 --> 01:27:13,790
那就不要再一个人出去
No more runs alone.

1149
01:27:15,580 --> 01:27:16,540
好
Okay.

1150
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:23,660
这是什么？
What's this?

1151
01:27:24,250 --> 01:27:26,700
我想给孩子们一个警报系统
I was thinking like a warning system for the kids.

1152
01:27:26,790 --> 01:27:28,290
如果他们遇到麻烦 就摇铃
- If they're in trouble, ring the bell.

1153
01:27:28,370 --> 01:27:30,950
嗯 不错
- Right. That's nice.

1154
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:38,040
那这个呢？
How about this?

1155
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:39,950
哦 这是…
Oh, it's...

1156
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:42,040
纯粹为了生存着想
It's purely survival.

1157
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:43,870
-纯粹为了生存？ -没错
- Purely survival? - Yeah.

1158
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:23,080
喂
Hello?

1159
01:28:23,950 --> 01:28:24,830
喂
Hello?

1160
01:28:25,660 --> 01:28:27,620
有人在吗？喂
Is anyone there? Hello?

1161
01:28:29,750 --> 01:28:30,870
测试信号
Testing. Testing.

1162
01:28:30,950 --> 01:28:33,910
有人在的话 请回话
If there is anyone there, please respond.

1163
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,620
-喂 -喂
- Hello? - Hello.

1164
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:36,750
你是谁？
Who is this?

1165
01:28:37,370 --> 01:28:39,040
-我名叫瑞克 -不
My name is Rick.

1166
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:40,620
你是谁？
Who is this?

1167
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:44,370
瑞克 我是汤姆
Rick, this is Tom.

1168
01:28:44,450 --> 01:28:45,790
我们有一个地方
We have a place.

1169
01:28:45,870 --> 01:28:48,410
一个营地 有足够的供给…
A compound with enough supplies--

1170
01:28:49,910 --> 01:28:50,910
我们有一个社区
We have a community.

1171
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:53,620
这里很安全
It's safe here.

1172
01:28:54,410 --> 01:28:56,330
我们在河的最下游
We're down by the river's end.

1173
01:28:56,750 --> 01:28:58,450
-你在哪儿？ -别回答他
- Where are you? - Don't answer that.

1174
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:01,540
派克采石场附近
Near Pike's Quarry.

1175
01:29:01,910 --> 01:29:05,660
天呐 你们好远 你们有几个人？
Jesus. You're a ways away. How many of you are there?

1176
01:29:06,580 --> 01:29:07,660
四个
- Four of us. - Hmm-mm.

1177
01:29:08,410 --> 01:29:09,950
其中有小孩吗？
Are any of them children?

1178
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:12,580
-什么都别说 -没事的
- Don't, do not say anything. - It's okay. It's okay.

1179
01:29:13,750 --> 01:29:16,120
没有 怎么了？
No. Why?

1180
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,620
因为沿着河过来是到这里最快的方式
Because the fastest way to get here is by the river,

1181
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:22,410
恐怕你带着小孩来不了
and I don't think you could make it with kids.

1182
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:24,700
等等 沿着河？
Wait, the river?

1183
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:27,040
向下游一直漂
Float downstream as far as you can.

1184
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:29,290
直到你们到达急流
Stay on the water until you hit the rapids.

1185
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:32,580
那里水流湍急 非常危险
The water is fast there. It's dangerous.

1186
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:34,410
我们有几个人丢了性命
We've lost some people.

1187
01:29:35,290 --> 01:29:37,200
你们得看清楚
You need to see clearly.

1188
01:29:37,450 --> 01:29:39,500
-什么意思？ -你说看清楚是什么意思？
- What does that mean? - What do you mean, see clearly?

1189
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:43,290
你们得看
You will have to look.

1190
01:29:45,290 --> 01:29:48,080
瑞克 我们都戴着眼罩 我们看不了
- I'm telling you. - Rick, we'll have blindfolds on.

1191
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:49,700
你这样说我就放心了
We can't look.

1192
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:50,040
I'm glad you said that.

1193
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:51,870
其中一定要有一个人…
Someone will have to take a--

1194
01:29:53,410 --> 01:29:57,330
按流速计算 你们要准备好大概两天的旅程
Prepare for two days' journey at the pace of the river's current.

1195
01:29:57,580 --> 01:29:59,160
带超过两天需要的补给
Bring supplies for longer.

1196
01:29:59,620 --> 01:30:01,700
急流过后怎么找你呢？瑞克
How do I find you after the rapids, Rick?

1197
01:30:01,950 --> 01:30:03,200
你们会听见鸟声
You'll hear the birds.

1198
01:30:03,870 --> 01:30:07,040
我们有很多鸟 跟着声音走
We've got a lot of them. Just follow the sound to us.

1199
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:10,500
顺着河边小道 你们会碰到一面墙 墙上有一扇门
Down a small embankment, you'll find a wall with a gate.

1200
01:30:10,580 --> 01:30:11,660
那是我们的…
That's our--

1201
01:30:13,870 --> 01:30:15,330
-他们的什么？ -我们的什么？
- That's their what? - That's our what?

1202
01:30:16,290 --> 01:30:17,160
瑞克？
Rick?

1203
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:19,540
瑞克？
Rick?

1204
01:30:30,830 --> 01:30:31,750
有可能是真的
It could be real.

1205
01:30:31,830 --> 01:30:32,830
-不 -或许是事实
- No. - Could be the truth.

1206
01:30:32,910 --> 01:30:35,120
-“或许”还不够 -万一瑞克能帮我呢？
- Could be is not good enough. - What if Rick could help us?

1207
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:36,830
万一瑞克和那帮人是一伙的呢？
And what if Rick is one of them?

1208
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:40,290
但他知道鸟的事
Huh? Wait, he knew about the birds.

1209
01:30:40,950 --> 01:30:43,700
天呐 加里也知道鸟的事 他把鸟放进冰柜
Oh, my God. Gary knew about the birds and he put them in the freezer.

1210
01:30:43,790 --> 01:30:46,000
我不敢相信你真的在考虑这件事
I cannot believe you're actually thinking about this.

1211
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:47,950
每家房子都没食物了 我们得走了
Every house has run out of food. We have to move.

1212
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:51,200
你真的以为我不知道吗？
You really don't think I know that? You don't think I know that?

1213
01:30:56,750 --> 01:30:59,120
我小时候 我们家有条像这样的船
When I was little, we had a boat just like this.

1214
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:01,950
每年夏天 我们会把船拉到湖上
And every single summer, we would take it to the lake.

1215
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:03,000
每年夏天都会
Every summer.

1216
01:31:03,410 --> 01:31:07,000
你们一定会很喜欢那里的 那里有树 有花
You guys would have loved it up there. They had trees. They had flowers.

1217
01:31:07,540 --> 01:31:10,080
湖水很暖和 天上飘着云
The water was warm, the clouds were in the sky.

1218
01:31:11,290 --> 01:31:14,120
所有孩子都在水里玩
We'd all play in the water. All the kids, all the children.

1219
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:16,200
我们都会在水里与岸上来回跑
We would all just run up and down the shore.

1220
01:31:16,290 --> 01:31:18,250
世界上有别的孩子吗？
There were other children in the world?

1221
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,500
有啊 就像你们一样
Yeah, just like you. Just like you.

1222
01:31:21,580 --> 01:31:23,000
像你们一样
Like you.

1223
01:31:23,830 --> 01:31:26,540
有一天我们看到了一棵巨大的橡树
One day, we saw this really, really big oak tree.

1224
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,540
比这个房子还要大
It was bigger than this house.

1225
01:31:28,620 --> 01:31:31,080
大到我们连树顶都看不到
It was so big and old, I couldn't see the top of it.

1226
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:32,580
-猜我们做了什么？ -爬了树
- Guess what we did? - Climbed it.

1227
01:31:32,660 --> 01:31:34,290
没错 我们爬了上去
We climbed it. Yes, we climbed it.

1228
01:31:34,370 --> 01:31:36,750
我们不断地爬 一直爬到树顶
We climbed it and climbed it until we got to the top.

1229
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:39,290
猜我们爬到树顶后看到了什么？
Guess what we saw when we got to the top?

1230
01:31:39,370 --> 01:31:40,870
男孩！女孩！该睡觉了
Boy! Girl! Time for bed.

1231
01:31:40,950 --> 01:31:42,500
但汤姆在讲故事
But Tom's telling a story.

1232
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:45,620
-就让我…快讲完了 -我不说第二遍 走了
- Mal, let me just-- We're almost done. - I'm not gonna say it again. Come on.

1233
01:31:48,540 --> 01:31:49,540
女孩 走了
Girl, come on.

1234
01:31:50,950 --> 01:31:52,080
快点
Right now.

1235
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:53,120
走了
Come on.

1236
01:31:53,950 --> 01:31:55,410
快点
Right now.

1237
01:31:56,370 --> 01:31:57,250
上床！
Bed!

1238
01:32:00,910 --> 01:32:02,790
-你在干什么？ -你在干什么？
- What are you doing? - What are you doing?

1239
01:32:02,870 --> 01:32:05,950
现在他们就会以为 他们会和别的孩子去爬树
Now they think they're gonna go outside and climb trees with all these new kids

1240
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:08,040
-看花草 看蝴蝶！ -这只是个故事
- and see butterflies and flowers! - It's a story.

1241
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:10,080
这不是故事 这是个谎言
It's not a story. It's a lie.

1242
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:13,000
因为他们永远不会爬树 他们永远不会交新朋友
Because they'll never climb trees, they are never gonna make new friends.

1243
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:15,790
-为什么要他们相信这些？ -他们总得相信些什么
- Why make them believe that? - They have to believe in something.

1244
01:32:15,870 --> 01:32:17,580
要是他们什么都不信 做这些有什么意义？
What is this for if they don't have anything to believe in?

1245
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,410
-为了他们能生存 -生存并不是生活
- So that they survive! - Surviving is not living.

1246
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:22,910
听你的 他们会死的！
They're gonna die if they listen to you!

1247
01:32:25,250 --> 01:32:27,330
生活不仅是生活本身 更是它蕴含的可能性
Life is more than just what is. It's what could be.

1248
01:32:27,410 --> 01:32:28,330
你能把它变成什么
What you could make it.

1249
01:32:28,410 --> 01:32:30,910
就算你知道不可能实现 你也要给他们梦想
You need to promise them dreams that may never come true.

1250
01:32:31,450 --> 01:32:34,790
你明知道随时可能失去他们 但你会一样地去爱他们
You need to love them knowing that you may lose them at any second.

1251
01:32:34,870 --> 01:32:38,370
他们值得拥有梦想、爱和希望 他们值得拥有一个母亲
They deserve dreams. They deserve love. They deserve hope. They deserve a mother.

1252
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:41,370
他们值得拥有一个母亲
They deserve a mother.

1253
01:32:41,870 --> 01:32:44,370
你还没给他们取名 马洛里 他们还是叫男孩、女孩
You haven't given them names, Mal. Their names are Boy and Girl!

1254
01:32:44,830 --> 01:32:45,750
想想吧
Think about that.

1255
01:32:45,830 --> 01:32:48,370
我做的每一个决定都是为了他们
Every single decision I have made has been for them.

1256
01:32:48,450 --> 01:32:50,620
每一个决定
Every single one.

1257
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:12,000
你知道我看到了什么吗？
You know what I saw?

1258
01:33:14,290 --> 01:33:15,910
在树顶上？
At the top of the tree?

1259
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:19,040
我看到一个鸟窝
I saw a nest.

1260
01:33:21,620 --> 01:33:22,950
有五只鸟
With five birds.

1261
01:33:23,950 --> 01:33:26,000
在最顶端的树枝上
Sitting on the top branch.

1262
01:33:30,830 --> 01:33:32,370
然后它们都飞走了
And then they just flew away.

1263
01:33:58,120 --> 01:34:00,330
好 坐下！
Got it. Got it. Sit. Sit!

1264
01:34:29,790 --> 01:34:31,160
这里安全 进来吧
It's safe. Come in.

1265
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:06,000
哇
Wow.

1266
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:07,580
真的吗？
No, you did not.

1267
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:11,370
-估计变质了 -是啊
- They're probably stale. - Yeah.

1268
01:35:12,330 --> 01:35:13,410
过来
Come here.

1269
01:35:14,660 --> 01:35:15,910
我就喜欢这样的
Just how I like 'em.

1270
01:35:17,080 --> 01:35:18,080
对不起
I'm sorry.

1271
01:35:20,410 --> 01:35:22,250
-抱歉 -我也是
- Sorry. - Me too.

1272
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:25,950
过来
Come here.

1273
01:35:42,370 --> 01:35:43,580
孩子们
Kids.

1274
01:35:47,750 --> 01:35:49,160
这是草莓
This is strawberry.

1275
01:35:49,580 --> 01:35:51,620
草莓就是这个味道的
This is what strawberry tastes like.

1276
01:36:07,580 --> 01:36:09,330
-那是什么？ -安静
- What's that? - Quiet.

1277
01:36:14,660 --> 01:36:15,700
嘘
Shh.

1278
01:36:17,660 --> 01:36:18,700
有人在家吗？
Anybody home?

1279
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:23,410
带孩子们从后门走 我引开他们
Take the kids out the back. I'll distract them.

1280
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:26,450
如果我过15分钟还不回家的话 你就带着孩子们坐船走
If I'm not home in 15 minutes, you take the kids to the boat and you go.

1281
01:36:26,540 --> 01:36:28,120
-我不会离开你！ -马洛里
- I'm not leaving you! - Mal.

1282
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:30,370
-不 我不会离开你 -听我说

1283

I love you so much.

1284

1286

保重 快走
Be good. Go.

1287
01:36:40,620 --> 01:36:41,450

1289
01:36:44,790 --> 01:36:47,450
-你好 朋友 -有什么要帮忙的吗？
- Hey there, friend. - Can I help you?

1290
01:36:49,250 --> 01:36:50,700
不用了 朋友
I don't think so, friend.

1291
01:36:50,790 --> 01:36:52,120
但我们可以帮你
We can help you though.

1292
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:53,660
不 离开！
No. Go!

1293
01:36:54,290 --> 01:36:56,410
-把眼罩摘下 -退后
- Take off your blindfold. - Stand back.

1294
01:36:56,500 --> 01:36:58,450
-退后！ -她不会动的

1295
01:37:03,700 --> 01:37:05,540
哎 这里有个女的带着两个孩子
Hey. Got a woman and two kids over here.

1296
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:20,910
它们要来了
They're coming.

1297
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,250
它们不会伤害你的
They won't hurt you.

1298
01:37:23,330 --> 01:37:25,040
豁出去了
Fuck it. Fuck it.

1299
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:27,410
相反
On the contrary...

1300
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:31,040
它是很美丽的 朋友
it's a beautiful thing, friend.

1301
01:39:53,410 --> 01:39:56,830
听好了 我只说一遍
Listen to me. I'm only gonna say this once.

1302
01:39:56,910 --> 01:39:59,700
我们要起程了 这次旅程会很艰苦
We are going on the trip now. It's going to be rough.

1303
01:39:59,790 --> 01:40:04,450
你们必须严格按照我说的去做 不然我们到不了
You have to do every single thing I say or we will not make it.

1304
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:05,700
明白吗？
Understand?

1305
01:40:06,910 --> 01:40:08,080
汤姆呢？
Where's Tom?

1306
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:10,290
他不来了
He's not coming.

1307
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:22,120
（在河上已四十二小时）

1308
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:30,750
是时候了
It's time. It's time. It's time.

1309
01:40:44,450 --> 01:40:45,620
记得急流吗？
You remember the rapids?

1310
01:40:46,700 --> 01:40:48,700
还记得我说的急流吗？
Remember I told you about the rapids?

1311
01:40:50,250 --> 01:40:51,200
我们离它很近了
Well, they're close.

1312
01:40:51,290 --> 01:40:56,540
急流非常危险 我们想要渡过只有一个办法
It is very dangerous and there's only one way for me to navigate through them.

1313
01:40:57,540 --> 01:40:58,620
必须有人得看
Somebody has to look.

1314
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:01,580
-我来看 -不 我会决定！明白吗？
- I'll look. - No. I will decide! Okay? I will decide.

1315
01:41:01,660 --> 01:41:03,540
让我想一下
Just give me-- Just give me a second.

1316
01:41:11,370 --> 01:41:12,250
我看
I'll do it.

1317
01:41:41,910 --> 01:41:43,500
我非常爱你
I love you so much.

1318
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:54,620
谁也不看
Nobody's looking.

1319
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,040
好吗？我们谁也不看
Okay, nobody's looking.

1320
01:41:58,250 --> 01:41:59,250
好吗？
Okay?

1321
01:42:09,790 --> 01:42:11,330
我们把眼睛蒙上
Do your eyes. Let's do eyes.

1322
01:42:17,790 --> 01:42:20,910
跪下来 趴下来 抓紧了
Come on. Get on your knees. Stay down low. Hold on tight.

1323

我们要往那个方向去 跟着声音走
That's where we're headed. We just follow that sound.

1349
01:44:54,700 --> 01:44:55,790

- Malorie, look at me. - It's not real. It's not real.

1358
01:45:53,120 --> 01:45:55,700
这不是真的 这不是真的
It's not real. It's not real. it's not real.
