从某个市场上偷来的
Stole it from a market.

63

真不错
It's quite a piece.

64

是谁做的

街头艺人
...market artist.

67

68
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,710
成交
Deal.

69

我可没有把柄在你手上 公主殿下
You've got nothing on me, princess.

76
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,720
不然我就告诉她你在看乱交色情片
Or I'll tell her you were watching gang bangs.

77
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,960
拜托不要再这样做了
Please don't do that again.

I wasn't, by the way.

我自己带着的
I brought it with me.

82

不 才不是呢 还回来
No, you didn't. Give it back.

83
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,830

Tight.

84
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,230
和哈里和好了吗
Patch things up with Harry?

85
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,110
是啊 我们 呃
Yeah, we're, erm...

86
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,510
我们订婚了 所以
We're engaged, so...

87
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,670
老天 什么
God! What?

88
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,270
不 我们没有订婚
No, we're not engaged!

89
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,470
不 他又回公寓打包他的行李了
No, he's back at the flat packing up all his stuff again.

90
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,270
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

91
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,510
他以前
He really...

92
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,510
真的能让你开心
...used to make you laugh.

93
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,790
他以前也说过这样的话
He also used to say things like...

94
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,470
你不像其他女孩
You're not like other girls.

95
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,830
你能
You can...

96
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,880
跟上我的节奏
...keep up.

97
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,030
我挺喜欢哈里的
I like Harry.

98
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,360
我喜欢他的歌
I liked his songs.

99
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,400
我很欣赏哈里在我们分手时做出的贡献
I admire how much Harry commits to our break-ups.

100
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,870
我的意思是 这可是个新细节
I mean, this is a new detail,

101
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,830
但他通常的确会做得极端一点
but he does usually go the extra mile.

102
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,640
有几次 他甚至打扫了整个公寓
A few times, he's even cleaned the whole flat.

103
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,870
好像这公寓是个犯罪现场似的
Like it's a crime scene.

104
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,470
我在考虑是不是应该
I've considered timing a break-up

105
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,710
每当公寓需要打扫的时候计划一次分手
for when the flat needs a bit of a going over.

106
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,800
我觉得我们俩还是不合适
I don't think this is working.

107
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,470
什么
What?

108
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,480
但他总是会留下
But he always leaves...

109
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,790
他的东西
...him

110
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,390
作为再回来的理由
to come back for.

111
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,560
得想想现在能和我做爱的所有人了
Got to think about all the people I can have sex with now.

112
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,510
我可不是对性上瘾
I'm not obsessed with sex,

113
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,230
我只是没法停止想到它
I just can't stop thinking about it.

114
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,230
性的表现
The performance of it.

115
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,150
性的尴尬
The awkwardness of it.

116
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,230
性的戏剧化
The drama of it.

117
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,590
你意识到有人渴望你的身体
The moment you realise someone wants

118
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
的那个时刻
your body.

119
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,520
对性本身的感觉倒不是很多
Not so much the feeling of it.

120
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,040
在哈里回来之前 大概还有四十八小时的时间
Probably got about 48 hours before Harry comes back.

121
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,720
我应该准备一下了
I should get on it.

122
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,390
我花了半个小时想让自己看起来好看一点
I took half an hour trying to look nice

123
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,070
结果我看起来简直美呆了
and I ended up looking amazing.

124
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,390
就像那些以前的时光
Just one of those days.

125
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,110
美艳动人 青春无敌 崭新上衣 风骚微露
Gorgeous, fresh-faced, new top, little bit sexy,

126
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,790
走在去我咖啡店的路上 然后
on my way to open my cafe and...

127
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,430
噢 老天
Oh, God.

128
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,750
好吧 随便你怎么看我 小胖墩
Yeah, you check me out, chub-chub,

129
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,870
因为我们俩是没有可能的
because it's never gonna happen.

130
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,430
噢 天哪 他不敢相信我有多么吸引人
Oh, God, he can't believe how attractive I am.

131
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,460
有点担心
Kind of worried I'm going

132
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,230
我的美丽会让这个可怜的家伙犯罪
to make a sex offender out of the poor guy.

133
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,470
走你 最好有个好结果 走着
Here we go. This better be good. Here we go.

134
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,880
臭婊子
Hooker slag.

135
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,920
小心点
Oi!

136
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,520
不小心弄掉了我的黄瓜
Dropped my cucumber.

137
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,280
只是弄掉了我的
Just dropped my...

138
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,790
请给我一份芝士三明治 带走
Erm... Could I get a cheese sandwich to go, please?

139
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,840
好的
Sure.

140
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:49,190
总共 十二镑五十五便士
That'll be, er, 12.55, please.

141

I don't have to define myself by how I look

209
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,590
因为我拥有这么火辣的身材

219
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,510
我给你们介绍一下希拉里

220
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,040
两年前 我
Two years ago, I...

221
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,150
好吧 最重要的事情是 就算你不喜欢

-我们也没法把这个退回去了 好吗 -好

抱歉 我有点紧张
I'm sorry, I panicked.

225
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,750
只要我能穿上或者能吃掉 我就很开心
As long as I can wear it or eat it, I'm happy.

226
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,590
这两样你都能做到
You can do both of those things.

227
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,390
噢 天呐 你送了我一只
Oh, my God, did you get me a...

228

230

231
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,560
她太美了
She's beautiful!

232
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,990
你个傻瓜
You idiot!

00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,640
逃跑大师
Escape artist.

234
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,870
我对豚鼠并没有什么特殊感觉
I don't feel anything about guinea pigs,

235
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,110
它们毫无意义
they're pointless,

236
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,470
但是小波把作为礼物的希拉里很当一回事
but Boo took Hillary very seriously as a gift

237
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,800
然后 很快 所有事情都变成和豚鼠相关的了
and, soon, everything became guinea pig-related.

238
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,320
这张实在太棒了
This is an excellent one.

239

Drink?

240
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,470
我很抱歉房间有些乱
Look, I'm, er, sorry about the mess.

241
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,650
-没事 -想要点五香火腿肉来配酒吗
- No problem. - Do you want some prosciutto with that?

242
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,030
十分可靠
So reliable.

243
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,350
非常难以得手
Utterly inaccessible.

244
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,030
无情地深邃
Relentlessly profound.

245
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,070
他所想要的只是把你弄进浴缸 然后问一些这样的问题
All he wants is to get you in the bath and ask questions like...

246
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,400
你怕什么
What are you afraid of?

247
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,310
而你发现你自己在给出这样的回答
And you find yourself saying things like...

248
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,910
我猜
I guess...

249
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,800
青春的流逝
...losing the currency of youth.

250
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,560
问我一个问题
Ask me a question.

251
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,760
你是什么时候意识到自己长得这么好看的
When did you realise you were so good looking?

252
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,390
我差不多九岁的时候知道了我和别人不同
I knew I was different when I was about nine,

253
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,510
但在我十一岁的时候事情成真了
but shit got real around 11.

254
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,910
事情成真了
Shit got real?

255
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,470

阿姨婶婶们变得很奇怪
Aunts got weird.

257
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,630
我还有个问题
I have another question.

258
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,680
好
Ok.

259
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,240
你有感觉到孤独吗
Do you ever feel lonely?

260
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,390
有
Yeah.

261
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,190
当然
Of course.

262
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,190
你呢
Do you?

263
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,360
从来没有
Never.

264
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,480
你想来点菠萝吗
Do you want some pineapple?

265
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,040
当然
Yeah.

266
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,240
天啊 啊
God, yeah!

267
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,470
哦 它们好小啊
Oh, they're so small!

268
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,830
太小了
They are so small!

269
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,670
-什么 -它们好小
- What? - They're so small!

270
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,230
-太... -小
- So... - Small!

271
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,310
老天 太特么小了
God, they are so fucking tiny!

272
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,630
是啊 我想
Yeah, I guess they're...

273
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,590
哦 上帝 它们仿佛根本不存在
Oh, God, they're hardly even there!

274
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,590
我是说 这么小还算有吗
I mean, what the fuck even are they?

275
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,430
太过分了吧
Bit much.

276
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,840
抱歉
Excuse me!

277
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,120
哦 啊
Oh, yeah!

278
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,630
我想起哈里来了 有点恐怖
I'm having a Harry panic.

279
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,830
奥芙丽夫人告诉我 应该好好过日子
Madame Ovary's telling me to run back to safe place,

280
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,510
我可以结婚生子
I can make baby in safe place,

281
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,120
但是你得忍得住寂寞啊
but you've got to ride it out.

282
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,760
绝不能给哈里打电话
Mustn't call Ha...

283
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,160
谢谢你能来
Thanks for coming.

284

00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,560
你的短信看起来很着急
Your message sounded urgent.

287

你忙吗
Were you busy?

288
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,310
-不忙 我还在放通告期中间的小假期呢 -哦 太棒啦
- No, I was in the interval... - Oh, cool.

289
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,770
-《猫》 -很好
- ...of Cats. - OK.

290
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,630
-那个音乐剧 -很棒吗
- The musical. - Was it good?

291
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,070
真的很棒
Really good, actually.

292
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,120
很棒
Really good.

293
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,910
-抱歉打扰你了 -没有 没打扰
- Sorry for interrupting. - No, that's OK.

294
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,190
我 呃 我有感觉
I, er... I got the feeling

295
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,190
我在《猫》也没有什么前途
it wasn't going to end well for the cats,

296
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,000
所以最好还是先保留一些美好的记忆 别等到
so probably good to remember them like that before they all...

297
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,870
对不起 嗯
Sorry. Erm...

298
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,920
你还好吧
Are you OK?

299
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,670
你现在和谁在一起呢
Who were you with?

300
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,920
工作上认识的
A work friend.

301
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,640
一个女孩
A girl.

302
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,160
我 呃
I, erm...

303
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,720
我发现了这个
I found this.

304
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,150
谢谢
Thanks.

305
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,800
我还没注意我落下了
I didn't realise I'd left it.

306
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,480
为什么你的头发是湿的
Why's your hair wet?

307
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,110
别那样看着我
Don't look at me like that.

308
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,230
哪样 哪样
Like what? Like what?

309
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,510
听着 我不想做得那么冷血 或者是残忍 或者 你知道的
Look, I don't want to sound cold or cruel or... You know...

310
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,910
而且我也不想认为我总是在剧场里
And I don't want to think I'm just off happy at the theatre

311
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,270
也不开心 我没有
all the time, either, I'm not,

312
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,950
但是
but...

313
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,790
我不会再 我
I'm not going to... I just...

314
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,350
如果你又想复合的话 我讲真的
If this is about us getting back together, I was serious,

315
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,550
这次我不会再回头了
this time I'm not just going to come running back.

316
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,880
我真的得远离你一段时间
I really just need some time away from...

317
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,190
真高兴你打电话给我了
I'm so glad you called.

318
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,640
幸亏你接了
I'm so glad you picked up.

319
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,400
我想你了
I've missed you.

320
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,800
我想你了
I've missed you.

321
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,960
哦 上帝 你感觉真好
Oh, my gosh, you feel good.

322
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,830
我希望他只是上我就好了
I wish he'd just fuck me.

323
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,790
他却想和我做爱
All he wants to do is make love.

324
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,830
你好吗
Are you OK?

325
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,960
嗯 我很好 我感觉很棒
Yeah, I'm really good. I'm amazing.

326
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,390
他简直就在消磨我
He's wasting me.

327
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,470
有一次 那个男的每次进出都要呼吸一下
I was once fucking this guy who would breathe on every thrust...

328
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,750
你好年轻
You're so young!

329
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,950
你好年轻
You're so young!

330
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,790
我都靠那次意淫呢
I masturbate about that all the time.

331
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,430
最近我总在自己解决
I masturbate a lot these days.

332
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,040
尤其是我感觉无聊的时候
Especially when I'm bored.

333
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,670
或者生气的时候
Or angry.

334
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,830
或者心烦的时候
Or upset.

335
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,950
我们能不能
Can we just...

336
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,550
或者高兴的时候
Or happy.

337
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,950

339
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,480
太棒了
Amazing.

340
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,310
-我可以吗 -不 你就
- Shall I? - No, could you just...

341
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,670
别动了
Just stay there.

342
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,670
不 别 就
No, don't. Just...

343
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,510
啊 啊 啊

344
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,110

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,990
好的 就
Yes. Just...

346
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,590
啊
Ah, just...

347
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,720
啊 天哪
Ah, God.

348
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,160
听着 我觉得我们不要再手淫了
Look, I think we should stop masturbating.

349
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,030
先别着急反驳 我只是
And don't say anything yet, I just...

350
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,110
我只是觉得 我们如果更关注彼此 可能会更好
I just think it might help us focus on each other.

351
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,750
你懂的 参与度更高一点
You know, be more present.

352
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,760
成功的情侣都这样做
Really successful couples do it.

353
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,270
呃
Erm...

354
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,750
我把咱们的震动棒藏起来了
I've hidden our vibrators.

355
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,790
咱们的
Our?

356
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,230
我觉得应该会很有意思的
I thought it might be fun.

357
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,470
把他们找出来
To find them?

358
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,240
不是 就是尝试着不去
No, just to try and not...

359
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,630
爱抚自己 试着
...touch ourselves, to try and...

360
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,950
爱抚对方
...save our touches...

361
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,830
我是说 你觉得呢
...for each other. I mean, what do you think?

362
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,790
好吧 我觉得你太性感了
Well, I think you're being really sexy.

363
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,350
-不要 -哦 我开玩笑的

我从来不手淫
I never masturbate.

365
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,520
我压根不知道怎么手淫
I don't know how.

366
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,870
是啊 而且 我觉得我们应该试着给对方一些惊喜
Yeah, also, I thought we should try and surprise each other

367
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,030
每天一个惊喜 你知道的
once every day, just a, you know...

368
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,350
甜蜜的小惊喜什么的 来保持
A sweet little something, just to keep it...

369
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,630

Bit weird.

377
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,520

00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,750
是啊 我还好
Yeah, I'm fine.

381
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,470
你呢 你看起来压力很大
You OK? You look stressed.

382
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,840
嗯 我是成功人士啊 所以
Well, I'm successful, so...

383
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,230
有黑麦面包吗
Do you have rye bread?

384
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,990
没有 但是有普通面包 吃了之后你会再吐出来
No, but I have some normal bread you can puke up after.

385
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,790
太好了
Great.

386
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,070
夹什么
What do you want on it?

387
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,590
哦 西红柿就行
Oh, just tomatoes is fine.

388

西红柿三明治
Just a tomato sandwich?

390
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,270
是啊 有问题吗
Yes. Is there a problem?

391
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,560
没有
No.

392
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,150
听着 我不是想打听这个惊喜派对
Listen, I don't want to know anything about this surprise party,

393
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,110
但是 如果你能 呃
but, if you could just, erm,

394
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,270
周五七点半把它安排在我家 就再好不过了
have it at mine this Friday at 7:30, that'd be great.

395
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,830
我可以组织 然后表现得很惊喜
I can organise it and act surprised

396
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,910
但是 如果你能 呃
but, if you could just, erm...

397
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,910
你知道吗 要不我来办吧
Do you know what, why don't I just do it?

398
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,790
我可以举办聚会 做菜 然后表现出惊喜的样子
I can organise it, do the food, act surprised,

399
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,750
这样你就解脱了
and just take it off your hands.

400
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,390
我是说 我看的出来你很忙 所以
I mean, I can see that you're busy, so...

401
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:25,770
好吧 如果你愿意的话
OK, if you want.

402
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,750
嗯 也不是我愿意啦
Well, I don't want to,

403
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,630
但是 我觉得这样人人都轻松
but I think it would be easier for everyone

404
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,070
-如果我能 -好的
- if I could just... - OK.

408
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,750
你是欠了多少钱啊
How behind are you?

409
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,510
如果是钱的问题
If it's money that you need...

410
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,790
我不差钱
I don't need money.

That'll be 25 pounds, please.

412

415
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,790


416
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:01,800
