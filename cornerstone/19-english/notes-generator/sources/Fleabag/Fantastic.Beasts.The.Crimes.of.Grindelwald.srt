3
00:01:31,004 --> 00:01:33,799
我想你会很高兴摆脱他的
You'll be glad to be rid of him, I expect.

4
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,613
我们更希望的是就把他关在这里
We'd be more than happy to keep him here in custody.

5
00:01:36,614 --> 00:01:38,575
关六个月就够了
Six months are enough.

6
00:01:38,855 --> 00:01:41,563
现在是他对他在欧洲的罪行负责的时候了
It's time for him to answer for his crimes in Europe.

皮克雷主席  斯皮尔曼先生

8
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:47,483
已做好对囚犯的安全保护  可以出发了
Prisoner is secured and ready to travel.

9
00:01:53,225 --> 00:01:55,879
我能看出来  你把所有能用的东西都用在了他身上了
You've thrown everything at him, I see.

10
00:01:55,917 --> 00:01:58,650
这是必要的措施  他非常强大
It was necessary. He's extremely powerful.

11
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:05,015
我们已经给他换了三次警卫了  他似乎...很有影响力
We've had to change his guard three times, he's very... persuasive.

12
00:02:05,016 --> 00:02:06,963
所以我们切除了他的舌头
So we removed his tongue.

13

16

The wizarding community worldwide owes you a great debt, Madam President.

17
00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:38,554
别小看他
Do not underestimate him.

18
00:02:42,294 --> 00:02:45,937
斯皮尔曼先生  我们发现了他藏起来的法杖
Mr. Spielman, we found his wand hidden away.

19
00:02:49,347 --> 00:02:50,348
阿伯纳西

20
00:02:51,896 --> 00:02:53,514
我们还发现了这个
And we found this.

21
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,308
不再是那么能说会道了
No more silver tongue, hmm?

22
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,310
你已经加入了一个崇高的事业  我的朋友
You have joined a noble cause, my friend.

23
00:06:15,343 --> 00:06:19,079

莉塔…
Leta...

30
00:08:43,403 --> 00:08:44,778
你在这里做什么
What are you doing here?

31
00:08:45,034 --> 00:08:48,722
忒修斯认为如果我能成为魔法部的家人会很好
Theseus thought it would be good if I became part of the Ministry family.

32
00:08:49,356 --> 00:08:52,419
他真的说了"魔法部的家人"吗
Did he actually say the words “Ministry family?

33
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:53,967
听起来像我哥哥
That sounds like my brother

34
00:09:11,934 --> 00:09:14,822
忒修斯很失望你不能来吃晚饭
Theseus was disappointed you couldn't come to dinner.

35
00:09:15,326 --> 00:09:17,254
从来都不接受我们的晚饭邀请
Any of the nights we've asked you.

36
00:09:17,921 --> 00:09:19,622
嗯  我一直很忙
Well, I've been busy.

37
00:09:19,624 --> 00:09:20,875
他是你哥哥  纽特
He's your brother, Newt.

38
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:22,722
他喜欢和你在一起
He likes spending time with you.

39
00:09:23,407 --> 00:09:24,972
我也是
And so do I.

40
00:09:30,609 --> 00:09:32,635
喂  你   进去  皮克
Oi, you! Hop in, Pick.

41
00:09:34,522 --> 00:09:36,859
为什么古怪的生物那么喜欢你
Why do strange creatures love you so much?

42
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,317
-好吧,没有古怪的生物  -只有心胸狭隘的人
- Well, there are no strange creatures... - Only blinkered people!

43
00:09:43,615 --> 00:09:47,053
你因为对普伦德加斯特说这样的话而被扣留了多久
How long did you get in detention for saying that to Prendergast?

44
00:09:47,676 --> 00:09:49,682
你知道的  那段时间差不多有一个月吧
You know, I think it was a month that time.

45
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:54,432
我在他桌子下放了一枚粪便炸弹  这样我就能和你一起了  你还记得吗
And I set off a Dung bomb under his desk so I could join you, do you remember?

46
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,724
不  我真的不记得了
No, I actually don't remember that.

47
00:10:02,831 --> 00:10:03,831
你好
Hello.

48
00:10:04,365 --> 00:10:07,773
忒修斯  我们在说纽特要来我们家里吃晚饭
Theseus. We were just talking about Newt coming for dinner

49
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,130
真的   那么
Really? Well...

50
00:10:10,725 --> 00:10:12,575
听着  在我们进去之前我
Look, before we go in there I

51
00:10:12,577 --> 00:10:14,466
这是我第五次了  忒修斯  我知道形式的
It's my fifth attempt, Theseus. I know the form.

52
00:10:14,492 --> 00:10:16,804
这会不会像以前那样了  这会..
This isn't going to be like the other times. This is...

53
00:10:17,005 --> 00:10:19,897
只是试着尽量听取别人的意见  好吗
Just try and keep an open mind, will you?

54
00:10:20,878 --> 00:10:23,226
-就接受一下别那么  -太自我
- And maybe a little less. - Like me?

55
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:28,076
又没有坏处  快点  我们进去吧
Well, it can't hurt. Come on. Let's go.

56
00:10:35,186 --> 00:10:36,543
听证会开始了
Hearing commences...

57
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,643
你想结束你的国际旅行禁令  为什么
You want an end to the ban on your traveling internationally. Why?

58
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:45,375
因为我喜欢去国际旅行
Because I like to travel internationally.

59
00:10:45,401 --> 00:10:50,601
你对上一次国际旅行的原因采取不合作和回避的态度
Subject uncooperative and evasive on reasons for last international trip.

60
00:10:50,844 --> 00:10:52,268
那是一次实地考察
It was a field trip.

61
00:10:52,423 --> 00:10:55,356
我在那是为我那本关于神奇的动物的书收集素材
So I was collecting material for my book on magical beasts

62
00:10:55,758 --> 00:10:57,041
你差不多毁了半个纽约
You destroyed half of New York.

63
00:10:57,043 --> 00:10:59,476
不  实际上你说的这两点与事实非常不符
No, that's actually factually incorrect on two counts

64
00:10:59,478 --> 00:11:01,043
纽特
Newt!

65
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,690
斯卡曼德先生.
Mr. Scamander...

66
00:11:03,932 --> 00:11:08,556
很明显你很受挫  坦白说  我们也是
it's clear you're frustrated and, frankly, so are we.

67
00:11:10,528 --> 00:11:14,186
本着妥协的精神  我们想提出一个建议
In the spirit of compromise, we'd like to make a proposition.

68
00:11:14,322 --> 00:11:15,482
什么提议
What kind of proposition?

69
00:11:16,138 --> 00:11:19,754
委员会将同意在一定条件下解除你的旅行禁令
The committee will agree to lift your travel ban under one condition.

70
00:11:20,136 --> 00:11:21,783
你加入魔法部
You join the Ministry.

71
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:25,640
尤其是加入你哥哥的部门
Specifically, your brother's department.

72
00:11:28,942 --> 00:11:29,942
不
No.

73
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,490
我不喜欢的那样...
I-that isn't my kind of...

74
00:11:33,607 --> 00:11:35,272
忒修斯是傲罗
Theseus is the Auror...

75
00:11:35,711 --> 00:11:37,796
我想我还是把我的才能用到别处吧
I think my talents lie elsewhere.

76
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,952
斯卡曼德先生  法师和非法师
Mr. Scamander. The wizarding and non-wizarding

77
00:11:39,978 --> 00:11:42,246
已经在着世界上和平发展有一个多世纪了
worlds have been at peace for over a century.

78
00:11:43,192 --> 00:11:46,004
格林德沃希望看到和平被摧毁
Grindelwald wants to see that peace destroyed.

79
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:51,263
对我们群体的某些成员来说  他传达的信息非常有诱惑性
And for certain members of our community his message is very seductive.

80
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:56,979
很多纯正血统的法师认为这是他们与生俱来的统治权
Many pure-bloods believe it is their birthright to rule

81
00:11:57,004 --> 00:12:00,885
不仅是我们的世界  还有非魔法世界
not only our world but the non-magic world as well.

82
00:12:02,048 --> 00:12:04,434
他们视格林德沃为英雄
They see Grindelwald as their hero,

83
00:12:04,436 --> 00:12:07,916
而格林德沃却看到了这个男孩
and Grindelwald sees this boy

84
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,956
把他作为实现他目的一种手段
as a means to make this all come true.

85
00:12:12,823 --> 00:12:16,261
等等  你说的好像克雷登斯好像还存在一样
I'm sorry. You're talking about Credence as if he were still here.

86
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:18,405
他活下来了  纽特
He survived, Newt.

87
00:12:20,226 --> 00:12:21,696
他还活着
He is still alive.

88
00:12:22,553 --> 00:12:24,553
他几个月前离开了纽约
He left New York months ago.

89
00:12:24,741 --> 00:12:27,962
他在欧洲的某个地方  确切地说  我们也不知道在那  但是.
He's somewhere in Europe. Where exactly, we don't know, but...

90
00:12:27,964 --> 00:12:30,471
你想让我去找克雷登斯
And you want me to hunt Credence down?

91
00:12:31,272 --> 00:12:32,614
去杀他
To kill him?

92
00:12:32,697 --> 00:12:34,697
斯卡曼德还是老样子
Same old Scamander.

93
00:12:37,206 --> 00:12:38,756
他在这里做什么
What's he doing here?

94
00:12:39,054 --> 00:12:42,768
你太软弱了  不能胜任这份工作
Taking on the job you're too soft to do.

95
00:12:45,471 --> 00:12:47,145
就这样吗
Is that it?

96
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,908
旅行证件被拒绝
Travel documentation denied.

97
00:12:57,096 --> 00:12:58,096
纽特
Newt!

98
00:12:59,351 --> 00:13:01,600
你认为我比你更喜欢格里姆森这个主意吗
You think I like the idea of Grimmson any more than you do?

99
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:03,846
听着  忒修斯  我不想听你那些是非的教训话
Listen, I don't want to hear how the ends justify the means, Theseus.

100
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:05,307
我觉得是时候该把你的头抬起来了 看看现实了
I think you're gonna have to pull your head out of the sand!

101
00:13:05,331 --> 00:13:07,860
好吧  好吧  开始说吧  说我多么自私..不负责任..
Okay, right, here we go. What a selfish... irresponsible...

102
00:13:08,101 --> 00:13:10,717
你知道的  在现阶段每个人
You know, the time is coming when everyone's

103
00:13:10,743 --> 00:13:14,226
每个人都得选一边  即使是你
everyone's gonna have to pick a side. Even you.

104
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:16,857
我不做旁门左道的事
I don't do sides.

105
00:13:21,162 --> 00:13:22,162
纽特
Newt.

106

00:13:29,277 --> 00:13:30,277
来吧
C'mere.

108
00:13:37,811 --> 00:13:38,999
他们在监视你
They are watching you.

109
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,519
好吧  先生们
Well, gentlemen.

110
00:13:53,268 --> 00:13:56,229
我想这意味着我要接手这份工作了
I assume this means I have the job.

00:14:49,466 --> 00:14:50,716
谁在那儿
Who's there?

114
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:21,190
在彻底清洗之后  这将是很舒适的
This will be suitable after a thorough cleanse.

115
00:15:22,684 --> 00:15:24,958
我要你现在去马戏团
I want you to go to the circus now.

116
00:15:25,397 --> 00:15:27,468
把我的信交给克雷登斯
Give my note to Credence,

117
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:29,149
让他启程
begin his journey.

118
00:15:29,849 --> 00:15:32,706
一旦我们赢了  就会有数以百万计的人逃离城市
When we've won, they'll flee cities in the millions.

119
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,370
他们现在还有的是时间
They've had their time.

120
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:37,315
我们不会大声说出来的
We don't say such things out loud.

121
00:15:37,317 --> 00:15:39,083
我们只想要自由
We want only freedom.

122
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:41,488
属于我们的自由
Freedom to be ourselves.

123
00:15:41,613 --> 00:15:43,847
消灭非法师
To annihilate non-wizards.

124
00:15:43,873 --> 00:15:46,192
不是所有的人  不是全部
Not all of them. Not all.

125
00:15:46,852 --> 00:15:48,575
我们不是那么无情的
We're not merciless.

126
00:15:49,725 --> 00:15:53,004
留下一些驮畜永远是必要的
The beast of burden will always be necessary.

那么  就不能找个不那么显眼的屋顶吗
Were the less conspicuous rooftops full, then?

131
00:17:52,651 --> 00:17:55,512
我很喜欢看这里的风景
I do enjoy a view.

怎么样
How was it?

134
00:18:04,244 --> 00:18:06,836
他们仍然相信是你派我去纽约的
They're still convinced that you sent me to New York.

135
00:18:07,262 --> 00:18:09,034
你告诉他们我没有
You told them I didn't?

136
00:18:09,035 --> 00:18:10,035
对
Yes.

137
00:18:11,164 --> 00:18:13,542
但事实是你送我去
Even though you did.

138
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,245
你告诉我在哪能找到那只被贩卖的雷鸟
You told me where to find that trafficked Thunderbird,

139
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,211
邓布利多  你知道我会带他回家
Dumbledore. You knew that I would take him home and you

140
00:18:19,234 --> 00:18:20,766
而你知道我得带他穿过麻瓜港口
knew I'd have to take him through a Muggle port.

141
00:18:20,768 --> 00:18:23,501
嗯  我一直觉得自己和神奇的大鸟很亲近
Well, I've always felt an affinity with the great magical birds..

142
00:18:23,863 --> 00:18:25,901
我家里有个故事
There's a story in my family

143
00:18:25,903 --> 00:18:29,957
凤凰会来到任何一个邓布利多家族成员最需要的它地方
that a phoenix will come to any Dumbledore who is in desperate need.

144
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:34,930
他们说我的曾曾祖父有一个  但是当他死的时候它飞走了
They say my great-great grandfather had one, but that it took flight when he died,

145
00:18:35,373 --> 00:18:36,588
永不回头
never to return.

146
00:18:36,994 --> 00:18:39,886
恕我直言  我一刻也不相信
With all due respect, I don't believe for a minute

147
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:42,519
所以你才告诉我雷鸟的事
that's why you told me about the Thunderbird.

148
00:18:48,596 --> 00:18:50,814
克雷登斯在巴黎  纽特
Credence is in Paris, Newt.

149
00:18:51,558 --> 00:18:54,059
他想追踪他真正的家人
He's trying to trace his real family.

150
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,480
知道了
I take it.

151
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:56,837
你听过谣言
You've heard the rumors

152
00:18:56,863 --> 00:18:57,983
关于他到底是谁
about who he really is?

153
00:18:58,644 --> 00:18:59,858
没有
No.

154
00:19:07,042 --> 00:19:11,501
纯正血统的法师认为他是法国某个大家族的唯一后人
The pure-bloods think he's the last of an important French line,

155
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:16,100
一个被所有人认为丢失已久的孩子
a baby whom everyone thought lost

156
00:19:16,102 --> 00:19:19,485
-不是莉塔的兄弟吗   -他们就是这么窃窃私语的
- Not Leta's brother? - That's what they're whispering.

157
00:19:19,487 --> 00:19:23,063
不管是不是纯血统的  我知道这...
Pure-blood or not, I know this...

158
00:19:23,065 --> 00:19:26,130
在没有关爱的情况下成长
An Obscurus grows in the absence of love

159
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:28,527
把黑暗当成唯一的朋友
as a dark twin, an only friend.

160
00:19:28,529 --> 00:19:33,023
如果克雷登斯有一个真正的兄弟或姐妹或许可以取代默默然的位置
If Credence has a real brother or sister out there that can take its place,

161
00:19:33,025 --> 00:19:34,618
他也许还能得救
he might yet be saved.

162
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:40,412
无论克雷登斯在巴黎的什么地方  他要么处于危险之中  要么对他人构成危险
Wherever Credence is in Paris, he's either in danger or a danger to others.

163
00:19:40,853 --> 00:19:43,479
我们可能还不知道他是谁  但需要找到他
We may not know who he is yet, but he needs to be found.

164
00:19:45,105 --> 00:19:48,151
我很希望你能找到他
And I rather hoped you might be the one to find him.

165
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,753
那是什么
What's that?

166
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:59,256
我一个老熟人的地址
An address of a very old acquaintance of mine.

167
00:19:59,925 --> 00:20:03,634
巴黎的一座安全的房子  用魔法加固的
A safe house in Paris, reinforced with enchantments.

168
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:06,039
安全屋   为什么我要在巴黎要有个安全屋
Safe house? Why would I need a safe house in Paris?

169
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,704
希望你不会用上  但世事难料
One hopes you won't, but should things at some point

170
00:20:08,706 --> 00:20:11,217
万一出了大错  有个地方可以去是件好事
go terribly wrong, it's good to have a place to go.

171
00:20:11,595 --> 00:20:13,644
你知道的  也许还能喝一杯茶
You know, for a cup of tea.

172
00:20:13,894 --> 00:20:16,557
不  不  不  绝对不行
No, no, no, absolutely not.

173
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,657
我被禁止国际旅行了  邓不利多
I'm banned from international travel, Dumbledore.

174
00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:22,753
如果我离开这个国家  他们会把我关在阿兹卡班  然后扔掉钥匙的
If I leave the country, they will put me in Azkaban and throw away the key.

175
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,576
你知道我为什么那么欣赏你吗  纽特
Do you know why I admire you, Newt?

176
00:20:24,578 --> 00:20:25,597
什么
What?

177
00:20:25,709 --> 00:20:28,156
在我认识的人里面
More, perhaps, than any man I know?

178
00:20:30,135 --> 00:20:34,250
你不追求权力和声望
You don't seek power or popularity.

179
00:20:34,884 --> 00:20:39,909
你只需问  做这件事情是对的吗
You simply ask, is the thing right in itself?

180
00:20:41,392 --> 00:20:43,862
如果是  你就会去做  不管付出多大代价
If it is, you do it, no matter the cost.

181
00:20:44,517 --> 00:20:46,802
很好  邓布利多  但是  冒昧的问你一句
That's all very well, Dumbledore, but, forgive me for asking,

182
00:20:46,804 --> 00:20:48,778
为什么你不能去
why can't you go?

183
00:20:53,991 --> 00:20:56,617
我不能和格林德沃对着干
I cannot move against Grindelwald.

184
00:20:59,587 --> 00:21:00,915
一定要是你
It has to be you.

185
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:09,282
好吧  我不怪你
Well, I can't blame you,

186
00:21:09,284 --> 00:21:12,131
如果是我站在你的立场上  我也可能会拒绝
in your shoes I'd probably refuse too.

187
00:21:12,175 --> 00:21:13,414
-什么...   -天色已晚
- What...? - It's late.

188
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,479
-晚安  纽特   -等等  不
- Good evening, Newt. - Wait. No!

189
00:21:16,217 --> 00:21:17,616
哦  别这样
Oh, come on.

190
00:21:32,277 --> 00:21:33,969
邓布利多
Dumbledore.

191
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,671
布蒂
Bunty!

192
00:22:43,089 --> 00:22:44,089
布蒂
Bunty!

193
00:22:49,386 --> 00:22:51,762
布蒂  嗅嗅宝宝又跑出来了
Bunty, the baby Nifflers are loose again!

194
00:23:02,396 --> 00:23:03,416
干得好
Well done

195
00:23:04,018 --> 00:23:04,767
我很抱歉  纽特
I'm so sorry, Newt.

196
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:06,769
他们一定是在我清理奥格瑞的时候跑出来的
They must have picked the lock while I was cleaning out the Augureys

197
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:07,807
别担心
Not to worry.

198
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:17,613
我几乎给每个人都吃过了  给小粉用过了滴鼻剂
I've fed nearly everyone, Pinky's had his nose drops, and

199
00:23:17,614 --> 00:23:18,447
还有埃尔茜呢
And Elsie?

200
00:23:18,499 --> 00:23:21,874
-埃尔茜的粪便几乎又正常了   -太好了
- Elsie's droppings are nearly normal again. - Wonderful.

201
00:23:21,897 --> 00:23:25,007
你现在可以下班了
You can clock off now...

202
00:23:27,664 --> 00:23:30,666
-我告诉过你把马形水鬼留给我   -那个伤口需要更多的药膏
- I told you to leave the Kelpie to me. - That wound needs more ointment.

203
00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:32,730
我不想让你失去手指
I don't want you losing fingers over it.

204
00:23:42,106 --> 00:23:45,013
说真的  你现在回家去吧  布蒂
Seriously, you go home now, Bunty.

205
00:23:46,203 --> 00:23:47,454
你一定累坏了
You must be exhausted.

206
00:23:47,569 --> 00:23:49,883
你知道的  两个人在一起就容易多了
You know the Kelpie's easier with two.

207
00:23:54,703 --> 00:23:56,417
或许你应该脱下你的衬衫
Perhaps you should take off your shirt?

208
00:23:58,888 --> 00:24:02,132
别担心  我很快就会干透的
Don't worry, I'll dry off quickly enough.

209
00:24:43,653 --> 00:24:45,901
看来有人需要发泄一下
Someone needed to let off some steam.

210
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:47,513
药膏  布蒂
Ointment, Bunty?

211
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:57,215
你再咬布蒂  就会有大麻烦了  先生
You bite Bunty again and there'll be trouble, mister.

212
00:24:59,776 --> 00:25:02,215
-那是什么声   -我不知道
- What was that? - I don't know.

213
00:25:05,029 --> 00:25:06,993
但我要你现在回家  布蒂
But I want you to go home now, Bunty.

214
00:25:06,994 --> 00:25:10,807
-需要我想魔法部求助吗 -不  我要你回家  拜托
- Shall I call the Ministry? - No, I want you to go home. Please.

215
00:25:19,098 --> 00:25:20,527
如果你能把它给我.
If you could just give it to me...

216
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,058
宝贝  如果你能把它给我.
Honey, if you could just give it to me.

217
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:26,182
-他不在乎  等等   -如果你能把它给我.
- He doesn't care. Hold it. - If you could just give it to me.

218
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,227
嘿
Hey...

219
00:25:34,817 --> 00:25:37,867
纽特   快过来  你这个疯子
NEWT! Get over here, you maniac.

220
00:25:38,773 --> 00:25:41,305
我们希望你不介意  纽特   我们就这样进来了
We hope you don't mind, Newt? We let ourselves in...

221
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:43,902
外面在下瓢泼大雨
it's raining out there-cats and dogs!

222
00:25:44,332 --> 00:25:45,391
伦敦真冷
London's cold!

223
00:25:45,496 --> 00:25:48,195
但你本应该遗忘这些的
But you were supposed to have been Obliviated!

224
00:25:48,221 --> 00:25:50,631
我知道   但不管用  伙计
I know! It didn't work, pal.

225
00:25:50,914 --> 00:25:54,031
我是说  你说过  魔药只会抹去不好的记忆
I mean, you said it, the potion only erases bad memories.

226
00:25:54,032 --> 00:25:55,276
我没有什么不好的记忆
I didn't have any.

227
00:25:55,277 --> 00:25:59,670
我是说  别误会  我是有一些奇怪的回忆
I mean, don't get me wrong, I had some weird ones...

228
00:25:59,671 --> 00:26:00,979
但这个天使..
but this angel...

229
00:26:01,074 --> 00:26:05,035
这位天使  她把所有不好的事情都告诉了我
this angel over here, she filled me in on all the bad parts.

230
00:26:05,058 --> 00:26:07,667
我们就到这了  我想  是吧
And here we are, I guess, huh?

231
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:10,423
太棒了
This is wonderful!

232
00:26:13,836 --> 00:26:16,171
是..蒂娜吗
Is ...Tina?

233
00:26:17,662 --> 00:26:18,750
蒂娜
Tina?

234
00:26:20,884 --> 00:26:22,803
哦  只有我们  亲爱的
Oh it's just us, honey.

235
00:26:23,743 --> 00:26:25,026
只有我和雅各布
Me and Jacob.

236
00:26:26,866 --> 00:26:28,787
要不我给你们做晚饭吧
Why don't I make us some dinner, huh?

237
00:26:28,814 --> 00:26:29,814
好
Yes!

238
00:26:35,731 --> 00:26:38,325
蒂娜和我没在说过话
Tina and I aren't talking.

239
00:26:38,671 --> 00:26:39,666
为什么
Why?

240
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:42,321
哦  好吧  你知道  她发现了雅各布的事
Oh well, you know, she found out about Jacob and

241
00:26:42,347 --> 00:26:44,813
我见过对方了 但她不喜欢这样
I seeing each other and she didn't like it,

242
00:26:44,814 --> 00:26:46,352
因为法律
cause of the law

243
00:26:46,353 --> 00:26:50,537
不允许这样做  也不允许和麻鸡约会
Not allowed oops, not allowed to date No-Majs,

244
00:26:50,538 --> 00:26:53,851
不允许和他们结婚 的大废话
not allowed to marry them blah, blah, blah.

245
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:57,605
好吧  不管怎么说  她也是头晕目眩的  因为你
Well, she was all in a tizzy anyway, 'cause of you.

246
00:26:57,837 --> 00:26:58,790
我
Me?

247
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:00,593
是啊  你  纽特
Yeah, you, Newt.

248
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:02,661
因为这本意乱情迷
It was in Spellbound.

249
00:27:02,734 --> 00:27:04,605
我给你带来了
Here-I brought it for you-

250
00:27:08,808 --> 00:27:12,472
纽特·斯卡曼德和未婚妻莉塔·莱斯特兰奇
Newt Scamander with fiancée, Leta Lestrange...

251
00:27:12,473 --> 00:27:14,632
老兄  忒修斯和无名氏女子
brother, Theseus and unknown woman.

252
00:27:15,596 --> 00:27:18,471
不  是忒修斯要娶的是莉塔  不是我
No. Theseus is marrying Leta, not me.

253
00:27:18,506 --> 00:27:19,651
哦
Oh!

254
00:27:21,116 --> 00:27:23,451
噢  噢亲爱的
Oh, oh dear.

255
00:27:24,572 --> 00:27:25,666
哇
Wah.

256
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:31,554
所以蒂娜读了之后  然后她开始和别人约会了
So Tina read that, and she started dating someone else.

257
00:27:32,695 --> 00:27:35,114
他是个傲罗  他的名字是阿基里斯·托列夫
He's an Auror. His name's Achilles Tolliver.

258
00:27:35,115 --> 00:27:36,398
托列夫
Tolliver?

259
00:27:42,588 --> 00:27:46,141
无论如何...我们很高兴来到这里  纽特
Anyway... We're real excited to be here, Newt.

260
00:27:46,301 --> 00:27:49,661
这是  哦  这是我们的特别之旅
This is a, oh it's a special trip for us

261
00:27:49,697 --> 00:27:52,513
你看  雅各布和我
You see, Jacob and I,

262
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:54,894
我们要结婚了
we're getting married.

263
00:27:57,984 --> 00:27:59,813
我要和雅各布结婚了
I'm marrying Jacob!

264
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,255
你让他着迷了  不是吗
You've enchanted him, haven't you?

265
00:28:10,401 --> 00:28:11,401
什么
What?

266
00:28:12,582 --> 00:28:14,122
我没有
I have not.

267
00:28:14,711 --> 00:28:16,631
你能别再读我的心了吗
Will you stop reading my mind?

268
00:28:16,633 --> 00:28:19,428
奎妮  你违背他的意愿把他带到这里来的
Queenie, you've brought him here against his will.

269
00:28:19,453 --> 00:28:21,537
哦  那是个无耻的指控
Oh, that is an outrageous accusation.

270
00:28:21,751 --> 00:28:25,569
你看看他  他只是很开心
Look at him. He's just happy.

271
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:27,442
那你不会介意我...
Then you won't mind if I...

272
00:28:29,153 --> 00:28:30,368
拜托  别这样
Please don't!

273
00:28:30,719 --> 00:28:33,108
奎妮  如果他想和你结婚的话 你没什么好担心的
Queenie, you've got nothing to fear if he wants to get married.

274
00:28:33,109 --> 00:28:36,058
我们可以解除魔法  他可以自己告诉我们
We can just lift the enchantment... and he can tell us himself.

275
00:28:45,997 --> 00:28:47,505
你拿了什么
What you got there?

276
00:28:47,821 --> 00:28:51,509
你要做什么   斯卡曼德先生  你打算怎么做
What gonna do? Whatchu gonna do with that, Mr. Scamander?

277
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:52,771
Surgito.

278
00:29:03,788 --> 00:29:06,323
恭喜你  你订婚了  雅各布
Congratulations on your engagement, Jacob.

279
00:29:06,348 --> 00:29:07,348
等等  什么
Wait, what?

280
00:29:11,089 --> 00:29:13,351
哦不  你没有
Oh no, you didn't.

281
00:29:15,693 --> 00:29:17,958
奎妮  稍等一下
Queen. A second.

282
00:29:19,229 --> 00:29:20,229
奎妮
Queenie!

283
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,928
很高兴见到你
It's very nice to see you.

284
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,625
我现在到底在哪
Where the hell am I right now?

285
00:29:24,625 --> 00:29:25,625
呃  呃  伦敦
Uh, uh, London.

286
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:28,513
哦   我一直想来这里
Oh! I always wanted to go here!

287
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:30,934
奎妮
Queenie!

288
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,866
哦  奎妮  亲爱的
Oh Queenie, honey.

289
00:29:36,477 --> 00:29:40,230
好吧  我只是好奇  你什么时候叫醒我   在我们生了5个孩子之后
Well, I'm just curious, when were you going to wake me up? After we'd had five kids?

290
00:29:43,184 --> 00:29:45,956
-想和你结婚有错吗   -好吧
- Why is it wrong to want to marry you? - Okay.

291
00:29:45,957 --> 00:29:48,608
我只是想要一个家庭
To wanna have a family?

292
00:29:48,609 --> 00:29:51,443
我只想要别人都有的东西  仅此而已
I just want what everyone else has, that's all.

293
00:29:53,377 --> 00:29:54,590
好吧  等等.
Okay, wait..

294
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:57,350
我们谈过无数次了
We talked about this, like, a million times.

295
00:29:57,352 --> 00:29:59,067
如果我们结婚了他们发现了  他们
If we get married and they find out, they're

296
00:29:59,092 --> 00:30:00,478
会把你送进监狱的  亲爱的
gonna throw you in jail, sweetheart.

297
00:30:00,479 --> 00:30:02,509
我不能这么做
I can't have that.

298
00:30:03,517 --> 00:30:05,917
他们不喜欢我这样的人嫁给你这样的人
They don't like people like me marrying people like you.

299
00:30:06,018 --> 00:30:08,917
我不是法师  我只是我自己
I ain't a wizard. I'm just me.

300
00:30:09,268 --> 00:30:13,452
他们如果真的是进步派  他们会让我们好好结婚的
They're really progressive here, and they'll let us get married properly.

301
00:30:13,453 --> 00:30:16,008
宝贝  你不需要让我着迷
Sweetheart, you don't need to enchant me.

302
00:30:16,503 --> 00:30:18,128
我已经被你迷住了
I'm already enchanted!

303
00:30:19,269 --> 00:30:21,268
我太爱你了
I love you so much.

304
00:30:21,518 --> 00:30:22,977
-是吗   -是的
- Yeah?? - Yeah.

305
00:30:23,977 --> 00:30:26,480
但我不能让你冒这么大的险  你知道吗
But I can't have you risking everything like this, you know?

306
00:30:26,482 --> 00:30:29,356
你不比给我们选择的  亲爱的
You're not giving us a choice, sweetheart.

307
00:30:31,684 --> 00:30:34,211
你没有给我选择的余地
You're not givin' me a choice.

308
00:30:34,213 --> 00:30:37,969
我们中的一个必须勇敢  而你是个懦夫
One of us had to be brave, and you were being a coward!

309
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,855
我是个懦夫
I was being a coward?

310
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:44,115
如果我是个懦夫  你就是...
If I'm a coward, you're...

311
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,702
疯子
Crazy!

312
00:30:48,131 --> 00:30:49,693
我没这么说...
I didn't say it...

313
00:30:49,694 --> 00:30:50,837
你没必要这么做
You didn't have to.

314
00:30:50,838 --> 00:30:52,653
不  我不是故意的  亲爱的
No, I didn't mean it, sweetheart.

315
00:30:53,432 --> 00:30:54,801
你说了
Yeah, you did.

316
00:30:55,855 --> 00:30:56,855
没有
No!

317
00:30:57,015 --> 00:30:58,325
我要去看望我姐姐了
I'm gonna go see my sister.

318
00:30:59,711 --> 00:31:00,896
好吧  去看你姐姐吧
Fine. See your sister.

319
00:31:00,897 --> 00:31:02,243
-很好   -不   等等
- Fine. - No! Wait!

320
00:31:02,244 --> 00:31:05,037
奎妮   不   奎妮
Queenie! No! Queenie!

321
00:31:06,516 --> 00:31:08,505
我不是那个意思
I didn't mean it.

322
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:12,830
我什么都没说
I didn't say nothing.

323
00:31:32,394 --> 00:31:34,557
巴黎
PARIS

324
00:31:38,157 --> 00:31:41,141
我亲爱的奎妮  多么美丽的城市啊
My dear Queenie, what a beautiful city.

325
00:31:41,558 --> 00:31:43,701
我在想你  蒂娜

326
00:31:49,916 --> 00:31:51,415
嘿  纽特

327
00:31:51,416 --> 00:31:54,616

Down here, Jacob. I'll be with you in a second.

328
00:31:59,093 --> 00:32:00,672
我也有我自己的问题要处理
I got my own problems.

329
00:32:08,073 --> 00:32:10,760
布蒂   别忘了给帕特里克喂药丸
BUNTY! DON'T FORGET TO GIVE PATRICK PELLETS.

330
00:32:25,386 --> 00:32:27,386
奎妮留了张明信片
Queenie left a postcard.

331
00:32:27,818 --> 00:32:29,659
蒂娜在巴黎找克雷登斯

332
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,947
太好了
Genius!

333
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,620
奎妮要直接去找蒂娜
Queenie's gonna go straight for Tina.

334
00:32:32,622 --> 00:32:34,693
好吧  我们要去法国了  伙计
Okay, we're going to France, pal!

335
00:32:34,694 --> 00:32:36,031
等等  我去拿我的夹克
Hold on. I'll get my jacket.

336
00:32:36,032 --> 00:32:37,032
帮你拿到了
I've got it.

337
00:32:45,585 --> 00:32:46,585
哦  真好
Oh. Beautiful.

338
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:51,769
布蒂  我去巴黎了  带走了一个嗅嗅  纽特
BUNTY, GONE TO PARIS. HAVE TAKEN NIFFLERS WITH ME. NEWT.

339
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:06,965
纳吉尼

340
00:34:12,831 --> 00:34:13,854
克雷登斯
Credence.

341
00:34:16,764 --> 00:34:18,604
我想我知道她在哪儿
I think I know where she is.

342
00:34:25,312 --> 00:34:26,763
我们今晚就逃之夭夭
We escape tonight.

343
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:27,764
嘿
Hey.

344
00:34:33,433 --> 00:34:36,489
我告诉过你离她远点  小子
I've told you to stay away from her, boy.

345
00:34:36,999 --> 00:34:38,906
我说过你可以休息了吗
Did I say you could take a break?

346
00:34:39,633 --> 00:34:40,981
把卡帕清理干净
Clean out the Kappa.

347
00:34:43,087 --> 00:34:44,570
你  准备好
And you, get ready!

348
00:34:57,259 --> 00:35:01,873
下一个是我们的怪胎和怪人秀
Next in our little show of freaks and oddities...

349
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,508
我向你们介绍.
I present to you...

350
00:35:04,509 --> 00:35:06,233
马德里图斯
a Maledictus!

351
00:35:09,722 --> 00:35:12,960
曾经被困在印度尼西亚的丛林里
Once trapped in the jungles of Indonesia,

352
00:35:13,437 --> 00:35:16,480
她是一个血液诅咒的携带者
she is the carrier of a blood curse.

353
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:21,875
这样的存在是注定 一生都要背负着这种诅咒的
Such Under-beings are destined, through the course of their lives...

354
00:35:22,335 --> 00:35:24,922
注定会永远变成一个怪兽
to turn permanently into beasts.

355
00:35:28,409 --> 00:35:33,206
现在他看起来很漂亮 对吗
But look at her. So beautiful, yes?

356
00:35:34,752 --> 00:35:36,864
太令人向往了
So desirable.

357
00:35:37,417 --> 00:35:42,018
但很快她就会永远被困在一个完全不同的身体里
But soon she will be trapped forever in a very different body.

358
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,621
每天晚上  当她睡着的时候.
Every night, when she sleeps...

359
00:35:45,622 --> 00:35:47,947
女士们还有先生们
mesdames et messieurs...

360
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:51,070
她就会被迫成为
She is forced to become...

361
00:35:58,941 --> 00:36:01,085
她就会被迫成为
She is forced to become...

362
00:36:06,191 --> 00:36:09,050
她就会被迫成为
She is forced to become...

363
00:36:18,368 --> 00:36:22,407
随着时间的推移  她将无法转变回来
Over time, she will not be able to transform back.

364
00:36:24,439 --> 00:36:28,590
她将永远被困在蛇的身体里
She will be forever trapped in the body of a snake.

365
00:37:01,846 --> 00:37:02,846
克雷登斯
Credence!

366
00:37:12,288 --> 00:37:13,407
打包走人
Pack it up!

367
00:37:13,803 --> 00:37:15,775
巴黎已经不能待了
Paris is done for us now.

368
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:48,439
那个小子  你对他了解多少
The boy with the Maledictus, what do you know about him?

369
00:37:51,781 --> 00:37:53,714
他在找他妈妈
He's looking for his mother.

370
00:37:53,737 --> 00:37:56,800
我这所有的怪物都认为他们能回家
All my freaks think they can go home.

371
00:37:58,995 --> 00:38:00,548
好吧  我们走
Okay, let's go.

372
00:38:17,353 --> 00:38:21,041
听着  我想我们都去马戏团是出于同样的原因  先生 你叫什么
Look, I think we were both at the circus for the same reason, monsieur ...?

373
00:38:21,656 --> 00:38:23,751
卡玛  尤瑟夫·卡玛
Kama. Yusuf Kama.

374
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:26,148
你说的没错
And you think right.

375
00:38:26,149 --> 00:38:28,808
-你找克雷登斯做什么   -和你一样
- What do you want with Credence? - The same as you.

376
00:38:28,833 --> 00:38:31,333
-哪个   -为了证明这个男孩是谁
- Which is? - To prove who the boy really is.

377
00:38:34,927 --> 00:38:38,552
如果关于他身份的谣言是正确的
If the rumors of his identity are correct, he and

378
00:38:38,635 --> 00:38:40,841
他和我是远亲
I are distantly related.

379
00:38:42,397 --> 00:38:44,519
我是我家族里纯种血统的最后一个男性
I am the last male of my pure-blooded line.

380
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,389
所以  如果谣言是对的  那么他也是
And so, if the rumors are correct, is he.

381
00:38:48,688 --> 00:38:52,853
你读过第谷·多多斯的预言吗
Have you read The Predictions of Tycho Dodonus?

382
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:56,893
是啊  但那是诗  不是证据
Yeah. But that's poetry, not proof.

383
00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:02,562
如果我能给你看些更好的
If I could show you something better

384
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,710
更具体的  能证明他是谁的东西
more concrete, something that proves who he is

385
00:39:07,757 --> 00:39:11,548
欧洲和美国的部会让他活着吗
would the Ministries of Europe and America let him live?

386
00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:13,483
可能吧
They might.

387
00:39:15,824 --> 00:39:17,211
那就来吧
Then come.

388
00:39:42,072 --> 00:39:43,166
所以…
So...

389
00:39:46,687 --> 00:39:48,576
克里登斯 巴波
Credence Barebone.

390
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:54,714
他的一生几乎被抚养她的女人给毁了
Nearly destroyed by the woman who raised him.

391
00:39:54,715 --> 00:39:58,120
然而现在他却在寻找生他的母亲
Yet now he seeks the mother who bore him.

392
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:00,853
他渴望有个家
He's desperate for family.

393
00:40:01,235 --> 00:40:03,014
他渴望被关爱
He's desperate for love.

394
00:40:04,175 --> 00:40:07,154
他是我们胜利的关键
He's the key to our victory.

395
00:40:07,759 --> 00:40:10,134
好吧  我们知道这小子在哪  不是吗
Well, we know where the boy is, don't we?

396
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:14,791
-我们为什么不抓住他然后离开   -他必须要自愿的来找我
- Why don't we grab him and leave! - He must come to me freely...

397
00:40:14,905 --> 00:40:16,400
他会的
and he will.

398
00:40:17,977 --> 00:40:22,114
这条路已经铺好了  他正在沿着这条路走
The path has been laid, and he is following it.

399
00:40:23,747 --> 00:40:26,039
会让他找到我的线索
The trail that will lead him to me,

400
00:40:26,978 --> 00:40:30,737
以及他是谁 还有他那神秘的身份
and the strange and glorious truth of who he is.

401
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,602
为什么他这么重要
Why is he so important?

402
00:40:39,939 --> 00:40:44,395
对我们的事业构成最大的威胁是谁
Who represents the greatest threat to our cause?

403
00:40:45,477 --> 00:40:46,727
阿不思·邓布利多
Albus Dumbledore.

404
00:40:46,774 --> 00:40:50,869
如果我让你现在去学校...去他那里
If I asked you now to go to the school... where he is

405
00:40:50,895 --> 00:40:55,369
为我藏起来杀了他  你会为我这么做吗  卡尔
hiding and kill him for me, would you do it for me, Krall?

406
00:41:01,476 --> 00:41:04,885
克雷登斯是唯一活着的实体
Credence is the only entity alive...

407
00:41:05,485 --> 00:41:07,302
谁能杀了他
who can kill him.

408
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,217
你真的认为他能杀死伟大的..
You really think that he can kill the great...

409
00:41:13,864 --> 00:41:16,092
会杀了阿不思·邓布利多吗
can kill Albus Dumbledore?

410
00:41:16,819 --> 00:41:17,944
我知道他可以
I know he can.

411
00:41:19,417 --> 00:41:23,220
但是当那发生的时候你会和我们在一起吗  卡尔
But will you be with us when that happens, Krall?

412
00:41:26,623 --> 00:41:27,905
你还会吗
Will you?

413
00:41:39,916 --> 00:41:42,419
雅各布  蒂娜见过的那个人.
Jacob, that man Tina's been seeing...

414
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,019
别担心  她会见到你的
Don't worry, she's gonna see you.

415
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,827
她会看到我们四个在一起
And she'll see the four of us together, it'll be just

416
00:41:45,852 --> 00:41:47,566
又像在纽约一样  不用担心
like New York all over again. Don't worry about it.

417
00:41:47,569 --> 00:41:50,687
-奎妮说 他是个傲罗  -好吧  他是个傲罗  那又怎样
- Yes, but he's an Auror, Queenie said? - Yeah, he's an Auror. So what?

418
00:41:50,688 --> 00:41:51,762
别担心他
Don't worry about him.

419
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:57,990
如果我见到她  你觉得我该对她说什么
What do you think I should say to her, if I see her?

420
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,310
哦  好吧  最好还是不要提前想好
Oh, well, it's best not to plan these things.

421
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:06,209
到时候想说什么就说什么吧
You know, you just say whatever comes to you in the moment.

422
00:42:10,727 --> 00:42:13,477
她的眼睛就像火蜥蜴一样
She has eyes just like a salamander.

423
00:42:14,025 --> 00:42:15,111
别这么说
Don't say that.

424
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:22,227
不行  听着  你只要告诉她你想她
Nah, look, you just tell her that you missed her.

425
00:42:22,228 --> 00:42:26,715
是啊  然后你大老远跑到巴黎就是为了找到她
Right, and then you came all the way to Paris just to find her.

426
00:42:27,562 --> 00:42:28,770
她会喜欢的
She'll love that.

427
00:42:28,771 --> 00:42:33,608
然后  告诉她你晚上会因为想起她而失眠
And then, tell her you're losing sleep at night for thinking of her.

428
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:37,096
别再说什么火蜥蜴的事  好吗
Just don't say anything about no salamanders, all right?

429
00:42:37,097 --> 00:42:38,363
对 我可以做到
Right. Okay.

430
00:42:38,977 --> 00:42:43,478
嘿  嘿  嘿  一切都会好起来的
Hey, hey, hey. It's gonna be all right.

431
00:42:43,549 --> 00:42:45,080
我们是一伙的  伙计
We're in this together, pal.

432
00:42:45,081 --> 00:42:49,364
好吧  我会帮你的  我要帮你找到蒂娜  然后去找到奎妮
Okay, I'm gonna help you out. I'm gonna help you find Tina, find Queenie,

433
00:42:49,561 --> 00:42:52,561
我们都会高兴的  就像以前一样
and we'll all be happy again. Just like old times.

434
00:42:52,585 --> 00:42:53,585
他是谁
Who is this guy?

435
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,354
他是我在没有文件的情况下离开这个国家的唯一途径
He's the only way I can leave the country without documentation.

436
00:42:58,354 --> 00:43:01,115
你应该没有晕动症吧  是吗
Now, you don't suffer from motion sickness, do you?

437
00:43:01,352 --> 00:43:03,728
我晕船  纽特
I don't do well on boats, Newt.

438
00:43:03,864 --> 00:43:04,864
不会有事的
You'll be fine.

439
00:43:04,898 --> 00:43:07,461
赶紧的  一分钟后就要出发
Stir your stumps-it leaves in one minute!

440
00:43:08,784 --> 00:43:09,876
五十加隆
Fifty Galleons.

441
00:43:10,132 --> 00:43:11,636
不  我们说好的三十
No, we said thirty.

442
00:43:11,736 --> 00:43:13,519
三十是去法国的路费
Thirty to go to France,

443
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:18,658
剩下的二十是封口费 我不告诉任何人我看见纽特·斯卡曼德非法离开了这个国家
twenty not to tell anyone, I seen Newt Scamander leaving the country illegally.

444
00:43:20,071 --> 00:43:21,938
出名的代价  伙计
Price of fame, pal.

445
00:43:26,427 --> 00:43:27,483
还有十秒钟
Ten seconds.

446
00:43:29,194 --> 00:43:30,194
雅各伯

00:43:40,413 --> 00:43:42,741
二  一
Two. One.

452
00:43:52,367 --> 00:43:54,343
我不喜欢波特基 纽特
I didn't like that Portkey, Newt.

453
00:43:54,344 --> 00:43:55,905
所以你一直在抱怨
So you keep saying.

454
00:43:56,262 --> 00:43:57,262
跟我来
Follow me.

455
00:44:04,143 --> 00:44:05,393
Confundus.

456
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:12,231
快点  再过几分钟就没效果了
Come on. That'll wear off in a few minutes.

457
00:44:24,768 --> 00:44:26,268
Appare vestigium.

458
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:32,852
释放嗅嗅
Accio Niffler...

459
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:36,333
快去找找   快去找找
Get looking. Oi! Get looking.

460
00:44:40,727 --> 00:44:41,727
这是个卡帕
That's a Kappa.

461
00:44:42,509 --> 00:44:44,415
这是个日本水妖
That's a Japanese water demon.

462
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:49,895
蒂娜
Tina?

463
00:44:50,772 --> 00:44:51,772
蒂娜
Tina?!

464
00:44:58,532 --> 00:44:59,764
你发现了什么
What have you found?

465
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:06,042
我们现在 在舔脏东西吗
And we're licking the dirt now. Revelio.

466
00:45:23,806 --> 00:45:25,827
纽特...这是什么东西
Newt... what made those?

467
00:45:26,452 --> 00:45:27,842
那是邹武
That is a Zouwu.

468
00:45:30,471 --> 00:45:34,735
是一种中国生物  它们的速度和威力都令人难以置信
It's a Chinese creature. They are incredibly fast and incredibly powerful.

469
00:45:34,736 --> 00:45:37,062
他们能一天能走一千里路
They can travel a thousand miles in a day

470
00:45:37,163 --> 00:45:41,093
只要一步就可以让你从巴黎的一个地方跳到下一个地方
and this one could take you from one part of Paris to the next in a single leap.

471
00:45:45,352 --> 00:45:46,352
哦  好孩子
Oh, good boy.

472
00:45:48,101 --> 00:45:51,102
雅各布  她在这里  蒂娜曾站在这里
Jacob, she was here. Tina stood here.

473
00:45:51,503 --> 00:45:53,834
她的脚很窄  你注意到了吗
She has incredibly narrow feet, have you noticed?

474
00:45:55,702 --> 00:45:57,149
我可看不出来
Can't say that I have.

475
00:46:01,488 --> 00:46:03,127
后来有人朝她走过来
Then someone came towards her.

476
00:46:15,143 --> 00:46:16,852
Avenseguim.

477
00:46:21,139 --> 00:46:22,851
-跟着那羽毛走   -什么
- Follow that feather. - What?

478
00:46:22,852 --> 00:46:24,812
-雅各布  跟着羽毛走   -跟着羽毛走
- Jacob, follow the feather. - Follow the feather.

479
00:46:25,181 --> 00:46:28,518
它去哪儿   啊  收回嗅嗅
Where is he? Ah, Accio Niffler.

480
00:46:35,868 --> 00:46:36,917
把水桶扔了
Let go of the bucket!

481
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:17,176
欢迎来到魔法事务部
Bienvenue Au Ministère des Affaires Magiques.

482
00:47:17,354 --> 00:47:20,309
对不起  我完全不知道你刚才说了什么
I'm sorry, I don't know what you just said at all.

483
00:47:20,733 --> 00:47:25,174

Welcome to the French Ministry of Magic. What is your business, please?

484

我要找蒂娜·戈德斯坦
I need to speak to Tina Goldstein.

485
00:47:29,966 --> 00:47:35,501
她正在办案是一个美国傲罗
She's an American Auror working on a case here.

486
00:47:39,759 --> 00:47:42,197
我们这里没有蒂娜·戈德斯坦
We have no Tina Goldstein here.

487
00:47:42,412 --> 00:47:45,373
不  这.. 我很抱歉这一定是搞错了
No, it's... I'm sorry there must be some sort of mistake.

488
00:47:45,374 --> 00:47:48,272
我知道她在巴黎  她给我寄了张明信片
See, I know she's in Paris, she sent me a postcard.

I brought it, I can show it to you. Maybe you

491
00:47:53,531 --> 00:47:54,531
哦  倒霉
Oh rabbits!

492
00:47:54,843 --> 00:47:57,017
请稍等一下
If you can just wait one moment!

493
00:47:57,018 --> 00:48:00,154
我知道它就在这里的某个地方  我肯定带了  在哪里
I know it's in here somewhere. I definitely packed it. Where?

494
00:48:00,768 --> 00:48:02,177
稍等一下
One second.

495
00:48:05,812 --> 00:48:07,295
你先请
Please.

496
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:41,614
我们能不能停下来喝杯咖啡  或者
Could we at least stop for a coffee, or like a...

497
00:48:41,639 --> 00:48:42,693
现在不行  雅各布
Not now, Jacob.

498
00:48:48,145 --> 00:48:49,969
往这边走  快点
This way. Come on.

499
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:54,017
吃巧克力面包   半根羊角面包  或者是一个棒棒糖
Pain Au chocolat? Half a croissant, or like, a bonbon?

500
00:48:54,018 --> 00:48:55,018
往这边走
This way.

501
00:49:00,099 --> 00:49:01,267
雅各伯
Jacob!

502
00:49:15,132 --> 00:49:16,414
雅各伯
Jacob?

503
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:04,069
夫人
Madame?

504
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,356
夫人  你还好吗
Tout Va bien, Madame?

505
00:50:59,657 --> 00:51:01,077
她回来了
She's home.

506
00:51:38,459 --> 00:51:39,459
谁在那里
Qui est l?

507
00:51:44,762 --> 00:51:47,043
夫人  请听我说 你的儿子来了
C'est votre fils, madame.

508
00:51:47,076 --> 00:51:48,315
你是谁
Qui êtes-vous?

509
00:51:48,317 --> 00:51:49,927
你是艾玛吗
Are you Irma?

510
00:51:51,273 --> 00:51:53,463
你...   你是艾玛·杜加德吗
Are you ...? Are you Irma Dugard?

511
00:51:54,833 --> 00:51:59,543
打扰了  我的领养纸上是你的名字
I'm sorry. Your name is on my adoption paper.

512
00:52:01,221 --> 00:52:02,674
你都知道什么
Does this make sense?

513
00:52:04,626 --> 00:52:07,650
你把我交给了纽约的巴瑞斯太太
You gave me to Mrs. Barebone in New York.

514
00:52:26,523 --> 00:52:28,083
我不是你妈妈
I am not your mother.

515
00:52:28,824 --> 00:52:30,545
我只是个仆人
I was only a servant.

516
00:52:34,259 --> 00:52:36,371
你真是个帅气的孩子
You were so beautiful baby.

517
00:52:39,146 --> 00:52:41,373
你真是个帅气的小伙
And you are a beautiful man.

518
00:52:52,108 --> 00:52:54,343
我很想你
I have missed you.

519
00:52:54,821 --> 00:52:56,462
为什么他们不想要我
Why didn't they want me?

520
00:53:01,016 --> 00:53:03,883
但为什么你的名字会出现在我的收养纸上
But why is your name on my adoption paper?

521
00:53:04,193 --> 00:53:06,589
我本应该带你去找巴瑞斯太太的
I took you to Mrs. Barebone

522
00:53:07,501 --> 00:53:11,322
因为她会照顾你的
because she was supposed to look after you.

523
00:55:18,698 --> 00:55:20,257
她死了
She's dead.

524
00:55:22,855 --> 00:55:25,488
那小子怎么样
How did the boy take it?

525
00:55:25,512 --> 00:55:27,375
他很敏感
He's sensitive.

526
00:55:29,629 --> 00:55:33,482
魔法部知道我出了差错  不会高兴的
The Ministry won't be happy when I tell them I've missed.

527
00:55:33,483 --> 00:55:35,943
-他们知道我的名声...  -听我说..
- They know my reputation.. - Listen to me...

528
00:55:35,944 --> 00:55:40,228
那些懦夫的不赞成是对勇敢的人的赞扬
The disapproval of cowards is praise to the brave.

529
00:55:40,229 --> 00:55:45,729
当法师统治世界的时候  你的名字将会以荣耀的形式写出来
Your name will be written in glory when wizards rule the world.

530
00:55:46,333 --> 00:55:49,327
而这个时间越来越近了
And the clock is ticking faster.

531
00:55:49,837 --> 00:55:51,621
你照看着克雷登斯
You watch over Credence.

532
00:55:51,981 --> 00:55:53,568
保护他的安全
Keep him safe.

533
00:55:54,468 --> 00:55:56,029
为了更伟大的利益
For the greater good.

534
00:55:57,675 --> 00:55:58,989
为了更伟大的利益
For the greater good.

535
00:56:02,481 --> 00:56:04,857
你知道  我想念奎妮什么吗
You know what I miss about Queenie?

536
00:56:06,829 --> 00:56:07,885
什么都想
Everything.

537
00:56:10,391 --> 00:56:13,297
我甚至怀念那些让我发疯的东西
I even miss the stuff that drove me nuts.

538
00:56:13,298 --> 00:56:15,019
就像读心术一样
Like the mind reading.

539
00:56:21,132 --> 00:56:23,709
我很幸运有她这样的人
I was lucky to have someone like her

540
00:56:23,791 --> 00:56:26,001
对我想的任何事都感兴趣
even interested in anything I thought.

541
00:56:27,958 --> 00:56:29,018
你知道我的意思吗
You know what I mean?

542
00:56:30,708 --> 00:56:31,779
什么
Sorry?

543
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:40,459
我是说  你确定我们要找的人在这里
I was saying, you're sure the guy is here that we're looking for?

544
00:56:40,689 --> 00:56:42,633
当然  羽毛是这么表现得
Definitely. The feather says so.

545
00:57:13,289 --> 00:57:15,540
-我们要找的人是他吗   -是的
- Is that the guy we're looking for? - Yes.

546
00:57:21,391 --> 00:57:22,391
先生
Sire.

547
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:25,313
呃..你好  你好  先生
Err... bonjour. Bonjour, monsieur.

548
00:57:26,528 --> 00:57:27,684
等等  不  等等
Oh wait, no, sorry!

549
00:57:27,685 --> 00:57:31,685
我们只是想知道你会不会遇到  呃  我们的一个朋友..
We were just wondering if you'd come across uh, a friend of ours...

550
00:57:31,996 --> 00:57:33,389
蒂娜·戈德斯坦
Tina Goldstein.

551
00:57:34,003 --> 00:57:36,251
先生  巴黎可是个大城市
Monsieur, Paris is a large city.

552
00:57:36,852 --> 00:57:37,852
她是个傲罗
She's an Auror..

553
00:57:38,096 --> 00:57:42,722
当傲罗失踪时  魔法部会来找她的  所以…
When Aurors go missing, the Ministry tend to come looking. So...

554
00:57:44,329 --> 00:57:47,614
好吧  现在我想我们最好还是报告她失踪了吧
No, now I suppose it would probably be better if we just report her absence.

555
00:57:47,637 --> 00:57:48,637
高个子 
Is she tall? 

556
00:57:50,638 --> 00:57:51,912
黑发
Dark rather...

557
00:57:51,913 --> 00:57:53,404
-有点紧张   -漂亮
- intense? - Beautiful.

558
00:57:53,612 --> 00:57:56,041
是的  我想说的是
Yeah, what I meant to say-

559
00:57:56,043 --> 00:57:58,356
她非常 非常漂亮
she's very-very pretty!

560
00:57:59,278 --> 00:58:02,633
我想我昨晚见过这样的人
I think I saw someone like this last night.

561
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:08,120
-也许我能带你去找她   -如果你不介意的话  那就.
- Perhaps if I showed you where? - If you wouldn't mind. That would be...

562
00:58:09,227 --> 00:58:10,427
-那就太好了   -当然
- That would be lovely. - Sure.

563
00:58:49,251 --> 00:58:50,251
蒂娜
Tina?

564
00:58:52,185 --> 00:58:54,185
纽特
Newt!

565
00:58:56,483 --> 00:58:59,917
我很抱歉  斯卡曼德先生
My apologies, Mr. Scamander!

566
00:58:59,958 --> 00:59:03,917
一旦克雷登斯死了  我就会回来释放你
I shall return and release you once Credence is dead!

567
00:59:04,061 --> 00:59:04,947
卡玛  等等
Kama, wait!

568
00:59:04,947 --> 00:59:08,625
你看  不是他死就是我亡
You see, either he dies... or I do.

569
00:59:09,806 --> 00:59:11,086
不  不  不
No, no, no.

570
00:59:12,576 --> 00:59:17,336
哦不  不  不  不
Oh no. No, no, no.

571
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,185
好吧  营救行动看来出了点偏差
Well, that's not the best start to a rescue attempt.

572
00:59:26,186 --> 00:59:28,177
这是一次营救行动吗
This was a rescue attempt?

573
00:59:28,177 --> 00:59:30,778
你刚刚让我失去了我唯一的线索
You've just lost me my only lead.

574
00:59:30,779 --> 00:59:33,666
好吧  在我们出现之前审讯进行得怎么样了
Well, how was the interrogation going before we turned up?

575
00:59:37,268 --> 00:59:38,518
纽特
Newt!

576
00:59:42,991 --> 00:59:44,072
干得好  皮克
Well done, Pick.

577
00:59:46,741 --> 00:59:50,227
-所以说你需要这个人   -是的
- So, you need this man, you say? - Yeah.

578
00:59:50,727 --> 00:59:53,810
我想这个人知道克雷登斯在哪里  斯卡曼德先生
I think this man knows where Credence is, Mr. Scamander.

579
00:59:58,256 --> 01:00:00,260
好吧  那就是邹武了
Well, that'll be the Zouwu.

580
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:21,527
快点  纽特  离开那里
Come on, Newt, get out of there!

581
01:01:47,593 --> 01:01:51,736
你上次犯的三个最大的错误是什么
What were the three biggest mistakes that you made last time?

582
01:01:52,472 --> 01:01:54,120
出其不意  先生
Caught by surprise, sir.

583
01:01:54,518 --> 01:01:55,799
还有什么
What else?

584
01:01:56,139 --> 01:01:58,245
在反击之前没有退缩  先生
Didn't parry before counter-curse, sir.

585
01:01:58,246 --> 01:02:00,177
很好  最后一个呢
Very good. And the last one...

586
01:02:00,801 --> 01:02:03,105
也是最重要的一个
the most important one?

587
01:02:10,058 --> 01:02:13,978
没有从前两个中学到东西
Not learning from the first two.

588
01:02:15,102 --> 01:02:17,768
这是学校  你没有权利
This is a school, you've no right

589
01:02:18,018 --> 01:02:22,532
我是魔法执法部门的负责人  我有权利去任何我想去的地方
I'm the Head of Magical Law Enforcement and I have the right to go wherever I please.

590
01:02:24,231 --> 01:02:25,416
都出去
Out of here.

591
01:02:29,955 --> 01:02:32,218
请和麦格教授一起出去
Go with Professor McGonagall, please.

592
01:02:38,972 --> 01:02:40,479
他是我们最好的老师
He's the best teacher we've got.

593
01:02:40,479 --> 01:02:42,764
-谢谢  麦克拉根   -出去
- Thanks, McClaggan. - Get out!

594
01:02:42,766 --> 01:02:44,318
快来  麦克拉根
Come, McClaggan.

595
01:02:49,429 --> 01:02:51,624
纽特·斯卡曼德在巴黎
Newt Scamander is in Paris.

596
01:02:53,146 --> 01:02:54,012
真的
Really?

597
01:02:54,043 --> 01:02:56,579
别装了  我知道他是听你的命令来的
Cut the pretense. I know he's there on your orders.

598
01:02:56,580 --> 01:02:59,487
如果你有幸教过他的话
If you'd ever had the pleasure to teach him, you'd

599
01:02:59,511 --> 01:03:02,075
你就知道纽特不是一个听话的人
know Newt is not a great follower of orders.

600
01:03:04,721 --> 01:03:07,137
你读过第谷·多多斯的预言吗
You've read The Predictions of Tycho Dodonus??

601
01:03:07,163 --> 01:03:08,189
很多年前读过
Many years ago.

602
01:03:08,897 --> 01:03:13,418
"儿子被残忍放逐 女儿带着绝望归来"
"A son cruelly banished Despair of the daughter"

603
01:03:13,444 --> 01:03:14,556
-归来   -是的  我知道了
- Return. - Yes, I know it.

604
01:03:16,946 --> 01:03:20,023
有传言说这个预言指的是默默然
There's a rumor this prediction refers to the Obscurial.

605
01:03:20,681 --> 01:03:22,513
他们说格林德沃想要.
They say that Grindelwald wants.

606
01:03:22,539 --> 01:03:25,124
一个高贵的追随者  我听说过这个谣言
A highborn henchman. I've heard the rumor.

607
01:03:25,125 --> 01:03:30,686
然而  斯卡曼德出现在的地方默默然都待过  是为了保护他
And yet Scamander appears wherever the Obscurial goes, to protect him.

608
01:03:31,199 --> 01:03:35,907
与此同时  你已经建立了一个相当小型的国际联络网
Meanwhile you have built up quite a little network of international contacts.

609
01:03:35,908 --> 01:03:39,802
不管你监视我和我朋友多久了
However long you keep me and my friends under surveillance...

610
01:03:39,803 --> 01:03:43,102
你不会发现有针对你的阴谋的  崔佛斯
You're not going to discover plots against you, Travers.

611
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:46,561
因为我们的目的一样 打败格林德沃
Because we want the same thing: the defeat of Grindelwald.

612
01:03:49,668 --> 01:03:53,829
但我警告你  你的镇压和暴力政策
But I warn you, your policies of suppression and violence

613
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:56,284
会把支持者推到他怀里
are pushing supporters into his arms.

614
01:03:56,285 --> 01:03:58,403
我对你的警告不感兴趣
I'm not interested in your warnings!

615
01:04:00,714 --> 01:04:05,581
现在  我本不想说的  因为
Now, it pains me to say it, because

616
01:04:05,872 --> 01:04:07,083
好吧  我不喜欢你
Well, I don't like you.

617
01:04:09,254 --> 01:04:10,352
但是…
But...

618
01:04:12,426 --> 01:04:17,548
你是唯一和他一样的法师
you are the only wizard who is his equal.

619
01:04:19,979 --> 01:04:21,579
我需要你去对抗他
I need you to fight him.

620
01:04:27,283 --> 01:04:28,510
我不行
I cannot.

621
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:34,084
就因为这个吗
Because of this?

622
01:04:42,685 --> 01:04:45,477
你和格林德沃就像兄弟一样亲密
You and Grindelwald were as close as brothers.

623
01:04:46,738 --> 01:04:48,616
我们比兄弟更亲密
We were closer than brothers.

624
01:04:59,768 --> 01:05:01,810
你会和他对抗吗
Will you fight him?

625
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:05,393
我不能
I can't.

626
01:05:07,268 --> 01:05:09,018
那你就选择了你的一边
Then you have chosen your side.

627
01:05:12,352 --> 01:05:15,596
从现在开始  我将知道你施的每一个咒语
From now on, I shall know every spell you cast..

628
01:05:15,597 --> 01:05:16,780
我要加倍监视你
I'm doubling the watch on you

629
01:05:16,781 --> 01:05:19,965
你将不再教授黑魔法防御术
and you will no longer teach Defense Against the Dark Arts.

630
01:05:22,009 --> 01:05:23,977
莉塔在哪   我们要去巴黎
Where's Leta? We need to go to Paris!

631
01:05:30,102 --> 01:05:31,258
忒修斯
Theseus.

632
01:05:31,402 --> 01:05:35,614
忒修斯  如果格林德沃召集集会..
Theseus, if Grindelwald calls a rally...

633
01:05:35,906 --> 01:05:37,458
不要阻止他
don't try and break it up.

634
01:05:37,534 --> 01:05:39,832
别让崔佛斯派你去
Don't let Travers send you in there.

635
01:05:41,095 --> 01:05:42,983
如果你曾经信任过我的话
If you ever trusted me...

636
01:05:42,985 --> 01:05:46,039
忒修斯   忒修斯
Theseus! Theseus!

637
01:06:27,363 --> 01:06:29,364
即使是利斯特兰奇也让我觉得恶心
Even Lestranges makes me feel sick.

638
01:06:29,365 --> 01:06:31,179
你知道她每个假期都呆在这里
You know she stays here every vacation.

639
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:32,762
她的家人其实并不想要她回家
Her family don't actually want her home.

640
01:06:32,763 --> 01:06:34,591
我不怪他们  她太烦人了
I don't blame them, she's so annoying.

641
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:37,228
你上周见过她吗
- Did you see her last week? - Oscausi!

642
01:06:42,030 --> 01:06:44,856
麦格教授   莱斯特兰奇又干坏事了
Professor McGonagall! Lestrange has done it again!

643
01:06:44,857 --> 01:06:46,941
莱斯特兰奇 别跑了
Lestrange, stop running!

644
01:06:47,104 --> 01:06:50,834
-莱斯特兰奇 不听话的孩子   站住   -快给我回来
- Lestrange! Disobedient children! Stop! - She needs to come back!

645
01:06:50,835 --> 01:06:52,316
斯莱特林学院的耻辱
Shame on the House of Slytherin.

646
01:06:52,318 --> 01:06:54,344
一百分   两百
A hundred points! Two hundred!

647
01:06:54,345 --> 01:06:56,537
快回来  马上
Get back here, right now!

648
01:06:58,793 --> 01:07:03,594
站住 站住 回来
Stop! Stop it! Stop it! You stop it! Get back!

649
01:07:08,945 --> 01:07:11,258
教授  莱斯特兰奇  她太过分了
Miss, it was Lestrange. She's horrible!

650
01:07:20,693 --> 01:07:23,072
斯卡曼德...你为什么不收拾行李
Scamander... why aren't you packing?

651
01:07:23,072 --> 01:07:24,832
我不回家了
I'm not going home.

652
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:26,489
为什么不呢
Why not?

653
01:07:27,426 --> 01:07:28,497
它需要我
He needs me.

654
01:07:34,852 --> 01:07:36,602
它伤得很重
It was hurt.

655
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:44,689
这是什么
What is that?

656
01:07:45,803 --> 01:07:46,903
一只渡鸦
A raven chick.

657
01:07:48,518 --> 01:07:50,814
渡鸦不是你家族的象征吗
Isn't Raven your family emblem.

658
01:07:50,815 --> 01:07:52,001
是的
Yes it is.

659
01:08:05,066 --> 01:08:06,806
好吧  纽特
All right, Newt.

660
01:08:06,808 --> 01:08:08,908
勇敢点
Be brave.

661
01:08:12,956 --> 01:08:14,680
太不寻常了
That's an unusual one.

662
01:08:14,681 --> 01:08:19,652
那么  斯卡曼德先生最怕的是什么呢
So Mrs. Scamander fears what more than anything else in the world?

663
01:08:19,653 --> 01:08:22,403
必须在办公室工作  教授
Having to work in an office, sir.

664
01:08:23,188 --> 01:08:24,564
好吧  纽特
Go ahead, Newt.

665
01:08:27,879 --> 01:08:28,879
Riddikulus

666
01:08:29,078 --> 01:08:30,078
干得好
Well done.

667
01:08:31,194 --> 01:08:32,917
干得好   莉塔
Good job. Leta?

668
01:08:35,691 --> 01:08:37,103
这只是一个幻形怪
It's only a Boggart,

669
01:08:37,121 --> 01:08:38,936
不会伤害你的
it can't hurt you.

670
01:08:41,025 --> 01:08:43,253
所有人都害怕某些东西
Everyone's scared of something

671
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:46,693
我一直期待看她出丑
I've been looking forward to this.

672
01:09:31,169 --> 01:09:33,169
我不想谈这个
I don't want to talk about it!

673
01:09:49,147 --> 01:09:52,675
他们认识我  不然就躲起来
They know me, or they'd hide.

674
01:09:55,907 --> 01:09:59,657
它们只在有法杖的树上筑巢
They only nest in trees with wand quality wood,

675
01:10:00,594 --> 01:10:01,816
你知道吗
did you know that?

676
01:10:03,867 --> 01:10:06,445
他们的社会生活非常复杂
And they have very complex social lives.

677
01:10:07,973 --> 01:10:11,139
如果你观察他们足够长的时间  你就会意识到
If you watch them for long enough, you realize.

678
01:10:28,953 --> 01:10:30,258
你好  莉塔
Hello, Leta.

679
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:31,979
这是个惊喜吗
This is a surprise.

680
01:10:35,935 --> 01:10:37,102
没想到我会在教室里吗
Finding me in a classroom?

681
01:10:39,185 --> 01:10:40,735
我是个这么差的学生吗
Was I such a bad student?

682
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:42,998
相反  你是我最聪明的学生之一
On the contrary, you were one of my cleverest

683
01:10:42,999 --> 01:10:44,699
我说的差  不是愚蠢
I said bad, not stupid.

684
01:10:50,089 --> 01:10:52,096
不用回答了
Don't bother answering.

685
01:10:53,564 --> 01:10:56,397
-我知道你从来都不喜欢我  -你错了
- I know you never liked me.. - Well, you're wrong.

686
01:10:56,398 --> 01:10:58,076
我从没想过你是坏的
I never thought you bad.

687
01:10:58,077 --> 01:11:00,828
那么你就是个例外  其他人都这么觉得
You were alone, then. Everybody else did.

688
01:11:01,295 --> 01:11:02,312
他们是对的
And they were right.

689
01:11:03,901 --> 01:11:05,051
我是邪恶的
I was wicked.

690
01:11:06,169 --> 01:11:10,110
莉塔  我知道关于你弟弟考维斯的谣言你一定很痛苦
Leta, I know how painful the rumors about your brother Corvus must

691
01:11:10,136 --> 01:11:11,150
为了你
be for you.

692
01:11:11,175 --> 01:11:15,602
不  你不明白  除非你有个兄弟也死了
No, you don't. Not unless you had a brother who died too.

693
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:17,673
对我来说  死的是我妹妹
In my case, it was my sister.

694
01:11:20,967 --> 01:11:22,462
你爱她吗
Did you love her?

695
01:11:31,503 --> 01:11:33,499
我对她的关心不够多
Not as well as I should have done.

696
01:11:37,185 --> 01:11:39,102
释怀什么时候也不晚
Never too late to free yourself.

697
01:11:41,145 --> 01:11:46,491
我听说忏悔是一种解脱  能如释重负
Confession is a relief, I'm told. A great weight lifted.

698
01:11:49,667 --> 01:11:51,908
后悔是我永远的伴侣
Regret is my constant companion.

699
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:54,824
别让它占据了你
Do not let it become yours.

700
01:12:05,157 --> 01:12:07,264
不用了  谢谢
Oh No, thank you.

701
01:12:07,853 --> 01:12:11,532
你人真好  但是.
Well, you've been real kind, but...

702
01:12:11,533 --> 01:12:16,653
我姐姐蒂娜可能很担心我
my sister Tina's probably worried sick about me...

703
01:12:16,654 --> 01:12:19,092
你知道的  她会疯狂敲门找我的
you know, banging on all the doors and things...

704
01:12:20,504 --> 01:12:21,916
所以我想  我最好还是告辞吧
so I think I'd better be going.

705
01:12:21,916 --> 01:12:24,184
但你还没见过这里的男主人呢
But you haven't met your host.

706
01:12:24,185 --> 01:12:25,632
哦  你结婚了吗
Oh, are you married?

707
01:12:26,930 --> 01:12:31,062
不如是说...五体投地
Let's say... deeply committed.

708
01:12:33,514 --> 01:12:36,500
你看  我不知道你是不是在开玩笑
You see, I can't tell if you're making a joke

709
01:12:37,964 --> 01:12:39,435
或是你们法国人就这样
or if you're just... French.

710
01:12:48,991 --> 01:12:51,784
嘿  别闹了
Hey, knock it off.

711
01:12:59,397 --> 01:13:00,478
你就呆在那里
You stay right there.

712
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,280
我知道你是什么人
I know what you are.

713
01:13:03,522 --> 01:13:04,606
奎妮
Quennie.

714
01:13:06,435 --> 01:13:08,200
我们不是来伤害你的
We are not here to hurt you.

715
01:13:09,274 --> 01:13:10,935
我们只想帮你
We only want to help you.

716
01:13:12,411 --> 01:13:15,185
你离家太远了  太远了
You're so very, very far from home.

717
01:13:15,994 --> 01:13:20,369
远离你所爱的一切  离开那个舒服地方
Far away from everything you love. Everything that was comfortable.

718
01:13:22,582 --> 01:13:26,496
我永远不会让你受到伤害  永远不会
I would never see you harmed, ever.

719
01:13:28,619 --> 01:13:32,275
你姐姐是傲罗  不是你的错
It is not your fault that your sister is an Auror.

720
01:13:34,366 --> 01:13:38,500
我真希望你现在能和我们在一起
I wish you were working with me now towards a

721
01:13:38,524 --> 01:13:42,836
创建一个公开的法师世界
world where we wizards are free to live openly,

722
01:13:43,615 --> 01:13:46,098
去自由地爱
and to love freely.

723
01:13:57,719 --> 01:13:59,278
你是无辜的
You are an innocent.

724
01:14:01,626 --> 01:14:03,227
所以现在走吧
So go now.

725
01:14:05,166 --> 01:14:06,269
离开这里
Leave this place.

726
01:15:29,721 --> 01:15:32,358
嘿  纽特  伙计
Hey, Newt, buddy.

727
01:15:33,545 --> 01:15:36,453
蒂娜在上面  她看起来满寂寞的
Tina's up here. She's all by her lonesome

728
01:15:36,454 --> 01:15:39,006
或许你能过来陪着她
and maybe you want to come up and keep her company?

729
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:44,577
我在找吃的  但什么也没找到  所以  我想我
I've been looking for food, and I ain't found any. So, I guess I'm

730
01:15:44,602 --> 01:15:48,837
上楼去试试我的运气 也许阁楼会有东西
gonna go upstairs and try my luck in the-I dunno-the attic!

731
01:15:49,823 --> 01:15:53,185
你会没事的
You're all right. Relaxio.

732
01:15:58,992 --> 01:15:59,997
好吧
Okay.

733
01:16:12,699 --> 01:16:14,665
用了白藓 它的反应还不错
She's responded well to the Dittany.

734
01:16:15,666 --> 01:16:17,956
你看  它天生就是跑步的料
She was born to run, you see.

735
01:16:18,461 --> 01:16:21,404
我觉得它只是缺乏自信
I think she's just lacking in confidence

736
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:26,443
斯卡曼德先生  你的箱子里有什么能让他起死回生的东西吗
Mr. Scamander, have you got anything in your case that might help revive this man?

737
01:16:26,444 --> 01:16:27,818
我需要问他一些问题
I need to question him.

738
01:16:27,819 --> 01:16:29,496
我想他知道克雷登斯的真实身份
I think he knows who Credence really is.

739
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,580
他手上的伤疤表明他的誓言牢不可破
The scars on his hand suggest an unbreakable vow...

740
01:16:31,581 --> 01:16:35,269
-牢不可破的誓言   -牢不可破的誓言  我也注意到了
- an unbreakable vow. - Unbreakable vow. I noticed that too.

741
01:16:45,435 --> 01:16:46,693
Lumos

742
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:55,080
那是什么
What was that?

743
01:16:55,084 --> 01:16:57,407
在下水道里一定有一条水龙
There must be a water dragon in that sewer

744
01:16:59,008 --> 01:17:01,453
它们携带着这些寄生虫  你看  他们…
they carry these parasites, you see. They...

745
01:17:02,148 --> 01:17:03,932
-雅各布   -干嘛
- Jacob? - Yeah?

746
01:17:05,617 --> 01:17:08,796
在我箱子的那个口袋里  你会找到一把镊子
In my case, in the pocket there, you'll find a pair of tweezers.

747
01:17:08,821 --> 01:17:09,880
镊子
Tweezers?

748
01:17:10,121 --> 01:17:12,649
-它们又薄又尖  -又薄又尖的东西
- They're thin and pointy... - Thin, little pointy things.

749
01:17:12,650 --> 01:17:14,371
是的  我知道镊子是什么
Yes, I know what tweezers are.

750
01:17:17,386 --> 01:17:19,324
你可能不想看这个场景
You might not want to watch this...

751
01:17:19,469 --> 01:17:20,833
没事的
I can handle it.

752
01:17:25,863 --> 01:17:27,200
来吧
Come on.

753
01:17:27,616 --> 01:17:29,512
来吧
Come on.

754
01:17:30,198 --> 01:17:31,726
哦  别这样
Oh come on.

755
01:17:33,741 --> 01:17:35,617
雅各布  你能帮我拿一下吗
Jacob, will you take that for me?

756
01:17:38,852 --> 01:17:40,698
挺像章鱼的
Calamari..

757
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,589
我必须杀了他
I must kill him.

758
01:17:44,957 --> 01:17:45,957
谁
Who?

759
01:17:46,214 --> 01:17:47,329
克雷登斯
Credence?

760
01:17:48,913 --> 01:17:52,964
他可能需要几个小时才能康复  寄生虫的毒性很强
It may take him a few hours to recover. The parasite's poison is quite strong.

761
01:17:54,621 --> 01:17:56,933
我要带着我所有发现的东西回魔法部去
I'll have to go back to the Ministry with what I've got.

762
01:17:58,978 --> 01:18:00,736
很高兴再次见到你  斯卡曼德先生
It was nice to see you again, Mr. Scamander.

763
01:18:00,737 --> 01:18:04,018
嘿  等一下  好吗  等等
Hey, hold on one second, will you? Well, hold on!

764
01:18:04,424 --> 01:18:06,274
等等   蒂娜
Wait! Tina!

765
01:18:10,958 --> 01:18:12,663
你没说什么火蜥蜴吧
You didn't mention salamanders, did you?

766
01:18:12,664 --> 01:18:15,389
没说  她就是这么走了  我不知道..
No, she just ran. I don't know...

767
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:17,796
所以你就去追她啊
So you chase after her!

768
01:18:18,768 --> 01:18:21,353
蒂娜  拜托  听我说
Tina. Please, just listen to me-

769
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:25,413
斯卡曼德先生  我要去和魔法部的人谈谈
Mr. Scamander, I need to go talk to the Ministry.

770
01:18:25,820 --> 01:18:27,815
我知道你对傲罗的态度
And I know how you feel about Aurors.

771
01:18:27,816 --> 01:18:30,860
我在信中表达自己的方式可能有点强硬
I may have been a little strong in the way that I expressed myself in that letters.

772
01:18:30,861 --> 01:18:34,020
那个的短语是怎么说来着   一群装腔作势的伪君子
What was the exact phrase? “A bunch of careerist hypocrites?

773
01:18:34,021 --> 01:18:35,847
我很抱歉  但我不喜欢别人
I'm sorry, but I can't admire people

774
01:18:35,848 --> 01:18:38,988
他们害怕或误解的一切问题的答案就是扼杀它
whose answer to everything that they fear or misunderstand is kill it?

775
01:18:38,990 --> 01:18:40,382
我是个傲罗  我不是那样的人
I'm an Auror and I don't...

776
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:42,586
那是因为你是中间的那个头
Yes, and that's because you've gone middle head!

777
01:18:43,845 --> 01:18:44,999
你说什么
Excuse me?

778
01:18:45,437 --> 01:18:48,276
这是一个来自一个三个头的如尼纹蛇说法
It's an expression derived from the three heads of the Runespoor.

779
01:18:48,301 --> 01:18:49,610
中间那个代表幻想者
The middle one is a visionary.

780
01:18:49,611 --> 01:18:54,237
除了你  欧洲的每一个傲罗都希望克雷登斯死掉  你现在就是中间那个头
Every Auror in Europe wants Credence dead-except you. You've gone middle head.

781
01:18:55,125 --> 01:18:58,451
现在谁会用这个词呢  斯卡曼德先生
Who else uses that expression, Mr. Scamander?

782
01:18:59,404 --> 01:19:00,910
我想可能只有我吧
I think it might just be me.

783
01:19:19,278 --> 01:19:22,068
是格林德沃  他在召唤追随者
It's Grindelwald. He's calling his followers.

784
01:19:50,268 --> 01:19:51,768
太迟了
It's too late.

785
01:19:51,778 --> 01:19:53,966
格林德沃来找克雷登斯了
Grindelwald's come for Credence.

786
01:19:55,525 --> 01:19:56,854
他可能已经抓到他了
He might already have him.

787
01:19:56,855 --> 01:20:00,136
现在还不算太晚  我们还是可以先找到他的
It's not too late. We can still get to him first.

788
01:20:02,376 --> 01:20:03,960
你要去哪里
Where are you going?

789
01:20:03,961 --> 01:20:05,524
法国魔法部
The French Ministry of Magic.

790
01:20:05,554 --> 01:20:07,759
那是克雷登斯最不愿意去的地方
That's the last place Credence would go!

791
01:20:07,761 --> 01:20:09,958
在蒂娜部门藏着一个盒子
There's a box hidden at the Ministry Tina.

792
01:20:09,982 --> 01:20:12,615
这是一个可以告诉我们克雷登斯是谁的盒子
It's a box that can tell us who Credence really is.

793
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:14,940
盒子   你在说什么
A box? What are you talking about?

794
01:20:14,941 --> 01:20:16,642
相信我
Trust me.

795
01:20:19,925 --> 01:20:23,160
你想出来吗   就一会儿
You wanna come out? Just for a little while?

796
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:34,130
克雷斯登
Credence.

797
01:20:37,935 --> 01:20:43,087
-嘘   -你想要什么
- Shh. - What do you want?

798
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:44,831
从你那里吗
From you?

799
01:20:45,479 --> 01:20:46,645
什么都不要
Nothing.

800
01:20:49,288 --> 01:20:51,342
但我有东西给你
For you?

801
01:20:52,625 --> 01:20:54,830
我从未拥有的一切
Everything I never had.

802
01:20:55,299 --> 01:20:58,606
但你想要什么  我的孩子
But what is it you want, my boy?

803
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:00,962
我想知道我是谁
I want to know who I am.

804
01:21:10,768 --> 01:21:16,435
在这里你会找到你真实身份的证据
This is where you will find proof of your true identity.

805
01:21:20,779 --> 01:21:25,067
今晚来拉雪兹公墓  你会发现真相的
Come to Père Lachaise tonight and you will discover the truth.

806
01:21:43,102 --> 01:21:45,750
父亲  你为什么要这么对我
Father... why did you make me ...?

807
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:48,708
等等
Wait!

808
01:21:50,185 --> 01:21:51,560
等等
Wait!

809
01:22:13,227 --> 01:22:15,994
恐怕我们家里没有食物了
I'm afraid we keep no food in the house.

810

你是鬼吗
Are you a ghost?

811
01:22:19,823 --> 01:22:23,662
不  不  我是活人
No, no, I am alive,

812
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:27,821
但我是炼金术士  所以我是不朽的
but I am an alchemist, and therefore immortal.

813
01:22:29,627 --> 01:22:32,310
你看起来一点也不像三十七十五岁以上的人
You don't look a day over three-seventy-five.

814
01:22:35,163 --> 01:22:37,000
嘿  抱歉我们没敲门

821
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:56,440

There was this dame there, and she had a veil.. I gave her a nickel and

826

她告诉我  我的未来
she told me about my future.

827
01:23:19,777 --> 01:23:23,056
实际上她算的实在是差太多了
And she missed out on quite a bit actually.

828
01:23:28,962 --> 01:23:31,283
等等   我认识他  是那个孩子  那是克雷登斯
Wait a minute! I know him. That's that kid. That's Credence

829
01:23:34,515 --> 01:23:35,684

我有两百年没用过了
I haven't seen action in two hundred years...

845

They think that Credence boy might be your missing brother.

859
01:25:33,422 --> 01:25:36,000

- My brother is dead. He died.. - I know. I know.

860

- don't we run the risk of adding to the. - Just do it.

I don't suppose you can Disapparate on Ministry premises in France, can you?

868
01:26:15,676 --> 01:26:16,775
不行
No.

它们不是猫

01:34:25,055 --> 01:34:26,072
好了
Come on.

944
01:34:28,934 --> 01:34:31,012
好吧  好吧
All right. All right.

945
01:34:33,618 --> 01:34:34,777
等等
Wait.

946
01:34:49,171 --> 01:34:50,474
后退
Move back!

947
01:34:50,475 --> 01:34:52,074
走开   别挡道
Move! Out of the way!

948
01:34:54,001 --> 01:34:57,439
如果你在找克雷登斯  我也是
If you are looking for Credence, me too.

949
01:34:57,603 --> 01:34:58,695
住手
Stop!

950
01:35:02,997 --> 01:35:04,122
尤瑟夫
Yusuf?

951
01:35:05,346 --> 01:35:06,623
真的是你吗
Is that really you?

952
01:35:13,170 --> 01:35:14,563
我妹妹
My little sister .?

953
01:35:17,353 --> 01:35:19,070
所以  他是你哥哥
So, he's your brother?

954
01:35:21,057 --> 01:35:22,381
我是谁
Who am I?

955
01:35:23,788 --> 01:35:24,715
我不知道
I don't know.

956
01:35:24,716 --> 01:35:27,966
我厌倦了没有名字没有不知道身事的生活了
I'm tired of living with no name and no history.

957
01:35:30,279 --> 01:35:33,041
告诉我我的故事  然后你就可以来个了结了
Just tell me my story-then you can end it.

958
01:35:33,141 --> 01:35:34,939
你的故事就是我们的故事
Your story is our story.

959
01:35:38,582 --> 01:35:40,100
我们的故事
Our story.

960
01:35:40,324 --> 01:35:41,768
不  尤瑟夫
No, Yusuf.

961
01:35:58,198 --> 01:36:00,585
我父亲是马斯塔法卡玛
My father was Mustafa Kama.

962
01:36:01,132 --> 01:36:04,962
纯正的塞内加尔血统  成就斐然
A pure-blood of Sénégalese descent and most accomplished.

963
01:36:05,854 --> 01:36:08,757
我妈妈  劳伦娜
My mother, Laurena,

964
01:36:09,153 --> 01:36:12,229
同样是高贵的一个著名的美人
was equally high-bred-a noted beauty.

965
01:36:13,136 --> 01:36:15,162
他们深爱着对方
They were deeply in love.

966
01:36:16,737 --> 01:36:21,876
他们认识一个很有影响的人  他来自法国一个著名的纯正血统家庭
They knew a man of great influence, from a famous French pure-blood family.

967
01:36:23,014 --> 01:36:25,122
他渴望她
He desired her.

968
01:36:28,993 --> 01:36:33,561
莱斯特兰奇用咒语引诱并诱拐她
Lestrange used the Imperius Curse to seduce and abduct her.

969
01:36:34,787 --> 01:36:37,639
我试图阻止  但他攻击了我
I tried to prevent it but he attacked me.

970
01:36:39,095 --> 01:36:41,439
那是我最后一次见到她
That was the last time I ever saw her.

971
01:36:43,768 --> 01:36:47,333
她死了  生了一个小女孩
She died, giving birth to a little girl.

972
01:36:48,404 --> 01:36:49,671
就是你
You.

973
01:36:53,378 --> 01:36:57,096
她去世的消息使我父亲发疯了
The news of her death drove my father insane.

974
01:36:58,153 --> 01:37:04,342
我父亲奄奄一息的时候还要我寻求报复
With his dying breath, my father charged me to seek revenge.

975
01:37:06,505 --> 01:37:10,103
杀了这个世界上莱斯特兰奇最爱的人
Kill the person Lestrange loves best in the world.

976
01:37:10,229 --> 01:37:12,162
我以为一开始会很容易
I thought at first it would be easy.

977
01:37:12,936 --> 01:37:15,015
他只有一个近亲
He had only one close relative

978
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:17,060
就是你
You.

979
01:37:17,476 --> 01:37:18,054
但是…
But...

980
01:37:18,125 --> 01:37:19,134
说出来
Say it.

981
01:37:20,976 --> 01:37:23,077
他从来没有爱过你
He never loved you.

982
01:37:26,957 --> 01:37:31,020
她死后不到三个月他就再婚了
He remarried not three months after her death.

983
01:37:33,476 --> 01:37:36,172
他对她的爱不亚于他对你的爱
He loved her no more than he had loved you

984
01:37:40,025 --> 01:37:41,271
但后来
But then...

985
01:37:41,273 --> 01:37:44,202
他的儿子考维斯终于出生了
his son, Corvus, was born at last.

986
01:37:44,756 --> 01:37:47,793
还有那个素未谋面的人
And that man who had never known...

987
01:37:47,847 --> 01:37:49,692
它充满了爱
love was filled with it.

988
01:37:49,893 --> 01:37:53,778
他只关心他的考维斯
All he cared about was little Corvus.

989
01:37:57,264 --> 01:37:58,979
所以..就是这样
So... this is the truth?

990
01:38:00,350 --> 01:38:02,287
我是考维斯莱斯特兰奇
I am Corvus Lestrange?

991
01:38:03,090 --> 01:38:04,287
-是的   -不是
- Yes. - No.

992
01:38:04,729 --> 01:38:08,070
意识到马斯塔法卡玛的儿子发誓要复仇
Realizing that Mustafa Kama's son had sworn revenge,

993
01:38:08,072 --> 01:38:11,213
你父亲想把你藏在我找不到你的地方
your father sought to hide you where I couldn't find you.

994
01:38:11,676 --> 01:38:16,354
所以他把你托付给了他的仆人  他的仆人上了一艘开往美国的船
So he confided you to his servant, who boarded a ship for America.

995
01:38:16,354 --> 01:38:19,730
-他确实把考维斯送到了美国  但是  -他的仆人伊玛杜加德
- He did send Corvus to America, but... - His servant, Irma Dugard,

996
01:38:19,731 --> 01:38:21,324
是个半精灵
was a half-elf...

997
01:38:21,326 --> 01:38:23,000
她的魔法很弱
Her magic was weak and

998
01:38:23,002 --> 01:38:25,939
所以没有留下任何蛛丝马迹
therefore left no trace I could follow,

999
01:38:27,042 --> 01:38:30,508
我刚刚才发现你是怎么逃出来的
I had only just discovered how you had escaped

1000
01:38:30,510 --> 01:38:33,459
当我收到我从没想过的消息时
when I received news I never expected.

1001
01:38:33,461 --> 01:38:36,389
那艘船在海上沉没了
The ship had gone down at sea.

1002
01:38:36,725 --> 01:38:38,350
但你活下来了  不是吗
But you survived, didn't you?

1003
01:38:39,542 --> 01:38:42,703
不知怎的  有人把你从水里拉出来了
Somehow, someone had pulled you from the water!

1004
01:38:43,599 --> 01:38:46,354
儿子被残忍放逐  女儿带着绝望归来
A son cruelly banished Despair of the daughter.

1005
01:38:46,354 --> 01:38:49,601
回归  伟大的复仇者啊  扇动翅膀  从水中而来
Return, great avenger with wings from the water.

1006
01:38:49,603 --> 01:38:52,090
绝望的女儿站在那里
There, stands the despairing daughter.

1007
01:38:52,256 --> 01:38:56,032
你是从海上回来的有翅膀的渡鸦
You are the winged raven returned from the sea,

1008
01:38:56,033 --> 01:39:00,007
但我  我是家族毁灭的复仇者
 but I, I am the avenger of my family's ruin.

1009
01:39:02,613 --> 01:39:03,768
我很同情你  考维斯
I pity you, Corvus,

1010
01:39:05,768 --> 01:39:06,893
但你必须死
but you must die.

1011
01:39:07,238 --> 01:39:10,292
考维斯 莱斯特兰奇已经死了  我杀了他
Corvus Lestrange is already dead. I killed him.

1012
01:39:17,393 --> 01:39:18,393
Accio.

1013
01:39:35,795 --> 01:39:39,011
我父亲有一棵很奇怪的家谱
My father owned a very strange family tree.

1014
01:39:42,497 --> 01:39:44,634
它只记录男性
It only recorded the men...

1015
01:39:48,626 --> 01:39:51,466
我家里的女人被记作花
The women in my family were recorded as flowers.

1016
01:39:54,315 --> 01:39:55,398
很漂亮
Beautiful.

1017
01:39:57,875 --> 01:39:58,946
也很孤独
Separate.

1018
01:40:01,557 --> 01:40:03,997
我父亲把我送到了美国  跟着考维斯...
My father sent me to America, along Corvus..

1019
01:40:09,951 --> 01:40:13,498
伊尔玛要装扮成有两个孙子的祖母
Irma was to pose as a grandmother with two grandchildren...

1020
01:40:18,433 --> 01:40:21,473
考维斯一直哭个不停
Corvus never stopped crying.

1021
01:40:39,477 --> 01:40:41,103
我从没想过要伤害他
I never wanted to hurt him.

1022
01:40:46,854 --> 01:40:49,060
我只想摆脱他
I only wanted to be free of him

1023
01:40:49,311 --> 01:40:51,310
就一会儿
Just for a moment.

1024
01:40:56,310 --> 01:40:58,310
就那么小会儿
Just a single moment.

1025
01:41:08,643 --> 01:41:10,143
他们要我们穿上救生衣
They want us to put on life jackets!

1026
01:42:09,101 --> 01:42:11,676
你不是故意的  莉塔
You didn't mean to do it, Leta.

1027
01:42:13,824 --> 01:42:15,200
所以这不是你的错
So it wasn't your fault.

1028
01:42:18,352 --> 01:42:19,458
哦  纽特
Oh, Newt.

1029
01:42:23,726 --> 01:42:26,755
你从没见过你不喜欢的怪物
You never met a monster you couldn't love.

1030
01:42:31,184 --> 01:42:35,206
莉塔  你知道克雷登斯是谁吗
Leta, do you know who Credence really is?

1031
01:42:36,686 --> 01:42:39,526
你知道吗  当你换他的时候
Did you know, when you swapped him?

1032
01:42:39,528 --> 01:42:40,907
不知道
No.

1033
01:43:03,542 --> 01:43:06,022
奎妮
Queenie?

1034
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:32,812
他们是纯种的法师
They're pure-bloods.

1035
01:43:33,512 --> 01:43:35,676
他们为了玩来杀了我们这样的人
They kill the likes of us for sport!

1036
01:43:38,575 --> 01:43:40,194
-奎妮   -雅各布
- Quennie. - Jacob.

1037
01:43:40,576 --> 01:43:42,951
宝贝  你来了
Honey, you're here! Hi!

1038
01:43:42,952 --> 01:43:44,140
嗨  亲爱的  不要这样
Hi, dear, do not.

1039
01:43:44,962 --> 01:43:47,216
哦  亲爱的  我很抱歉
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry,

1040
01:43:47,219 --> 01:43:49,472
我不该这么做的  我太爱你了
I never should have done it, I love you so much.

1041
01:43:49,473 --> 01:43:51,810
-你也知道我爱你  对吧   -是的
- And you know that I love you, right? - Yeah.

1042
01:43:51,811 --> 01:43:55,310
-很好  现在让我们离开这里吧   -噢  等等  等等
- Good, now let's get the hell out of here. - Oh, wait. Wait a second.

1043
01:43:57,810 --> 01:44:00,751
我只是想也许我们能先听听他到底要说什么
I just thought maybe we could hear him first.

1044
01:44:00,752 --> 01:44:03,474
只是听听  就这样
You know, just listen, that's all.

1045
01:44:04,439 --> 01:44:05,841
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

1046
01:44:10,976 --> 01:44:12,342
这是个陷阱
It's a trap.

1047
01:44:12,692 --> 01:44:13,745
是啊
Yeah.

1048
01:44:14,937 --> 01:44:18,997
奎妮  那棵家谱  全是诱饵
Queenie-the family tree-it's all been bait.

1049
01:44:20,073 --> 01:44:22,386
我们得想办法离开这里  马上
We have to find a way out of here, right now

1050
01:44:23,672 --> 01:44:25,293
你去找其他人
You go find the others.

1051
01:44:25,435 --> 01:44:26,535
你要怎么做
What are you gonna do?

1052
01:44:27,195 --> 01:44:28,278
我想想办法
I'll think of something.

1053
01:45:17,117 --> 01:45:22,747
我的兄弟们  我的姐妹们  我的朋友们
My brothers, my sisters, my friends:

1054
01:45:24,204 --> 01:45:28,154
你们的掌声不是给我的
the great gift of your applause is not for me...

1055
01:45:29,068 --> 01:45:30,854
是给你自己的
No. It is for yourselves.

1056
01:45:33,636 --> 01:45:36,032
你们今天来是因为渴望
You came today because of a craving

1057
01:45:37,353 --> 01:45:39,102
以及想了解更多
and a knowledge

1058
01:45:40,852 --> 01:45:44,291
旧的方式不再适合我们
that the old ways serve us no longer.

1059
01:45:47,064 --> 01:45:51,174
你今天来是因为你渴望新的东西
You come today because you crave something new.

1060
01:45:52,768 --> 01:45:54,518
一些不同的东西
Something different.

1061
01:45:56,793 --> 01:46:02,786
据说我讨厌麻鸡
It is said that I hate Les Non-Magiques,

1062
01:46:02,787 --> 01:46:04,325
麻瓜
The Muggle.

1063
01:46:04,409 --> 01:46:05,759
麻鸡
The No-Maj.

1064
01:46:07,310 --> 01:46:08,561
施不了咒的人
The Can't-Spells.

1065
01:46:11,061 --> 01:46:14,558
我不恨他们  我一点也不恨
I do not hate them. I do not.

1066
01:46:16,768 --> 01:46:18,551
因为我不为仇恨而战
For I do not fight out of hatred.

1067
01:46:21,264 --> 01:46:27,185
我说麻瓜不是少数群体
I say the Muggles are not lesser, but other.

1068
01:46:27,935 --> 01:46:32,187
不是毫无价值  而是有其他价值
Not worthless, but of other value.

1069
01:46:34,102 --> 01:46:36,819
不能任意处理他们
Not disposable,

1070
01:46:36,820 --> 01:46:39,204
但却应该被区别对待
but of a different disposition.

1071
01:46:39,352 --> 01:46:42,735
魔法的绽放
Magic blooms

1072
01:46:42,736 --> 01:46:46,298
只有在稀有的灵魂里才行
only in rare souls.

1073
01:46:53,358 --> 01:46:57,327
哦  为了全人类  我们能创造一个怎样的世界
Oh, and what a world we could make, for all of humanity...

1074
01:46:57,328 --> 01:47:01,157
我们这些为自由而活的人
We who live for freedom,

1075
01:47:01,158 --> 01:47:02,592
为了真相
for truth.

1076
01:47:04,568 --> 01:47:06,521
为了爱
And for love.

1077
01:47:16,424 --> 01:47:18,303
他们在这里进行非法集会
It isn't illegal to listen to him!

1078
01:47:19,249 --> 01:47:21,526
尽量不要使用武力
Use minimum of force on the crowd.

1079
01:47:22,856 --> 01:47:24,749
我们不能像他说的那样
We mustn't be what he says we are!

1080
01:47:30,732 --> 01:47:35,230
现在是分享我对未来的展望的时候了
The moment has come to share my vision of the future.

1081
01:47:36,931 --> 01:47:40,168
如果我们不起义
That awaits if we do not rise up

1082
01:47:42,115 --> 01:47:46,651
占据我们在世界上应有的位置
and take our rightful place in the world.

1083
01:48:30,942 --> 01:48:32,806
不要在开战了
Not another war.

1084
01:48:38,283 --> 01:48:41,979
这就是我们要起义的理由
That is what we are fighting!

1085
01:48:43,046 --> 01:48:44,699
那是我们的敌人
That is the enemy.

1086
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:47,941
他们傲慢
Their arrogance.

1087
01:48:49,098 --> 01:48:50,938
他们渴望权力
Their power lust.

1088
01:48:53,150 --> 01:48:54,813
他们野蛮
Their barbarity.

1089
01:48:56,436 --> 01:49:00,626
用不了多久 他们就会把矛头指向我们
How long will it take before they turn their weapons on us?

1090
01:49:02,625 --> 01:49:05,434
当我说到这个的时候什么也不要做
Do nothing when I speak of this.

1091
01:49:05,799 --> 01:49:07,837
你必须保持冷静
You must remain calm

1092
01:49:10,159 --> 01:49:12,017
控制你的情绪
and contain your emotions.

1093
01:49:16,342 --> 01:49:18,571
我们中间有傲罗
There are Aurors here among us.

1094
01:49:28,646 --> 01:49:31,536
走近点  法师兄弟   加入我们

1096
01:49:35,589 --> 01:49:36,809
不要用武力
No force.

1097
01:49:52,582 --> 01:49:55,613
他们杀了我的很多追随者

1098
01:49:56,023 --> 01:49:57,536
这是真的
It is true.

1099
01:49:59,102 --> 01:50:03,270
他们把我关在纽约折磨我
They confined me tortured me in New York.

1100
01:50:04,699 --> 01:50:09,682
他们扼杀了他们的法师同伴
They had struck down their fellow witches and wizards...

1101
01:50:10,478 --> 01:50:15,850
只是因为他简单的去寻求真理
For the simple crime of seeking the truth.

1102
01:50:16,866 --> 01:50:18,401
因为我想要自由
For wanting freedom...

1103
01:50:23,304 --> 01:50:26,948
你的愤怒  有报复的欲望是很自然的

1104
01:50:30,562 --> 01:50:33,803
不

1105
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:06,518
带这位年轻的战士回到她的家人身边

1106
01:51:14,102 --> 01:51:17,965
消失吧  离开这里  从这里出发
Disapparate. Leave. Go forth from

1107
01:51:17,991 --> 01:51:21,602
把这里发生的事情散布出去吧
this place and spread the word.

1108
01:51:22,685 --> 01:51:26,029
我们没有使用任何暴力
It is not we who are violent.

1109
01:52:14,425 --> 01:52:18,395
傲罗  穿过火焰 加入我的圈子

1110
01:52:19,963 --> 01:52:24,333
向我保证你永远对我忠诚

1111

要么就去死

1112
01:52:26,528 --> 01:52:29,014
只有在这里你才会知道什么是自由
Only here shall you know freedom.

1113
01:52:29,015 --> 01:52:32,069
只有在这里你才能了解你自己

1114
01:52:39,321 --> 01:52:40,930
循规蹈矩
Play by the rules.

1115
01:52:40,931 --> 01:52:42,987
孩子们  不要作弊

1116

他知道我是谁

1117
01:52:50,474 --> 01:52:54,201
他只是的知道你的出身  但不知道你的为人
He knows what you were born, not who you are...

1118
01:52:54,202 --> 01:52:56,202
克雷登斯
Credence!

1119
01:53:10,330 --> 01:53:12,544
奎妮  你得醒醒
Queenie. You gotta wake up!

1120
01:53:14,229 --> 01:53:17,462
雅各布  他就是答案

1121
01:53:17,889 --> 01:53:20,181
-他的想法就是我们一直想要的   -不  不  不

这一切都是为了你  克雷登斯

受到所有法师的鄙视

我觉得最好还是让他们单独谈谈吧
I think it's best if he speaks to him alone.

1155

他还害怕我吗

你得小心点

这是个血盟  对吧
It's a blood pact, isn't it?

1164

你们发过誓不对抗彼此的
You swore not to fight each other.

1165
02:02:26,666 --> 02:02:28,959
以梅林的名义你是怎么搞到的
How in the name of Merlin did you manage to get?

格林德沃似乎不理解他认为简单的事物的本质
Grindelwald doesn't seem to understand the nature of things he considers simple...

它想要喝点牛奶

记得把茶匙藏起来

你遭受了你的亲人
You have suffered the most heinous of betrayals,

1174
02:03:25,458 --> 02:03:29,673
故意给你的最十恶不赦的背叛

你的兄弟想毁了你

最需要的它地方
who is in dire need.

1180
02:04:16,519 --> 02:04:18,671
这是你与生俱来的权利  我的孩子

1181
02:04:23,264 --> 02:04:25,403
