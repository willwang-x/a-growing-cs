1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000

2
00:00:03,307 --> 00:00:07,533
<font color=#B5A642>-=cece&飞飞字幕组荣誉出品，谨以此字幕致以亲爱的西西宝贝</font>

<font color=#B5A642>-=cece&飞飞字幕组=-制作:飞飞校对:西西宝贝720p版本调教：Tears</font>

4
00:00:12,898 --> 00:00:14,176
OK，我们说到哪儿了？
OK, where was I?

5
00:00:14,451 --> 00:00:15,732
你在跟我们说你和妈妈是怎么认识的
You were telling us how you met mom

6
00:00:15,733 --> 00:00:17,175
而且真是折腾人的细节化
and that excruciating detail.

7
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:20,973
没错，要回溯到2005年,我还是27岁的时候
Right. So back in 2005 when I was 27

8
00:00:20,974 --> 00:00:22,692
我最好的两个朋友订婚了
my two best friends got engaged.

9
00:00:23,264 --> 00:00:25,299
这触动了我，也许我也该结婚了
And that got me thinking. Maybe I should get married.

10
00:00:25,844 --> 00:00:27,329
这时我看见了Robin
And then I saw Robin.

11
00:00:27,952 --> 00:00:29,108
她真是太美了
She was incredible.

12
00:00:29,506 --> 00:00:30,598
我打心底里想要认识她
I just knew I had to meet her.

13
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:32,812
于是你们的Barney叔叔出现了
That's where your uncle Barney came in.

14
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,971
我提议玩一个游戏，我愿意称之为……
I suggest we play a little game I'd like to call

15
00:00:34,972 --> 00:00:36,449
“你见过Ted没有”
'have you met Ted?'

16
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,096
什么，不，我们不玩这游戏
No, we are not playing 'have you met Ted.'

17
00:00:38,097 --> 00:00:39,104
嗨，你见过Ted没有？
Hi, have you met Ted?

18
00:00:41,127 --> 00:00:42,174
接着我们约会了
So I asked her out.

19
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:43,790
我知道这听起来有点疯狂……
And I know that sounds crazy,

20
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:46,122
但只经过了一次约会abc我就爱上她了
but just after one date, I was in love with her.

21
00:00:46,466 --> 00:00:47,796
也让我说了一句不该说的话……
which made me say something stupid.

22
00:00:48,038 --> 00:00:49,401
我想我爱上你了
I think I'm in love with you.

23
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:50,281
什么？
What?

24
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:51,614
哦，老爸……
Oh, dad!

25
00:00:52,714 --> 00:00:53,623
然后怎么样了？
So then, what happened?

26
00:00:54,524 --> 00:00:55,201
什么也没发生
Nothing.

27
00:00:55,786 --> 00:00:57,703
我是说，我那一次实在太笨了
I mean, I'd made a complete fool of myself.

28
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:01,142
所以那次之后，我决定不再给她打电话了
So a week went by, and I decided not to call her.

29
00:01:01,143 --> 00:01:02,545
这么说你不打算给她打电话了
So you're not going to call her?

30
00:01:02,866 --> 00:01:05,506
你从“我想我爱上你了”转变成“我不会给她电话了”？
You went from "I think I'm in love with you" to "I'm not going to call her?"

31
00:01:05,507 --> 00:01:06,829
我没有爱上她好吗？
I wasn't in love with her, OK?

32
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:10,015
我只是爱上了“结婚”这个抽象概念
I was briefly in love with the abstract concept of getting married.

33
00:01:10,016 --> 00:01:11,886
这跟Robin没关系
That's absolutely nothing to do with Robin.

34
00:01:12,908 --> 00:01:13,769
-Robin？-嘿
-Robin?-Hey!

35
00:01:14,078 --> 00:01:15,295
瞧瞧我碰见谁了
Look who I ran into!

36
00:01:15,296 --> 00:01:16,759
你们俩什么时候认识的？
Since when do you guys know each other?

37
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,962
大概在这里的时候吧
Since about here.

38
00:01:19,731 --> 00:01:21,800
Lily认出我是新闻主播了，所以……
Lily recognized me from the news in that ...

39
00:01:19,985 --> 00:01:22,281

40
00:01:22,169 --> 00:01:23,134
悠着点，水手
Hello, sailor!

41
00:01:23,135 --> 00:01:24,466
他们刚刚订婚
They've just engaged.

42
00:01:26,345 --> 00:01:29,650
我该回台里去了，回头见
I should get back to the station. See you guys!

43
00:01:26,632 --> 00:01:28,020

44
00:01:31,423 --> 00:01:33,128
-很高兴见到你，Ted-是啊，我也是
-Nice to meet you, Ted.-Yeah, you, too.

45
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:36,693
-糟糕！-怎么了？
-Damn it!-What?

46
00:01:36,694 --> 00:01:37,706
我真的爱上她了
I'm in love with her.

47
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,011
不行！
No!

48
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:43,357
作为你的顾问，我可不想你一错再错,你这次搞砸了，故事结束，继续前进吧
As your sponsor, I will not let you relapse. You blew it. It's over. Move on!

49
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:41,825

50
00:01:42,246 --> 00:01:43,186

51
00:01:43,773 --> 00:01:47,590
我不知道，我就是有这样的感觉,她就是未来的Ted Mosbie夫人
I don't know. I just have this feeling: she's the future Mrs. Ted Mosbie.

52
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,281
Lily，你刚才尖叫了
Lily, you squeaked?

53
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:52,267
她跟你谈起我了，是不是？
She said something about me, didn't she?

54
00:01:52,268 --> 00:01:53,761
说出来吧，告诉我！
Come on! Spill it.

55
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:54,791
好吧
Fine.

56
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:57,064
嗯，你觉得Ted怎么样？
So, what do you think of Ted?

57
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:58,566

58
00:01:58,822 --> 00:02:00,375
他是个“例外”
Ted's something else.

59
00:02:01,593 --> 00:02:03,109
我觉得这是褒义的
I'm going to spin that is good.

60
00:02:03,183 --> 00:02:05,760
别的男性都常例，而我是“例外”
Lots of guys are something. I'm something else.

61
00:02:05,761 --> 00:02:07,143
有些过于主动了
Comes a little strong.

62
00:02:07,363 --> 00:02:09,772
但……这也算我的魅力吧
But that's part of my charm.

63
00:02:09,773 --> 00:02:11,482
但……这也算他的魅力吧
But that's part of his charm.

64
00:02:11,483 --> 00:02:14,199
哦，那是当然，我是说,他很体贴，很有魅力，只是……
Oh, totally. I mean, he's sweet, he's charming, he's just

65
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,771
他想要的东西比我想要的更郑重一些
looking for something a little bit more serious than I am.

66
00:02:16,772 --> 00:02:19,452
我说，我现在需要的，是随性一点的关系
I mean, the most I can handle now is something casual.

67
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,837
这些话你不会外传的吧？
This stays between us, right?

68
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:25,620
开什么玩笑，这两片唇闭得紧紧的
Are you kidding? This flapper afford knocks.

69
00:02:26,262 --> 00:02:26,988
Oops……

70
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:31,375
她想要随性一点，好的,我可以很随性
She wants casual. OK, I'll be casual.

71
00:02:29,552 --> 00:02:31,501
This flapper afford knocks.

72
00:02:31,704 --> 00:02:34,327
我现在就是一颗“随性”号原子弹
I'm going to be a mushroom cloud of casual.

73
00:02:34,327 --> 00:02:35,127
你知道为什么吗？
You know why?

74
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:39,367
因为这是个游戏,我是很想直达最后幸福圆满的结局
Because it's a game. I want to escape to the end and do the whole happily-ever-after thing.

75
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:41,540
但是你必须先玩游戏过关，才能有大结局
But you don't get there unless you play the game.

76
00:02:42,116 --> 00:02:43,149
那么你要约她出来了？
So you're going to ask her out?

77
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,370
是的……不！
Yeah! No!

78
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:48,043
我不能约她出来，因为如果我约她出来,我就是在约她出来了
I can't ask her out. If I ask her out, I'm asking her out.

79
00:02:46,121 --> 00:02:48,386

80
00:02:48,573 --> 00:02:51,869
所以我怎么能约她出来，而又没有约她出来呢？
So how do I ask her out without asking her out?

81
00:02:50,064 --> 00:02:51,336

82
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:55,166

83
00:02:55,527 --> 00:02:57,019
你们几个家伙是不是抽大烟了？
Did you guys get high?

84
00:02:57,963 --> 00:02:59,891
我有主意了，我们不约会
I got it. I don't ask her out.

85
00:03:00,268 --> 00:03:03,239
我要请她来参加我们下周五的派对
I invite her to our party next Friday.

86
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,542
-我们下周五要开派对？-刚刚决定的
-We're having a party next Friday?-We are now.

87
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:06,848
“随性”
Casual.

88
00:03:07,118 --> 00:03:11,881
是啊，没有比“找来一百个人开派对，就是为了泡一个mm”更随性的了，哦，Lily……
Yeah, because nothing is just casual like inviting a hundred people over just to meet on one girl. Oh, and Lily.

89
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:13,480
那是我的腿
That's my leg.

90
00:03:14,811 --> 00:03:17,012
你过了5分钟才告诉我？
You waited 5 minutes to tell me that?

91
00:03:15,056 --> 00:03:20,022

92
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:19,747
好的，给她打电话吧
Alright, so call her up.

93
00:03:19,748 --> 00:03:23,092
不，打电话一点也不“随性”,我得和她在什么地方偶遇
No, calling's not casual. I should get bumped into somewhere.

94
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,209
真希望我有她行程表,我就能安排一次偶然的邂逅了
If only I knew her schedule I could arrange a chance encounter.

95
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:29,680
说得好，你就成了最最随性的跟踪者了
That's great, Ted. You'll be the most casual stalker ever.

96
00:03:28,225 --> 00:03:31,712

97
00:03:32,643 --> 00:03:35,068
自从戴上Marshal送的戒指之后……
Now ever since Marshal put that ring on her finger

98
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:38,960
Lily变得有点……嗯……贪心
Lily had been, well, extra affectionate

99
00:03:39,323 --> 00:03:41,032
宝贝，现在不行……
Baby, no!

100
00:03:41,424 --> 00:03:45,376
我周日要交一篇关于宪法的25页的论文,我才刚刚开始写
I have a 25-page paper on constitution. I'll due Monday. I barely started.

101
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,330
我只不过是坐在这儿……
I am just sitting here.

102
00:03:47,897 --> 00:03:49,340
戴着手上的戒指
wearing my ring

103
00:03:50,038 --> 00:03:51,646
我漂亮的戒指啊
my beautiful ring

104
00:03:53,244 --> 00:03:55,762
让我身上别的东西有点不对劲了
kinda makes wearing other stuff seem wrong.

105
00:03:55,244 --> 00:03:56,985

106
00:03:56,848 --> 00:04:00,288
我的衬衫……我不想再穿了
My shirt. Kinda don't want to wear my shirt anymore.

107
00:03:59,809 --> 00:04:01,486

108
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,729
或者……我的内衣
or my underwear.

109
00:04:04,682 --> 00:04:06,564
哦，对了，我没穿内衣
That's right. I'm not wearing any.

110
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:10,497

111
00:04:09,513 --> 00:04:12,672
-没穿内衣？-一点也没穿
-No underwear.-Not even slightly.

112
00:04:12,673 --> 00:04:13,389
两位……
Guys!

113
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:16,324
有个限度
Boundaries.

114
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:18,875
她在那！

115
00:04:18,876 --> 00:04:19,979
谢谢你，Bill
Thanks, Bill.

116
00:04:20,092 --> 00:04:24,126
我现在在Colombus大街75号abcrazzle dazzle超市为您报道
I'm reporting from the Razzle Dazzle Supermarket on 75th in Colombus.

117
00:04:24,412 --> 00:04:25,913
Colombus大街75号
75th in Colombus.

118
00:04:27,492 --> 00:04:28,158
好戏开始！
Game on!

119
00:04:28,663 --> 00:04:33,763
4岁的Neroy Alenberg爬进了一台抓公仔机并受困其中……
There she is.
A 4-year-old Nebroy Alenberg has climbed inside a grab-a-prize machine and got him stuck

120
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:31,029

121
00:04:31,147 --> 00:04:35,353

122
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:37,216

123
00:04:37,468 --> 00:04:40,276
仅仅为了得到一个紫色的长颈鹿
and on the pursuit of a stuffed purple giraffe.

124
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,699
都市新闻一台为您报道,我是Robin Trabonski
Metro News 1. I'm Robin Trabowski.

125
00:04:47,506 --> 00:04:48,091
Ted？
Ted?

126
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:51,502
Robin，哇，这巧啊
Robin? Wow, what are the odds!

127
00:04:51,503 --> 00:04:52,478
你在这儿干什么？
What are you doing here?

128
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,060
哦，我是来买东西的……买调味酱
Oh, you know, just shopping for dip.

129
00:04:56,094 --> 00:04:57,075
我爱调味酱
I love dip.

130
00:04:57,355 --> 00:05:00,045
不，我不爱调味酱,我只是喜欢调味酱，朋友之间的那种
Not I love dip. I like dip, as a friend, you know.

131
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:00,341

132
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:03,799
对了，你是在这报道什么新闻吗？
Hey, you're reporting a news story or something?

133
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,445
是啊，一个小孩捆在抓公仔机里了,如果你愿意称之为新闻的话
Yeah, kid's stuck in a cream machine. How sweet of you to call it news.

134
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:08,651

135
00:05:07,652 --> 00:05:10,017
哦，小孩捆在抓公仔机里了
Wow, kid in a cream machine.

136
00:05:10,325 --> 00:05:13,263
你是真的很想要那个玩具咯,不想遵循常规
You just said to have that toy, didn't you? Couldn't play the game like everyone else.

137
00:05:13,264 --> 00:05:14,777
你浑身都是汗
You're all sweaty.

138
00:05:15,743 --> 00:05:16,512
孩子真可爱
Cool kid.

139
00:05:17,645 --> 00:05:20,390
话说回来，既然这么巧遇见你,我们下周五要举办一个派对
It was so funny I should run into you. We're having a party next Friday

140
00:05:20,391 --> 00:05:23,587
如果你有兴趣来的话，不过“不必太认真”
If you like swinging by. But you know, whatever.

141
00:05:24,285 --> 00:05:25,839
哦，我下周末要回家
Oh, I'm going back home next weekend.

142
00:05:26,301 --> 00:05:27,458
真可惜不是今晚
It's too bad it's not tonight.

143
00:05:27,887 --> 00:05:29,217
是的，就是今晚
It is. It's tonight.

144
00:05:29,218 --> 00:05:30,982
这周五，我说了下周五吗？
This Friday. Did I say next Friday?

145
00:05:30,983 --> 00:05:33,400
是的，我很抱歉,大概是整个星期都在说“下周五”
Yes, sorry. I've been, I guess, I've been saying 'next Friday' all week.

146
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:37,854
不过，派对就是今晚，不过“不必太认真”
But, yes, tonight. The party's tonight. But you know, whatever.

147
00:05:38,081 --> 00:05:39,702

148
00:05:40,183 --> 00:05:41,390

149
00:05:41,837 --> 00:05:43,224

150
00:05:43,521 --> 00:05:44,168
喂
Hello.

151
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:45,933
嘿，我打搅到你吗？
Hey, am I interrupting anything?

152
00:05:45,934 --> 00:05:49,180
没有，我还在写论文，啃书本
No, now I'm just writing my paper.

153
00:05:47,587 --> 00:05:52,230

154
00:05:49,688 --> 00:05:52,199
是啊，嗯，你和Lily也许该穿好衣服了
Yeah, well, you and Lily may want to put some clothes on.

155
00:05:52,627 --> 00:05:54,918
我们两个小时之内要开派对,好的，拜
We're throwing a party in 2 hours. OK, bye.

156
00:05:58,139 --> 00:05:58,814

157
00:05:58,815 --> 00:06:00,654

158
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,413
那么，兄弟，Robin出现你打算怎样
So, what are you going to do when Robin shows up?

159
00:06:03,414 --> 00:06:05,722
好的，我的计划好了
OK, I got it all planned out.

160
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:08,206
她走进门来
She steps through the door.

161
00:06:08,207 --> 00:06:11,351
Ted在哪儿？并不是焦急的等候在门口
And where is Ted? Not eagerly wait by the door.

162
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:17,470
我在房子的另一边，给一个惹火的姑娘展示我的建筑画图的工具
Now I'm across the room at my drafting table showing some foxy young thing all my cool architecture stuff.

163
00:06:14,865 --> 00:06:17,110

164
00:06:17,885 --> 00:06:21,455
Robin走了过来，我很随性的跟她说……
So Robin throws her over and I casually give her one of these.

165
00:06:21,455 --> 00:06:23,236
嘿，你好啊
Hey, what's up?

166
00:06:22,109 --> 00:06:25,387

167
00:06:23,814 --> 00:06:27,198
然后她说，嘿，地方不错啊
She says, 'hey,nice place. etc. etc.'

168
00:06:27,592 --> 00:06:28,440
然后我再说
Then I say,

169
00:06:29,024 --> 00:06:30,610
那就别客气，把这里当你自己家吧
'well, make yourself at home.'

170
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,179
然后我就很随性的重新和别人聊天去了
And I casually return to my conversation.

171
00:06:33,437 --> 00:06:35,025
接着，一个小时后
Then, an hour later,

172
00:06:36,494 --> 00:06:38,776
哦，你还在啊
'oh, you're still here?'

173
00:06:38,777 --> 00:06:40,775
我很不经意的这么说
I say, like I don't really care.

174
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:43,813
不过这也是个不错的开头,然后，我非常随性的……
But it's a nice surprise and then very casually,

175
00:06:42,322 --> 00:06:43,206

176
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,448
向上房顶看看吗？
'wanna see the roof?'

177
00:06:45,469 --> 00:06:48,147


178
00:06:48,094 --> 00:06:51,684
-房顶……-带上房顶后，房顶会帮我料理好一切的
-The roof!-You got to run up to the roof. And the roof takes care of the rest.

179
00:06:51,685 --> 00:06:53,168
这房顶有什么特别的
What's so special about the roof?

180
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:56,483
哦，月亮，星光，朦胧的远景
Oh, the moon, stars, the shimmering skylight.

181
00:06:56,935 --> 00:06:59,158
在那个房顶上，你不可能不陷入爱河
You cannot fall in love on that roof.

182
00:07:00,383 --> 00:07:01,971
我们还在上面“玩”过几次
We do it up there sometimes.

183
00:07:02,777 --> 00:07:04,458
计划很周详，我的小朋友
Solid plan, my little friend.

184
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:05,419
我们身高差不多……
We were the same plate.

185
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:08,379
不过让我提个小小的改动
But may I suggest one little modification?

186
00:07:07,444 --> 00:07:08,990

187
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:12,498
和你聊天的那个惹火的MM把她带上房顶去，两个人干柴烈火
That foxy young thing that you were chatting up? Take her up to the roof and have sex with her,

188
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:14,523
-疯狂的猴猴姿势……-这不是原计划！
-crazy monkey style..-That's not the plan!

189
00:07:14,836 --> 00:07:16,358
这才应该是原计划,你瞧瞧她
That should be the plan. I mean, look at her!

190
00:07:16,359 --> 00:07:18,588
Ted，你瞧瞧她,惹火的都冒烟了
Ted, look at her! She's smoking!

191
00:07:18,907 --> 00:07:20,674
谢谢
Thank you!

192
00:07:20,675 --> 00:07:22,232
但她不是Robin
But she's not Robin.

193
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,708
这就是问题所在,Ted，你听我说
Exactly. Ted, let's rap.

194
00:07:25,207 --> 00:07:29,482
统计学上来讲，在纽约的每一个派对上都会有这样一个小妞，她根本不知道这是谁开的派对
Statistic. At every New York party, there's always a girl who has no idea who's party she's at.

195
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:32,309
她根本不认识你周围的任何人,你也不会再见到她第二次了
She knows no one you know and you will never see her again.

196
00:07:32,788 --> 00:07:36,710
你明白……我的意思吗,这个提议怎么样？
Do you see where I'm going? How is this?

197
00:07:33,171 --> 00:07:35,496

198
00:07:36,892 --> 00:07:38,562
Barney，我不这么觉得……
Barney, I don't think so.

199
00:07:38,563 --> 00:07:39,375
潜望中……
Scoping.

200
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,157
继续潜望……
Scoping.

201
00:07:41,896 --> 00:07:43,137
天啊，你真口耐
Man, you are a dork.

202
00:07:44,303 --> 00:07:45,705
目标锁定
Target acquired.

203
00:07:45,706 --> 00:07:47,989
现在我们来玩个小游戏,我愿意称之为……
And now it's time we play a little game I'd like to call'have you met Ted.' 

204
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:50,388
-“你见过Ted吗？”-哦，别这样，又来……
-'have you met Ted.'-Oh, come on. Not this.

205
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:51,568
嗨，你见过Ted没有？
Hi, have you met Ted?

206
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:52,254
没有
No.

207
00:07:52,255 --> 00:07:53,402
-你好-你好
Hi.Hi.

208
00:07:53,402 --> 00:07:54,539
你认识Marshal和Lily吗？
You know Marshal and Lily?

209
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,223
不认识
No.

210
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,916
这个派对里面你都认识谁啊？
Do you know anyone at this party?

211
00:07:57,306 --> 00:07:58,569
我和Carlos一起来的
I work with Carlos.

212
00:07:59,056 --> 00:07:59,672
稍等……
Excuse me.

213
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,169
你们谁认识Carlos？
Anyone know a Carlos?

214
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,755
不认识
No.

215
00:08:02,756 --> 00:08:06,326
银质大盘送上的……大肥肉
On a silver platter bone appetite.

216
00:08:06,472 --> 00:08:07,511
我不这么想
I don't think so.

217
00:08:08,236 --> 00:08:09,617
你放弃，我上场
You are loss or gain.

218
00:08:09,911 --> 00:08:12,004
对不起，我能带你去看看房顶吗？
Excuse me, can I show you the roof?

219
00:08:12,005 --> 00:08:13,849
-上面的美景很迷人-好啊
-It's magical up there.
-Sure.

220
00:08:11,797 --> 00:08:12,982

221
00:08:13,883 --> 00:08:15,543
等等，嘿，房顶我预订了
Wait. Hey, I got that roof reserved.

222
00:08:13,696 --> 00:08:15,461

223
00:08:15,544 --> 00:08:16,748
Robin不会来了
Dude, Robin's not coming.

224
00:08:16,749 --> 00:08:18,899
嘿，她会出现的！
She'll show up.

225
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:19,895

226
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:21,549

227
00:08:22,146 --> 00:08:22,928
她会来的
Hey, she's going to show up.

228
00:08:23,473 --> 00:08:24,609
她没有来
She didn't show up.

229
00:08:26,036 --> 00:08:27,867
至少我们开了一个很棒的派对
At least it was a great party.

230
00:08:28,678 --> 00:08:30,491
我吃完了4大罐调味酱
I ate, like, 4 cans of dip.

231
00:08:29,011 --> 00:08:31,193

232
00:08:31,369 --> 00:08:33,214
你总是知道怎么安慰我，老朋友
You always know what to say, old friend.

233
00:08:33,152 --> 00:08:34,883

234
00:08:34,884 --> 00:08:36,140

235
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,382

236
00:08:37,872 --> 00:08:38,547
是Robin
It's Robin.

237
00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:40,792
-接啊-不不不，我不能马上接
-Answer it.
-No, not right away.

238
00:08:40,792 --> 00:08:41,829
我要显得随性一些
I got to seem casual.

239
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:44,626
喂
Hello.

240
00:08:44,627 --> 00:08:46,535
真的很抱歉，我错过了你的派对
I'm so sorry I missed your party.

241
00:08:47,004 --> 00:08:48,090
你是哪位？Meredith？
Who's this? Meredith?

242
00:08:48,749 --> 00:08:49,631
Robin
Robin.

243
00:08:49,632 --> 00:08:52,480
哦，Robin，嘿,是啊是啊
Oh, Robin! Hey, yeah.

244
00:08:51,385 --> 00:08:53,309

245
00:08:53,131 --> 00:08:54,583
看样子你没能来，是不？
I guess you never showed up, did you?

246
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,336
没有，我被工作缠住了,不过……
No, I got stuck at work but

247
00:08:56,337 --> 00:08:58,391
他们总算把那小孩从机器里弄出来了
they finally got that kid out of the cream machine.

248
00:08:58,392 --> 00:09:00,020
他能保留那个紫色的长颈鹿吗？
Did he get to keep the purple giraffe?

249
00:09:00,021 --> 00:09:02,279
是的，那孩子可以拿走全部的玩具
Yeah, they let him keep all the toys.

250
00:09:02,535 --> 00:09:05,493
他困在里面太久了,都热出疹子了
He was in there a long time and little kids have small bladders.

251
00:09:04,462 --> 00:09:05,208

252
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:07,199

253
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,312
真希望你的派对是今天就好了
I wish your party was tonight.

254
00:09:10,538 --> 00:09:11,703
没错，派对就是今晚
It is. The party's tonight.

255
00:09:10,428 --> 00:09:13,398

256
00:09:12,987 --> 00:09:16,182
是啊，这个派对要开两天,这才是我们的风格
Yeah, it's a two-day party. Because that's how we roll.

257
00:09:15,591 --> 00:09:17,418

258
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:21,060
所以，你想不想顺道来玩玩,随性就好
So, if you want to swing by? You know, it's casual.

259
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,235
今晚见
See ya.

260
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:23,615

261
00:09:23,882 --> 00:09:26,966

262
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:26,940
是Robin打来的
So that was Robin.

263
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:30,725
-你为什么这么做，我还有一篇论文要写呢-我知道，我很抱歉，这很糟糕
-What are you doing to me? I've got a paper to write.
-I know. I'm sorry it's terrible.

264
00:09:31,168 --> 00:09:32,529
-我会给你买更多的调味酱的-Ted!
-I'll buy more dip.
-Ted!

265
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,738
Ted，等等！！
Ted, wait!

266
00:09:34,711 --> 00:09:36,003
我要法国洋葱口味的！
Get French onion.

267
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,508
你看这个人，我还有论文要写呢
Can you believe this guy? I've got a paper to write.

268
00:09:44,615 --> 00:09:47,380
好吧好吧，但一定要迅速完事
OK, fine. But it's got to be like super quick

269
00:09:47,738 --> 00:09:48,866
而且事后也不能有拥抱
and no cuddling after.

270
00:09:48,867 --> 00:09:51,220
我是最幸运的女孩儿……
I'm the luckiest girl alive.

271
00:09:53,738 --> 00:09:55,157

272
00:09:55,158 --> 00:09:56,418

273
00:09:57,903 --> 00:09:59,981
你说的房顶真是太对了
You were so right about the roof.

274
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:04,340
那房顶，那房顶是超级催化剂
The roof, the roof is on fire, Ted.

275
00:10:03,313 --> 00:10:05,562

276
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:05,761
昨晚那小妞……
The girl from last night

277
00:10:05,762 --> 00:10:10,361
我把她带回家了，今天早上送她出来,带着绕了几圈，接着送她走了
I took her back to my place then this morning took her outside, spun her around a couple of times, and sent her walking.

278
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:10,642

279
00:10:10,362 --> 00:10:13,037
她绝对找不到回来的路了,而她就在那儿！
She will never find her way back and there she is!

280
00:10:12,193 --> 00:10:14,646

281
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,748
她怎么过来的，你邀请她来了？
How did she get here? Did you inviter her?

282
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:16,780
我不认识她
I've no idea who that is.

283
00:10:16,781 --> 00:10:18,357
她说她是和Carlos一起来的，Carlos是谁？
She said she worked with Carlos. Who's Carlos?

284
00:10:18,358 --> 00:10:19,508
我不知道谁是Carlos
I don't know any Carlos.

285
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:22,066
嗨，是你啊
Hi, you.

286
00:10:22,262 --> 00:10:23,124
你回来了
You're back.

287
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,056
当然了
I sure am.

288
00:10:26,677 --> 00:10:28,305
来吧，亲爱的，我想喝两杯
Come on, sweetie, I need to drink.

289
00:10:28,306 --> 00:10:29,665
亲爱的？真的？
Sweetie? Really?

290
00:10:32,094 --> 00:10:34,883

291
00:10:33,669 --> 00:10:36,534
哦，兔子们，别这样,房顶我预订了
Oh, rabbits, come on! I got that roof reserved.

292
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:37,710

293
00:10:37,711 --> 00:10:38,786

294
00:10:39,327 --> 00:10:42,501
我和“和Carlos一起来”的小妞的关系吹了
So it's over between me and worked-with-Carlos girl.

295
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:41,631

296
00:10:42,502 --> 00:10:43,711
哦，很快啊
Oh, that was fast.

297
00:10:43,712 --> 00:10:48,358
是啊，我一直在找一个甩掉刚认识的小妞的办法
Yeah, I was trying to think what's the quickest way to get rid of a girl you just met.

298
00:10:45,402 --> 00:10:46,373

299
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,347
-我想我爱上你了-什么？
-I think I'm in love with you.
-What?

300
00:10:51,347 --> 00:10:52,431
谢谢你，伙计
Thanks, bro.

301
00:10:52,432 --> 00:10:53,565
我很乐意帮忙
Glad I could help.

302
00:10:55,937 --> 00:10:56,666
怎么……
What the ...

303
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:58,119
不不不，不能这样！
What the ...

304
00:10:58,587 --> 00:10:59,633
对不起，Ted
Sorry, Ted.

305
00:11:01,282 --> 00:11:03,472
太好了，现在Robin来了我怎么办？
Wait, what I'm going to do when Robin shows up?

306
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,371
她会来的！
She'll show up.

307
00:11:06,028 --> 00:11:07,032
她没有来
She didn't show up.

308
00:11:08,165 --> 00:11:10,479
现在好了，我们开了两场派对
Alright, we threw two parties.

309
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,975
每个人都开心了
Everybody had fun.

310
00:11:12,468 --> 00:11:14,645
每个人都享受了，每个人都舒坦了
Everybody wanned. Everybody chant.

311
00:11:15,673 --> 00:11:17,280
现在小孩子该干正事了
And now the kid's got to get to work.

312
00:11:17,281 --> 00:11:19,872
而且这个小孩子不能被打搅,跟我一起说
And the kid is not to be disturbed. Repeat after me

313
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:22,114
我不会和Marshal嘿咻
I will not have sex with Marshal.

314
00:11:20,377 --> 00:11:21,891
315
00:11:22,423 --> 00:11:24,601
我不会和Marshal嘿咻
I will not have sex with Marshal.

316
00:11:25,189 --> 00:11:27,472

317
00:11:28,043 --> 00:11:28,729
Robin打来的
It's Robin.

318
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:31,842
喂
Hello.

319
00:11:31,843 --> 00:11:33,213
-嗨，Ted？-Amanda？
-Hi, Ted.
-Amanda?

320
00:11:33,214 --> 00:11:36,347
哦，Dannis，对不起,你听起来真像Amanda
Oh, Dannis. Sorry, you totally sounded like Armanda.

321
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,339

322
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:37,418
我是Robin
It's Robin.

323
00:11:37,419 --> 00:11:38,555
哦，Robin
Oh, Robin.

324
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:39,703
你好
Hi.

325
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,569
我真的很想来
I totally wanted to come.

326
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,888
我又被工作缠住了,感觉就像住在办公室一样
I got stuck at work again. I feel like I live there.

327
00:11:44,451 --> 00:11:45,935
很抱歉，再次缺席你的派对
Sorry to miss your party again.

328
00:11:46,488 --> 00:11:48,800
（西班牙语？）

329
00:11:49,222 --> 00:11:50,500
我怎么了？
Who am I?

330
00:11:51,651 --> 00:11:54,414
我知道你的两天派对不可能再延长到三天了
I guess there is no chance you two-dayer turned into a three-dayer.

331
00:11:55,735 --> 00:11:57,607
不，又延长了,派对今晚照旧
You didn't need. The party continues tonight.

332
00:11:57,898 --> 00:11:58,667
是啊……
yeah.

333
00:11:59,233 --> 00:12:02,427
昨晚上，大家都在喊“继续吧，派对专家”
Last night, people were like,"Keep it going, bro! Party trifecta! "

334
00:12:02,948 --> 00:12:05,325
哇哦，很好啊，我会来的
OK, I'll be there.

335
00:12:02,869 --> 00:12:04,054

336
00:12:05,326 --> 00:12:07,138
很好，今晚见
Great. See you tonight.

337
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,196

338
00:12:07,197 --> 00:12:09,615

339
00:12:10,101 --> 00:12:11,276
Robin打来的
So that was Robin.

340
00:12:13,605 --> 00:12:17,569
于是，我为Robin开了第三个派对……在周日的晚上
So I threw a third party for Robin on a Sunday night.

341
00:12:15,176 --> 00:12:16,509

342
00:12:18,641 --> 00:12:20,064
真够无趣的
Oh, this is lame.

343
00:12:20,504 --> 00:12:22,758
无趣，还是随性？
Lame or casual?

344
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,570
-无趣-或是随性
-Lame.
-Or casual.

345
00:12:26,531 --> 00:12:33,981
对不起，宝贝，我要工作,我需要血液集中在这儿
-Sorry, baby, I got to work. I need all my blood up here.

346
00:12:29,489 --> 00:12:31,967

347
00:12:31,968 --> 00:12:33,857

348
00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:40,335
有没有人见到一本《1865-1923雕塑赔偿合同导论》？
Has anybody seen 'an Introduction to Contract toward Restitution Statutes from 1865 to 1923?'

349
00:12:36,947 --> 00:12:38,172

350
00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:44,734

351
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:43,668
有没有人看见一本又大又厚的书？
Anybody seen a big ass book?

352
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:46,979
你好，Barney
Hello, Barney.

353
00:12:48,464 --> 00:12:50,001
哦，当然了
Oh, of course.

354
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,571
你看起来不错
You look well

355
00:12:53,276 --> 00:12:55,076
真奇怪，他们把我们俩都邀请来了
Is it weird they invited both of us?

356
00:12:56,115 --> 00:12:57,191
谁？
Who?

357
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:01,127
谁会邀请你？没有人认识你
Who invited you? No one even knows who you are!

358
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,997
我明白你很受伤，但是……
I understand you are hurt. But

359
00:13:04,447 --> 00:13:05,913
你不用说的这么绝吧
you don't have to be cruel.

360
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,391
Carlos说得对
Carlos was right about you.

361
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,538
谁是Carlos？
Who is Carlos?

362
00:13:11,908 --> 00:13:13,502
好吧，我的

363
00:13:13,503 --> 00:13:14,462
好吧，到底上哪儿找我的……
OK, where the hell is my...

364
00:13:17,996 --> 00:13:18,695
好吧
OK.

365
00:13:20,335 --> 00:13:25,615
《1865-1923雕塑赔偿合同导论》……
'an Introduction to Contract toward Restitution Statutes from 1865 to 1923'


366
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:23,843

367
00:13:25,616 --> 00:13:27,548
不是一个杯垫！
is not a coaster!

368
00:13:27,549 --> 00:13:30,993
Ted，我在拿我的法律生涯开玩笑就为了你能开，不是一个……
Ted, I'm jeopardizing my law careers so you can throw not one,

369
00:13:30,994 --> 00:13:34,235
不是两个，而是三个派对就为了某个姑娘
not two, but three parties for some girl

370
00:13:34,236 --> 00:13:36,455
你们不过刚刚认识，她甚至不一定来
that you just met who's probably never going to show up.

371
00:13:36,456 --> 00:13:38,128
我说，她在哪儿，Ted？
I mean where is she, Ted?

372
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:39,232
Robin在哪儿？
Where is Robin?

373
00:13:41,398 --> 00:13:43,599
嗨……嗨，Robin
Hi, Robin.

374
00:13:43,057 --> 00:13:44,057

375
00:13:47,742 --> 00:13:48,471

376
00:13:50,181 --> 00:13:55,686

377
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:54,910
这么说，你开了这么多派对就为了我？
So you threw all these parties for me?

378
00:13:55,772 --> 00:13:57,953
不，你这么想，当然不……
No, oh, you thought that. No!

379
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:00,733
好吧，我承认，你抓到我了
OK, yes, you got me.

380
00:14:00,734 --> 00:14:05,226
我开这些派对的原因之一就是想给你介绍……
One of the reasons I threw these parties was so that I could introduce you to

381
00:14:04,675 --> 00:14:06,989

382
00:14:06,188 --> 00:14:06,976
这个人
This guy.

383
00:14:07,836 --> 00:14:11,553
我想，既然我们之间没戏了,我们可以一笑忘之
I figured, you know, since it didn't work out between us, now we can just laugh about it.

384
00:14:13,571 --> 00:14:15,375
不管怎么说，Robin，这位是……
Anyway, Robin, this is

385
00:14:15,744 --> 00:14:16,542
Carlos
Carlos.

386
00:14:22,117 --> 00:14:23,508
她还在和Carlos聊着
She's still talking to Carlos.

387
00:14:24,358 --> 00:14:26,405
我还有希望，这还不是最后
I can still win this, it's not over.

388
00:14:26,406 --> 00:14:28,841
好吧，伙计，是时候讲清楚了
OK, buddy. It's time for the tough talk.

389
00:14:28,842 --> 00:14:31,804
Robin确实是好姑娘,但我们要面对现实
Robin seems great. But let's look at the fact.

390
00:14:31,805 --> 00:14:37,189
你想要结婚，而现在纽约城里有成千上万的姑娘在寻找你
You want to get married. And right now there are a million women looking for exactly you.

391
00:14:37,619 --> 00:14:39,163
只是Robin不是她们中的一员
But Robin ain't one of them.

392
00:14:39,164 --> 00:14:41,437
她不是其中一员,她就是我的另一半！
She's not just one of them. She's the one!

393
00:14:41,737 --> 00:14:44,491
是吗，你的另一半要上房顶了
Yeah. Well, 'the one' is heading up to 'the roof.'

394
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,571

395
00:14:47,218 --> 00:14:48,235
你想怎么办？
What are you going to do?

396
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:50,789
什么也不做
Nothing.

397
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,757
这个恋爱游戏，我必须玩下去
It's a game. I gotta just keep playing.

398
00:14:54,601 --> 00:14:56,052

399
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:59,073

400
00:14:59,074 --> 00:15:01,613

401
00:15:01,614 --> 00:15:04,702

402
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:10,317

403
00:15:10,765 --> 00:15:12,375

404
00:15:12,376 --> 00:15:14,746

405
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:17,931

406
00:15:20,774 --> 00:15:21,835

407
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,498

408
00:15:24,499 --> 00:15:27,593

409
00:15:31,962 --> 00:15:33,321
-嘿？abc-嘿！
-Hey.

410
00:15:33,322 --> 00:15:34,765
Carlos，我能不能和她单独谈谈
Carlos, can you give us some minute?

411
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:36,867
没问题
Hey, no sweet ombre.

412
00:15:37,581 --> 00:15:38,161
再见
See ya.

413
00:15:42,086 --> 00:15:42,600
Robin
Robin,

414
00:15:43,197 --> 00:15:45,713
听着，我开这个派对不是为了给你介绍Carlos
look, I didn't throw this party to set you up with Carlos.

415
00:15:45,714 --> 00:15:48,524
前一个也不是，前前一个也不是
Or the one before that. Or the one before that.

416
00:15:50,369 --> 00:15:52,161
我开这些派对，就想见见你
I threw these parties because I wanted to see you.

417
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:54,843
那么我现在来了
Well, here I am.

418
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,053
我们之间肯定有些什么,要不我就是疯了
There's something here unless I'm crazy.

419
00:16:00,044 --> 00:16:01,283
你没有疯
You're not crazy.

420
00:16:03,126 --> 00:16:06,403
我不知道，Ted，我是说我们才刚刚认识
I don't know, Ted. We barely know each other.

421
00:16:06,404 --> 00:16:09,495
而且你一直用那种眼神看着我就好像……
And you're looking at me with that look and it's like

422
00:16:09,882 --> 00:16:10,835
-像什么？-就好像……
-Like what?
-Like.

423
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:12,624
就好像……我们恋爱吧……
Like 'let's fall in love,

424
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:15,851
然后结婚，然后生小孩,再送他们去足球学校
and get married and have kids and drive them to soccer practice.'

425
00:16:15,852 --> 00:16:17,764
除非他们自己有兴趣,不然我不会强迫小孩去运动的
I'm not going to force sports on them unless they're interested.

426
00:16:17,671 --> 00:16:18,207

427
00:16:20,007 --> 00:16:23,139
这个眼神很好，可惜对象错了
It's a great look. But you're looking at the wrong girl.

428
00:16:21,454 --> 00:16:24,384

429
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,730
-不，没有abc-是的，你找错人了
-No, I'm not.
-Yes, you are.

430
00:16:25,143 --> 00:16:27,476
我现在不想结婚，也许永远都不会
I don't want to get married right now, maybe never.

431
00:16:28,426 --> 00:16:30,494
如果我们在一起了，我觉得……
If we got together I'd feel like

432
00:16:30,714 --> 00:16:33,133
就好像我不是嫁给你，就是伤你的心
I'd either have to marry you or break your heart.

433
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,363

434
00:16:34,738 --> 00:16:36,919
而这两个，我都没法做到
I just couldn't do either of those things,

435
00:16:37,895 --> 00:16:39,855
就像你也做不到“关掉”你对我的感觉一样
just like you can't turn off the way you feel.

436
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:43,026

437
00:16:43,027 --> 00:16:46,251

438
00:16:44,806 --> 00:16:46,072
关掉了，我们嘿咻吧
Click off, let's make out.

439
00:16:46,446 --> 00:16:47,298
什么？
What?

440
00:16:48,058 --> 00:16:49,849
怎么了，就是感情开关了
What? That was the off switch.

441
00:16:50,313 --> 00:16:51,398
我把它关了
And I turned it off.

442
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:55,849
我是说，没错，我是想谈恋爱,结婚，Blah，Blah，Blah
I mean, sure, yes. I want to fall in love, get married, blah, blah, blah.

443
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,351
但，另一方面……
But on the other hand,

444
00:16:57,806 --> 00:17:01,610
你，我，还有这房顶
you, me, the roof.

445
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,136

446
00:17:03,141 --> 00:17:04,176
没有这种开关
There is no off switch.

447
00:17:05,598 --> 00:17:06,517
有这种开关
There is an off switch.

448
00:17:07,812 --> 00:17:08,589
而且我把它关了
And it's off.

449
00:17:09,526 --> 00:17:10,396
不，没关
No, it's not

450
00:17:11,742 --> 00:17:12,560
关了
Yes, it is.

451
00:17:13,698 --> 00:17:15,565
-不，还没有-已经……

452
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:17,677
关了
No, it's not.

453
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,390

454
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,668

455
00:17:26,461 --> 00:17:28,328

456
00:17:28,812 --> 00:17:29,943

457
00:17:31,605 --> 00:17:32,648
不，还没关
No, it's not.

458
00:17:33,858 --> 00:17:35,626
你说得对，没有这种开关
You were right. There is no off switch.

459
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,050
天啊，我真希望有这种开关
God, I wish there was an off switch.

460
00:17:40,276 --> 00:17:41,137
我也这么想
Me, too.

461
00:17:42,188 --> 00:17:43,267

462
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,708

463
00:17:46,877 --> 00:17:48,535
那么……
So...

464
00:17:49,051 --> 00:17:50,504
接下来该怎么办
What to do now?

465
00:17:51,156 --> 00:17:52,009

466
00:17:53,564 --> 00:17:54,741
我们可以做好朋友
We could be friends.

467
00:17:57,887 --> 00:18:01,920
听着，我知道人们说这句话的时候听起来都很不真诚，但……
Look, I know it sounds insincere when people say that but.

468
00:18:02,895 --> 00:18:03,589
我们可以做好朋友
we could

469
00:18:04,692 --> 00:18:05,987
我不知道，Robin
I don't know, Robin.

470
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:07,877
我如今弄得自己像个大傻瓜
I made such a jackass of myself.

471
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:11,797
如果我们做朋友，每次我看到你我都会想到：“哦，对了，我是个大傻瓜”
If we started hanging out, every time I see you, it will be like, 'Oh, that's right, I'm a jackass.'

472
00:18:12,409 --> 00:18:13,604
你不是傻瓜
You're not a jackass.

473
00:18:14,283 --> 00:18:19,091
我很抱歉，我四月刚刚搬来,而且一直在工作
I'm sorry. I only moved here in April and I'm always working.

474
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:21,597
我只是到现在朋友圈子也不大
I just haven't met a lot of good people so far.

475
00:18:20,909 --> 00:18:21,806

476
00:18:23,807 --> 00:18:24,730
但我明白你
But I understand.

477
00:18:28,797 --> 00:18:32,023
也许过几个月，这件事都淡化了,我们可以……
Maybe in a few months after it's not so fresh we could all

478
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:31,574

479
00:18:32,508 --> 00:18:34,299
你知道，一起喝啤酒什么的
you know, get a beer.

480
00:18:35,257 --> 00:18:38,308
是啊，听起来不错
Yeah, that sounds good.

481
00:18:39,989 --> 00:18:41,084
以后再见，Ted
I'll see you, Ted.

482
00:18:44,494 --> 00:18:45,21

483
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:47,814
又或者，就现在
Or, you know, now.

484
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,689

485
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:53,776

486
00:18:51,785 --> 00:18:53,454
我们可以现在就去喝点啤酒
We could all get a beer now.

487
00:18:54,414 --> 00:18:55,660

488
00:18:56,968 --> 00:18:58,104
我同意
I'd like that.

489
00:19:00,934 --> 00:19:02,840
我的朋友都会爱上你的
My friends are going to love you.

490
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,538
喜欢你，你知道，朋友之间的那种
Like you, you know, as a friend.

491
00:19:06,252 --> 00:19:07,254
大傻瓜
Jackass!

492
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,191
难以相信
Unbelievable.

493
00:19:12,007 --> 00:19:14,729
简直就是灾难，他们是一起的
That's just a recipe for disarster. They worked together!

494
00:19:15,004 --> 00:19:15,711
你嫉妒了？
You're jealous?

495
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:19,122
哦，得了吧，有什么Carlos有的我没有？
Oh, please, what does Carlos have that I don't?

496
00:19:19,123 --> 00:19:19,991
他今晚有约会
A date tonight?

497
00:19:21,386 --> 00:19:23,217
说的漂亮，再来一遍
play it again.

498
00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:24,968
（录像倒带）他今晚有约会
A date tonight?

499
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:27,151
我爱死她了
I'm not sure I like her.

500
00:19:28,422 --> 00:19:29,737
你不是还有论文要写吗？
Hey, don't you have a paper to write?

501
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,462
-伙计，说话也不看对象-我知道
-Dude, you are talking to the kid.
-I know it.

502
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:35,864
我先把这杯喝个底朝天,在干了下一杯
I'm going to knock back this beer, I'm going to knock back one more beer.

503
00:19:35,865 --> 00:19:38,806
然后我再回家写一篇25页的论文
We could all get a beer now.
I'm going to go home. I'm going to write a 25-page paper.

504
00:19:38,807 --> 00:19:40,634
接着交上去，得一个A
I'm going to hand it in and I'm going to get an A.

505
00:19:40,924 --> 00:19:43,444
我的名字是Ruffles，而这就是事实
My name's Ruffith and that's the truffith.

506
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,034
他的论文评价是B减
He got a B minus.

507
00:19:46,035 --> 00:19:49,960
但仍然要说，一夜写出25页的论文,还得了个B减，这家伙很强
But still, 25 pages in one night, B minus? The kid is good.

508
00:19:50,913 --> 00:19:52,185
至少让我请你一杯啤酒
At least let me buy you a beer.

509
00:19:52,551 --> 00:19:53,901
我要请你们每一个人喝一杯
Come on. I'll buy everyone a beer.

510
00:19:54,061 --> 00:19:54,849
我帮你拿
I'll help carry.

511
00:19:56,558 --> 00:19:59,396

512
00:19:59,996 --> 00:20:01,481
-有件事你知道吗，Ted？-什么？
-You know something, Ted?
-What?

513
00:20:01,481 --> 00:20:02,581
你很有魅力的
You're a catch.

514
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,382
你一定会让某个女孩非常幸福
You're going to make some girl very happy.

515
00:20:05,383 --> 00:20:07,574
而我，要帮你找到这个女孩
And I am going to help you find her.

516
00:20:08,255 --> 00:20:09,983
那，就祝你好运吧
Well, good luck.

517
00:20:10,338 --> 00:20:13,847
我说，也许你的承诺太大了,这个城市里有上百万个女孩子
I mean, maybe New York is too big a town and there's millions of people in the city.

518
00:20:14,158 --> 00:20:17,619
在这么大一堆乱麻里一个男人怎么找到自己的终生伴侣，我是说……
How in all this mess is a guy supposed to find the love of his life? I mean,

519
00:20:15,409 --> 00:20:17,886

520
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:19,349
该从哪里开始？
Where even begin?

521
00:20:22,351 --> 00:20:23,981
嗨，你认识Ted吗？
Hi, have you met Ted?

522
00:20:24,502 --> 00:20:26,407

523
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:29,337

524
00:20:30,673 --> 00:20:32,038

525
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:36,131

526
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,451

527
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,241

528
00:20:40,408 --> 00:20:41,229

529
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,730

530
00:20:46,596 --> 00:20:48,144

531
00:20:48,145 --> 00:20:49,291

532
00:20:49,591 --> 00:20:52,212

533
00:20:52,213 --> 00:20:54,498

534
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,010
Well, good luck.

535
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:01,039

536
00:21:01,363 --> 00:21:04,972

537
00:21:05,857 --> 00:21:06,776

538
00:21:09,906 --> 00:21:11,605
