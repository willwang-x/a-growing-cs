How I met your mother
Season 1 Episode 14

4
00:00:12,736 --> 00:00:14,193
当你遇到某个特殊的人
when you meet someone special,

5
00:00:14,337 --> 00:00:16,227
生活中会突然充满了第一次
suddenly life is full of firsts.

6
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:17,742
第一次接吻
The first kiss.

7
00:00:17,905 --> 00:00:19,593
第一次共渡的夜晚
The first night together.

8
00:00:19,756 --> 00:00:21,578
第一次共渡的周末
The first weekend together.

9
00:00:21,741 --> 00:00:26,297
而我,这些第一次都在认识Victoria后48小时内发生了
For me,all those firsts happened  within 48 hours of meeting Victoria.

10
00:00:26,479 --> 00:00:29,529
他们应该快出来了, 都周一了
They have to come out soon,it's Monday.

11
00:00:29,768 --> 00:00:31,840
你觉得他们是一直在那没出来吗?
Do you think they've been in there the whole time?

12
00:00:31,993 --> 00:00:35,523
我不知道该骄傲还是该担心了
I don't know whether to be proud or concerned.

13
00:00:35,705 --> 00:00:37,920
也许他们根本不在里面
Maybe they're not even in there.

14
00:00:40,126 --> 00:00:40,864
早上好
Good morning.

15
00:00:41,027 --> 00:00:42,341
嘿,伙计们
Hey,guys.

16
00:00:42,456 --> 00:00:43,540
我假装没看见好了
I'm just going to ignore that.

17
00:00:43,703 --> 00:00:45,266
谢谢!
Thank you!

18
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,340
我希望你可以留下
I wish you could stay.

19
00:00:46,494 --> 00:00:49,448
我知道, 我也想,但我得去工作, 你也有个会议
I know,me,too. But I have to go to work,and you have that meeting.

20
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,263
结束后打给你?
Call you afterwards?

21
00:00:50,397 --> 00:00:53,600
我上班时给你发"信息"
I'll inappropriately text you during.

22
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:55,288
- 拜
- 拜
- Bye.
- Bye.

23
00:00:55,442 --> 00:00:57,293
-拜
-噢,Victoria, 你在这啊...
- Bye.
- Oh,Victoria,you're here...

24
00:00:57,475 --> 00:01:00,237
- toot-a-loo!
- 拜
- toot-a-loo!
- Bye.

25
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:02,222
连续两天?!
Two days straight?!

26
00:01:02,385 --> 00:01:05,157
哇,你房间肯定闻起来象猴子窝了现在!
Wow,your room must smell like a monkey cage!

27
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:09,338
快给出数字, Lily猜是8次,但我知道我的伙计肯定是这个两倍
Come on,give us a number. Lily guessed eight,but I know my boy got to double digits.

28
00:01:09,482 --> 00:01:10,959
- 零
- 什么? 什么?
- Zero.
- What? What?

29
00:01:11,132 --> 00:01:12,503
伙计们, 我们才刚认识
Guys,we just met.

30
00:01:12,685 --> 00:01:15,246
而且我们都在感情上犯过急进的错误
And we both screwed up relationships in the past by jumping in too quick,

31
00:01:15,419 --> 00:01:17,692
所以我们谈了下, 决定这次慢慢来
so we talked about it,and we decided to take this one slow.

32
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:20,137
- 她的主意
- 完全是她的意思!
- Her idea.
- Totally her idea!

33
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:22,084
我也不知道, 我很喜欢这女孩
But,I don't know,I'm really into this girl,

34
00:01:22,257 --> 00:01:23,676
如果必须以放慢速度为代价
and if going slow is what it takes to make this happen,

35
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:26,102
那么就那样吧
I say bring it on.

36
00:01:26,812 --> 00:01:27,724
三周后
three weeks later

37
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,101
我感觉不怎么好
I don't feel so good.

38
00:01:30,265 --> 00:01:33,142
就象我的睾丸混合了摇滚和苏打
It's like my testicles mixed pop rocks and soda.

39
00:01:33,305 --> 00:01:35,395
我不敢相信她让你等了整整一个月
I can't believe she's making you wait a whole month.

40
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:36,728
我可忍不了这么久
I would never put up with that.

41
00:01:36,891 --> 00:01:38,733
你一辈子就和一个女人干过那事
You've only had sex with one girl in your whole life.

42
00:01:38,896 --> 00:01:39,999
伤心!
Burn!

43
00:01:40,162 --> 00:01:45,417
Ted, 唯一可以等足一个月的理由是:
她只差一个月满18岁
Ted,the only reason to wait a month for sex is if the girl is 17 years,11 months old.

44
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,566
好消息:我明天晚上不用去报道猫猫秀了
Good news: I don't have to cover the cat show tomorrow night.

45
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:48,601
谁想出去晃晃?
Who's up for hanging out?

46
00:01:48,755 --> 00:01:50,769
我不行,我要和Victoria出去吃饭
Oh,I can't,I'm taking Victoria out for dinner.

47
00:01:50,932 --> 00:01:53,809
不行, 明天是我们在一起9周年纪念日
No,no,we can't,it's our nine-year anniversary.

48
00:01:53,934 --> 00:01:55,641
哇, 9年?
Wow,nine years?

49
00:01:55,804 --> 00:01:58,077
你们的关系升入4年级了
Your relationship's a fourth grader.

50
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,014
- 恭喜
- 谢谢
- Congrats.
- Thanks.

51
00:02:00,177 --> 00:02:02,862
我们要去Berkshires,现在正是盛产枫糖的时候
We're going to the Berkshires for the maple syrup harvest.

52
00:02:03,035 --> 00:02:06,660
纽约杂志"浪漫又省钱的渡假"前五名
It's one of New York Magazine's "top five romantic getaways on a budget."

53
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:09,729
谁说性事只是兽欲?
Who says sexual can't be sensible?

54
00:02:09,902 --> 00:02:12,491
似乎就只剩我们两了
Well,looks like it's going to be just you and me.

55
00:02:12,616 --> 00:02:14,121
真的吗?
Really?

56
00:02:14,284 --> 00:02:18,226
事实上, 我在和我的马提尼讲话
Actually,I was talking to my martini.

57
00:02:19,732 --> 00:02:20,557
准备出发了?
ready to go?

58
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,659
那是当然
Hell,yeah.

59
00:02:21,832 --> 00:02:24,489
周末躺在一张舒适的床上吃早餐
Nothing better than a weekend at a good bed and breakfast.

60
00:02:24,671 --> 00:02:28,517
是啊, 早上7点起床吃早餐, 准时
Yeah. Waking up for breakfast at 7:00 A.M. Sharp.

61
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,295
恭维着那里的味道和他们的针织大雁
Complimenting the odors and their collection of needle-point geese.

62
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:37,647
与试图挽回婚姻的中年夫妇尴尬的谈话
Awkward conversations with middle-aged couples trying to stave off divorce.

63
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,272
我们最好出发了, 大概要4个小时车程
Yeah,well,we'd better get going,it's like a four-hour drive.

64
00:02:41,435 --> 00:02:44,417
而且今晚还可能下雨
And it's supposed to rain tonight.

65
00:02:46,077 --> 00:02:48,244
-或者我们呆在家算了
-看看电视
- Or we could just stay home.
- Maybe watch some TV.

66
00:02:48,436 --> 00:02:51,534
- 订点中国餐
- 噢,四川菜!
- Order in some Chinese.
- Oh,sichuan garden!

67
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:52,982
- 我们说定了吗?
- 天,是的
- Are we really bailing?
- Hell,yeah.

68
00:02:53,126 --> 00:02:56,147
太好了, 因为这袋东西是空的
Good,cause this thing's empty.

69
00:03:00,961 --> 00:03:04,807
赌100块,你转过身来会令我"哇"
Hundred dollars says when you turn around,I say "wow."

70
00:03:05,363 --> 00:03:08,135
Barney,这是第3次你不小心向我搭讪了
Barney,this is the third time you've hit on me by accident.

71
00:03:08,298 --> 00:03:10,523
背后进攻当然会有这种风险
It's one of the many risks of the blind approach.

72
00:03:10,686 --> 00:03:13,994
平常都是两人配合的,Ted在对面告诉我目标辣不辣
It's usually a two-man operation where Ted signals that the target is hot.

73
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:17,437
但Ted正在搞蕾丝
But Ted's too busy being in a lesbian relationship.

74
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,995
为什么不在镜子里看女孩的影像?
Why don't you just check out the girl's reflection in the bar mirror?

75
00:03:21,177 --> 00:03:24,093
你不能只...哇哦!
You can't just... wow!

76
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:26,778
嘿? 怎么这么久?
Hey? What's taking so long?

77
00:03:26,913 --> 00:03:27,469
我得走了
I gotta go.

78
00:03:27,603 --> 00:03:30,125
别这么快,Scherbotsky
Not so fast,Scherbotsky.

79
00:03:30,288 --> 00:03:31,804
我喜欢你的主意
I like the way you think.

80
00:03:31,967 --> 00:03:33,281
利用镜子
That mirror thing.

81
00:03:33,434 --> 00:03:35,937
简单, 优雅
Simple. Elegant.

82
00:03:36,081 --> 00:03:38,085
好吧, 过期作废的提议
Okay,limited-time offer:

83
00:03:38,248 --> 00:03:40,330
我需要一个兄弟,和我一起干兄弟间的事情
I need a "bro" for my bro-ings on about town.

84
00:03:40,493 --> 00:03:43,427
你愿意当我的兄弟?
How would you like to be said bro?

85
00:03:43,581 --> 00:03:47,273
虽然是很好的提议,不过我正在陪一个刚被人甩的朋友
Well,as tempting as that sounds,I'm hanging out with my friend who just got dumped.

86
00:03:47,455 --> 00:03:49,508
她真的需要些支持...
She really needs some support...

87
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:53,401
或者陌生人的舌头伸进她喉咙
or a stranger's tongue down her throat.

88
00:03:53,555 --> 00:03:55,521
那似乎很健康
That seems healthy.

89
00:03:55,665 --> 00:03:56,547
好吧
All right.

90
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,359
我加入了
Guess I'm in.

91
00:04:00,498 --> 00:04:02,771
那么...再过一周
So... one more week

92
00:04:02,963 --> 00:04:04,478
就满一个月了
and it'll be a month.

93
00:04:04,641 --> 00:04:06,320
真的? 你确定?
Really? Are you sure?

94
00:04:06,502 --> 00:04:08,525
哇, 不知不觉的
Wow,that snuck up on me.

95
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:09,897
噢, 拜托
Oh,come on.

96
00:04:09,945 --> 00:04:12,477
18岁总是姗姗来迟
The 18th can't get here fast enough.

97
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,241
等等, 18?
Wait,the 18th?

98
00:04:14,414 --> 00:04:16,140
噢,糟糕! 我竟然会忘记!
Oh,crap! I can't believe I forgot this!

99
00:04:16,313 --> 00:04:18,471
我18号那天要出城!
I'm going to be out of town on the 18th!

100
00:04:18,605 --> 00:04:20,964
噢...呃
Oh. Well,um,

101
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,160
我们可以...等到你回来
we can just... wait until you get back.

102
00:04:23,342 --> 00:04:26,095
我们既然决定了慢慢来
I mean,the whole point was not to rush into this.

103
00:04:26,248 --> 00:04:27,169
是啊
Yeah.

104
00:04:27,322 --> 00:04:28,282
或者我们今晚就做
Or we could do it tonight.

105
00:04:28,445 --> 00:04:31,024
Amsterdam和75街路口
75th and Amsterdam.

106
00:04:37,257 --> 00:04:39,569
真高兴我们决定呆在家
I'm so glad we decided to just stay home.

107
00:04:39,722 --> 00:04:41,266
我理解, 你能想象如果我们去了?
Oh,I know. Can you imagine if we'd gone?

108
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,702
我们可能现在才刚到, 又累又烦躁
We'd be just getting there now,all tired and cranky.

109
00:04:43,865 --> 00:04:46,416
做爱将变成一种义务
And yet we'd feel obligated to have sex.

110
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:50,415
为了89美元一晚的房费我们还是要做的
Yeah,for 89 bucks a night,we're doing it.

111
00:04:52,429 --> 00:04:54,980
我提议我们干一杯
I would like to propose a toast.

112
00:04:55,143 --> 00:04:58,040
为了我们最棒的周年纪念日
To the most awesomely mellow anniversary ever.

113
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:05,923
嗯...
Ah...

114
00:05:07,227 --> 00:05:08,982
我真高兴你下周末得回父母家
I'm so glad you have to go to your parents' next weekend.

115
00:05:09,136 --> 00:05:11,361
我真高兴你的室友们不在
I'm so glad your roommates are out of town.

116
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:13,998
我的天, 他们在干什么?
Oh,my god,what are they doing home?

117
00:05:14,152 --> 00:05:16,175
他们以为我们走了
They think we went away.

118
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:21,229
Ted终于要得手了!
Oh,it is on for my boy,Ted.

119
00:05:21,383 --> 00:05:23,761
但我们没走, 我们在浴室里
But we didn't go away,we're in the bathroom.

120
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:24,979
他们不知道这个啊
They don't know that.

121
00:05:25,161 --> 00:05:29,621
我们要做的就是躲在这里等Ted把她移进卧室
All we have to do is hide out in here until Ted moves his mojo into the bedroom.

122
00:05:29,784 --> 00:05:31,875
但我不想躲在这
But I don't want to hide out in here.

123
00:05:32,047 --> 00:05:35,231
亲爱的, Ted等这一刻都快等疯了
Honey,Ted has been going out of his mind waiting for this.

124
00:05:35,404 --> 00:05:37,543
如果我们现在出去破坏气氛,就不会继续发生了
If we go out there and spoil the mood,it's not going to happen.

125
00:05:37,706 --> 00:05:40,276
我们中的一个就得去和Ted做爱
Then one of us is going to have to have sex with Ted,and...

126
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,462
...反正我是不干
...not gonna be me.

127
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:45,167
好, 好吧
Okay,fine.

128
00:05:45,992 --> 00:05:48,102
顺便剔剔牙好了
I guess I'll actually floss.

129
00:05:54,422 --> 00:05:55,822
你穿西装了!
You suited up!

130
00:05:55,995 --> 00:05:57,682
要么不做
Well,I figured if I'm going to do this,

131
00:05:57,855 --> 00:05:59,581
要做就做好
I'm going to do this right.

132
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:01,346
Emilio? 这位女士想要...
Emilio? The woman will have...

133
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:06,602
一杯尊尼获加, 蓝牌,不加水，一支蒙特克里斯托2号.谢谢.
I'll have a Johnnie Walker Blue,neat,and a Montecristo No. 2. Thanks.

134
00:06:06,736 --> 00:06:10,495
啊, 2号...又名"鱼雷"
Ah,The No. 2,A.K.A. "The Torpedo."

135
00:06:10,677 --> 00:06:14,427
卷烟工人爱把它做"Piramide."
Or,as the rollers call it,"Piramide."

136
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:18,542
我爸爸是个雪茄爱好者
这是引起他注意的唯一方法
My father was a cigar fanatic,it was the only way to get his attention.

137
00:06:18,724 --> 00:06:20,172
恋父情结
Father issues.

138
00:06:20,335 --> 00:06:21,524
够辣
Hot.

139
00:06:21,687 --> 00:06:25,092
我知道--我离荡妇就差那么点了
I know-- I was this close to being a huge slut.

140
00:06:25,255 --> 00:06:27,624
荡妇不错, 但我要一个兄弟
Slut would have been better,but I'll settle for bro.

141
00:06:27,806 --> 00:06:31,124
特别是Ted和Victoria在一起不能喝酒
Especially now that Ted's with Victoria and can't drink.

142
00:06:31,498 --> 00:06:33,886
因为他怀孕了
Because he's pregnant.

143
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:36,082
因为他是女的
Cause he's the girl.

144
00:06:36,265 --> 00:06:38,653
得了, Ted不可能怀孕
Oh,come on,Ted can't be pregnant.

145
00:06:38,806 --> 00:06:40,973
得有性生活才能怀孕
You need to have sex to get pregnant.

146
00:06:41,146 --> 00:06:42,259
带劲!
What up!

147
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:45,606
来一个完美的定格!
Freeze frame high five!

148
00:06:47,562 --> 00:06:50,804
我想这也许是个完美的时刻
I think this may be a perfect moment.

149
00:06:50,967 --> 00:06:53,134
我希望我们能保持到永远
I wish we could hold onto it forever.

150
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:54,784
不
No.

151
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:58,553
因为这一刻的美妙就在于它很短暂
Because the beauty of a moment is that it's fleeting.

152
00:06:58,697 --> 00:07:00,605
以其易逝的天性
By its very nature,

153
00:07:00,778 --> 00:07:03,127
...滑过我们的手指...
it... slips through our fingers...

154
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:07,079
让这一刻更珍贵
making it that much more precious.

155
00:07:07,251 --> 00:07:09,093
呃, 太糟糕了
Ugh,that is bad.

156
00:07:09,236 --> 00:07:13,341
那就象, 就象高中文学杂志一样糟
That is,like,high-school- literary-magazine bad.

157
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,739
他们真没激情
And they're not even high.

158
00:07:15,911 --> 00:07:17,714
居然这样也行
It's actually working.

159
00:07:17,877 --> 00:07:21,905
是啊, 缓慢而顺畅
老天啊, 赶快搞定呀!
Yeah,smooth but slowly. 
God,close the deal,already.

160
00:07:22,088 --> 00:07:24,792
已经快有45分钟了, 我们可以做3次啦
It's been,like,45 minutes,we could have had sex three times by now.

161
00:07:24,965 --> 00:07:25,981
是啊, 试试5次
Yeah,try five.

162
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,302
就是!
What up!

163
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,604
也许我们该出去算了
Maybe we should just go out there.

164
00:07:30,853 --> 00:07:31,803
不可能!
No way!

165
00:07:31,956 --> 00:07:33,069
我们现在不能出去
We can'to out there now,

166
00:07:33,232 --> 00:07:35,994
他们会知道我们一直都在浴室里
they'll know that we've been sitting in the bathroom the whole time.

167
00:07:36,128 --> 00:07:37,518
那就有点变态了
It'll be too weird.

168
00:07:37,682 --> 00:07:39,331
好吧
Fine.

169
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,096
但如果我们要困在这儿...
But if we're stuck in here...

170
00:07:41,172 --> 00:07:42,563
我得把音量弄大点
I'm turning up the volume. Shh. Shh.

171
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:51,559
我想要了解你
I want to know you.

172
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:55,242
比如,了解你的灵魂
Like,know your soul.

173
00:07:55,414 --> 00:07:58,617
Ted, 为什么哭了?
Ted,what makes you cry?

174
00:07:58,943 --> 00:08:02,099
你得把我拉住, 否则我要骂人了
Could you hold my hair back,I think I'm going to hurl.

175
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:07,632
那么,你和Ted在雪茄吧里呆过后会干什么?
So. What do you and Ted usually do after the cigar bar?

176
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:09,244
开什么玩笑?
Are you kidding?

177
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:10,634
Ted没来过
Ted's never been here.

178
00:08:10,797 --> 00:08:14,298
你做的已经比他更快更高了
You've already flown higher and faster than he ever did.

179
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,285
还有...
Still...

180
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:16,542
什么?
what?

181
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,055
呃
Eh.

182
00:08:19,764 --> 00:08:22,574
还有一件我们可以做的事
There is one other thing we could do.

183
00:08:22,747 --> 00:08:25,087
如果你准备好
If you're up for it.

184
00:08:28,194 --> 00:08:30,045
没想到现在还有激光枪战!
I had no idea laser tag still existed!

185
00:08:30,247 --> 00:08:32,040
是啊, 好好享受吧,有朝一日会再次火起来的
Yeah,well,enjoy it before it becomes cool again.

186
00:08:32,213 --> 00:08:32,970
我认为两个月以后
I give it two months.

187
00:08:33,124 --> 00:08:34,236
噢，我信你, 这太棒了!
Oh,I believe it,this is awesome!

188
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,819
好了, 跟着我, 低点
Okay,follow my lead,stay low,

189
00:08:35,991 --> 00:08:38,226
不要低估12岁的家伙..
and never underestimate a 12-year-old with a...

190
00:08:38,763 --> 00:08:41,563
Scherbotsky, 你得专心点!
Scherbotsky,you gotta focus!

191
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:43,491
你刚救了我一命, 是吗?
You just saved my life,didn't you?

192
00:08:43,663 --> 00:08:44,843
等会再谢我
Thank me later.

193
00:08:44,977 --> 00:08:46,215
继续行动.
Let's keep moving.

194
00:08:46,358 --> 00:08:48,794
这些小王八蛋无处不在
These little bastards are everywhere

195
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:55,469
他只是凝视着她的眼睛
he's just staring into her eyes.

196
00:08:55,623 --> 00:09:00,667
我不知道,我们以前比Ted和Victoria更恶心
I don't know,we used to be even more nauseatingly into each other than Ted and Victoria.

197
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,036
- 现在看看我们
- 是啊...
- Now look at us.
- Yeah...

198
00:09:03,218 --> 00:09:05,616
现在我们只会嘲笑人们那样
now we just make fun of people like that.

199
00:09:05,798 --> 00:09:07,870
这是生命的轮回
It's the circle of life.

200
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:09,922
别, 我认真的, Marshall
No,I'm serious,Marshall.

201
00:09:10,085 --> 00:09:13,058
我是说, 我们都提不起兴趣出门
I mean,we couldn't even get it up to go on our big trip.

202
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,280
然后现在我们困在浴室里庆祝我们的纪念日
And now we're celebrating our anniversary stuck in a bathroom.

203
00:09:16,443 --> 00:09:19,196
拿我们跟Ted和Victoria比不公平
Well,it's not fair to compare us to Ted and Victoria.

204
00:09:19,378 --> 00:09:21,239
这是他们的第一次
This is their first time.

205
00:09:21,392 --> 00:09:24,269
是, 但是我们还是可以多浪漫点
Yeah,but we could still have some more romance.

206
00:09:24,451 --> 00:09:28,604
现在, 你就说,"想做吗?"
然后我说, "好啊"
Now,you just say,"want to do it?" And I say,"yeah."

207
00:09:29,266 --> 00:09:32,881
- 想...
- 不!
- Want to...
- no!

208
00:09:33,054 --> 00:09:37,945
也许我们只是用光了第一次
Maybe we're just out of firsts.

209
00:09:45,263 --> 00:09:47,842
好象他们要迎来他们的第一次了
Looks like they're about to have theirs.

210
00:09:53,453 --> 00:09:54,834
我们可以去卧室吗?
Should we take this to the bedroom?

211
00:09:54,987 --> 00:09:57,222
好! 好!
Yes! Yes!

212
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:58,104
好的
Yes.

213
00:09:58,277 --> 00:09:59,840
好! 好!
Yes! Yes!

214
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:06,505
不 不要, 别接!
No. No,don't answer it!

215
00:10:06,688 --> 00:10:07,810
你可以接它
you could answer it.

216
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,066
我们有整晚
We have all night.

217
00:10:09,248 --> 00:10:11,147
你要接吗? 他接了电话!
You're answering it? He's answering it!

218
00:10:11,387 --> 00:10:14,091
别! 上了她! 现在就上了她!
No! Do her! Do her now!

219
00:10:14,264 --> 00:10:17,621
当然, 祝你好运
Sure. Good luck with that.

220
00:10:17,966 --> 00:10:19,836
抱歉
Sorry about that.

221
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:21,898
再来点酒怎么样?
How about a little more wine?

222
00:10:22,071 --> 00:10:24,622
- 我再去拿一瓶
- 谢谢
- I'll get another bottle.
- Thank you.

223
00:10:25,888 --> 00:10:27,556
我也要喝
I need a drink.

224
00:10:27,748 --> 00:10:30,165
这里有止咳糖浆吗?
Do we have any cough syrup in here?

225
00:10:30,357 --> 00:10:32,313
嘘...
Shh...

226
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:38,259
伏击! 伏击!伏击!
Ambush! Ambush! Ambush!

227
00:10:38,432 --> 00:10:41,165
噢, 天, 我们被这些小鬼包围了
oh,god. These brats have us completely surrounded.

228
00:10:41,328 --> 00:10:43,591
我数出9人,也许10人
I counted nine,maybe ten.

229
00:10:43,754 --> 00:10:45,538
我会掩护, 你跑过去
I'll lay down some cover fire,you make a run for it.

230
00:10:45,701 --> 00:10:46,823
不, 绝不放弃一名战友
No. Leave no man behind.

231
00:10:47,006 --> 00:10:48,770
我们要么全出去, 要么都别出去
Either we all get out of here or no one does.

232
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:51,427
- 但我...
- 别逞英雄, Scherbotsky
- But I...
- don't be a hero,Scherbotsky.

233
00:10:51,619 --> 00:10:54,275
另一边见
See you on the other side.

234
00:11:03,252 --> 00:11:04,738
该死
damn.

235
00:11:04,911 --> 00:11:05,582
想来点酥软的椒盐卷饼吗?
Want to go get a soft pretzel?

236
00:11:05,745 --> 00:11:08,152
- 耶
- 好吧
- Yeah.
- All right.

237
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:11,567
Marshall, 我们怎么了?
Marshall,what happened to us?

238
00:11:11,739 --> 00:11:15,911
我们曾凝视对方整晚
We used to just stare into each other's eyes all night long.

239
00:11:16,074 --> 00:11:18,405
我们失去这些了吗?
Have we lost that?

240
00:11:18,903 --> 00:11:20,687
也许
Maybe.

241
00:11:23,727 --> 00:11:26,336
但我想我刚刚找回来了
But I think I just found it.

242
00:11:26,508 --> 00:11:29,040
就在这
Right here.

243
00:11:29,223 --> 00:11:32,128
宝贝, 我要给你燃烧的激情
Baby,I'm giving you sexy smolding

244
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,399
只用一对暗示的眼神
with just a hint of crazy eyes.

245
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:36,693
噢
Oh.

246
00:11:36,876 --> 00:11:43,062
好吧, 准备好接受我的性感透视光
Okay,well,get ready for my sex-ray vision.

247
00:11:46,735 --> 00:11:48,787
你有记得把干洗的衣服拿回来吗?
Did you remember to pick up the dry cleaning?

248
00:11:48,988 --> 00:11:50,619
- 噢, 真该死
- 没事我们可以这样
- Oh,damn it.
- It's all right. We can do this.

249
00:11:50,782 --> 00:11:53,275
我们握着手
Let's just hold hands.

250
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,308
感觉还不错..
This is nice. .

251
00:12:02,271 --> 00:12:03,844
你喜欢这小动作
You love that move.

252
00:12:04,017 --> 00:12:06,088
这才是经典的Marshall
It's a classic Marshall.

253
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,466
好吧, 我们就只能这样了
All right,we totally suck at this.

254
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,555
我们真的, 真的得出去
We really,really need to get out of here.

255
00:12:11,718 --> 00:12:13,549
嗯, 我们不能
Well,we can't.

256
00:12:13,712 --> 00:12:16,916
宝贝, 有件事我必需得做,但我如果在你面前做
Baby,there's something I have to do,and if I do it in front of you,

257
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:20,618
会从本质上改变我们的关系
it'll change the entire nature of our relationship.

258
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,162
那是什么?
What is it?

259
00:12:22,334 --> 00:12:25,326
我要尿尿
I have to pee.

260
00:12:27,137 --> 00:12:28,749
- 太糟了
- 是啊
- This is bad.
- Yeah.

261
00:12:28,921 --> 00:12:31,933
我们9年都没有在对方面前尿尿过
We've gone nine years without peeing in front of each other.

262
00:12:32,076 --> 00:12:35,212
你一直以为时间有得是
You always think there'll be more time.

263
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:36,287
看看我们
Look at us.

264
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,339
我们完全是一对年老的夫妻了
We're basically an old married couple,

265
00:12:38,502 --> 00:12:40,468
而且我们甚至还没结婚
and we're not even married yet.

266
00:12:40,765 --> 00:12:43,067
我们的浪漫火焰正在消逝
The flame of our romance is flickering,

267
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,491
如果我朝上面尿尿,它也许就会永远熄灭了
and if I pee all over it,it might go out forever.

268
00:12:46,654 --> 00:12:48,447
你觉得你能憋多久?
How much longer do you think you can hold it?

269
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:53,549
在他们量变到质变的漫长过程中
我喝了不少mountain dew
I drank a big gulp of Mountain Dew during that Quantum Leap marathon.

270
00:12:53,962 --> 00:12:56,935
噢, 坏了
Oh,boy.

271
00:12:57,913 --> 00:13:00,205
玩激光枪战真的让我回到了从前
Playing laser tag really takes me back.

272
00:13:00,378 --> 00:13:03,245
你知道我很想念什么游戏吗?
军舰棋
you know what game I really miss? Battleship.

273
00:13:03,418 --> 00:13:05,988
- 我从来没输过一次
- 我也是
- I've never lost a game.
- Neither have I.

274
00:13:06,151 --> 00:13:07,628
- 我是靠作弊
- 噢, 对, 我也是
- Of course I cheat.
- Oh,yeah,me,too.

275
00:13:07,801 --> 00:13:10,150
我都是把航母折起来做成L形
The trick is to bend the aircraft carrier so it makes an L.

276
00:13:10,352 --> 00:13:12,903
啊, 我通常是把棋子摞起来
Ah. I always just stacked the ships on top of each other.

277
00:13:13,066 --> 00:13:16,068
不错, 我们可以来一个作弊招数大比拼
Nice. You know,we should have a cheaters grudge match.

278
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,350
我觉得我还是有一定的...
I think I still have a...

279
00:13:18,494 --> 00:13:20,748
注意, 目标出现, 点歌机旁的美女
hello. Target acquired. Hottie by the jukebox.

280
00:13:20,987 --> 00:13:23,299
噢, 好眼光Scherbotsky
Oh,good eye, Scherbotsky.

281
00:13:23,481 --> 00:13:26,214
我给你找了个两点钟方向, 穿蓝色衬衫
I got someone for you. Two o'clock,blue shirt.

282
00:13:27,595 --> 00:13:29,015
那是个女的
That's a woman.

283
00:13:29,187 --> 00:13:30,616
噢, 我错了
Oh,my mistake.

284
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,947
或者...没错?
Or... is it?

285
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:35,162
我们专心对付你的目标吧
Let's just focus on your target.

286
00:13:35,335 --> 00:13:36,438
好
Right.

287
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:40,005
这个我来
I got this one.

288
00:13:43,621 --> 00:13:46,766
老天, 我喜欢你的仔裤
Oh,my god. I love your jeans.

289
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,020
好吧, 这里是女同性恋酒吧吗?
Okay. Is this a lesbian bar?

290
00:13:49,174 --> 00:13:50,363
因为那个穿蓝色衬衫的女的刚刚...
Because that girl with the blue shirt just...

291
00:13:50,535 --> 00:13:53,173
噢, 不是, 我只对男人有兴趣
oh,no. I am all about the dudes.

292
00:13:53,326 --> 00:13:55,100
不过今晚真的挑不到什么好的
Although pickings are pretty slim tonight.

293
00:13:55,273 --> 00:13:59,733
唯一一个看上眼的金发西服小子,还在玩冷若冰霜
Only hot guy here is blondie in the suit,and he's playing hard to get.

294
00:13:59,944 --> 00:14:04,988
是吗? 他现在可是盯着我在
really? Cause he's totally vibing me right now.

295
00:14:05,161 --> 00:14:06,791
一定是仔裤
must be the jeans.

296
00:14:06,973 --> 00:14:09,563
不过, 仔裤就只能帮你这么多了
Well,jeans will only get you so far.

297
00:14:09,726 --> 00:14:12,459
我要和他一起回家
I'm going home with him.

298
00:14:12,584 --> 00:14:14,780
我们走着瞧
we'll see about that.

299
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:28,389
我的上帝, 我讨厌Ted
我太讨厌他了!
oh,my god,I hate Ted. 
I hate him so much.

300
00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:30,355
宝贝, 你为什么不干脆尿了?
Baby,why don't you just go?

301
00:14:30,547 --> 00:14:32,570
无数的夫妻都在对方面前尿过尿
Tons of other couples have peed in front of each other.

302
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:37,279
不, 但我们没有,因为我想保持一定的神秘
No,but we haven't,because I want to keep some of the mystery alive.

303
00:14:37,442 --> 00:14:39,859
你有在我面前放过屁
Well,you have farted in front of me.

304
00:14:39,993 --> 00:14:42,295
是的, 但我都以咳嗽掩护了
Yes,but I always cover it with a cough.

305
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:45,939
你一直都是
You always do.

306
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,192
- 嘿
- 嘿
- Hey.
- Hey.

307
00:14:52,384 --> 00:14:53,362
我们走吧, 去什么别的地方
Let's get out of here. Let's go somewhere else.

308
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:54,503
怎么了?
What happened?

309
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:58,090
有时候我会想玩玩七擒七纵
You sometimes like to do a little catch and release.

310
00:14:58,205 --> 00:14:59,836
但为什么?
But why?

311
00:14:59,989 --> 00:15:01,677
绝不留下战友
Leave no man behind.

312
00:15:01,869 --> 00:15:05,743
要么我们都找到目标, 要么都别
Either we all score or no one scores.

313
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,287
不错
Right on.

314
00:15:07,431 --> 00:15:09,033
嘿,你想玩军舰棋吗?
Hey,you want to go play battleship?

315
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,200
中!
Hit!

316
00:15:24,445 --> 00:15:25,480
Ted
Ted,

317
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:27,082
我再也等不急了
I can't wait any longer.

318
00:15:27,245 --> 00:15:28,895
我们该去卧室吗?
Should we move to the bedroom?

319
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:31,283
没时间过去了
There's no time for that.

320
00:15:33,086 --> 00:15:34,773
他们可以吸对方的手指整个小时
They can suck on each other's fingers for an hour,

321
00:15:34,927 --> 00:15:37,161
却没时间走两步去卧室?
but there's no time to take two steps to the bedroom?

322
00:15:37,334 --> 00:15:39,741
宝贝, 我再也憋不住了
Baby,I can't hold it in any longer.

323
00:15:39,924 --> 00:15:41,487
到时候了
It's time.

324
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:44,019
我知道
I know.

325
00:15:44,517 --> 00:15:46,033
我爱你, Marshall
I love you,Marshall.

326
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:49,583
我爱你, Lily
I love you,Lily. 

327
00:15:52,938 --> 00:15:54,547
来吧
here we go.

328
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:57,656
知道吗, Barney,我今晚当你兄弟很愉快
You know,Barney,I had a surprisingly good time bro-ing out tonight.

329
00:15:57,829 --> 00:15:59,296
嗯, 你是个好兄弟
Well,you make a good bro.

330
00:15:59,469 --> 00:16:01,090
你比Ted更Ted
you're a better Ted than Ted.

331
00:16:01,272 --> 00:16:02,461
嘿, 事实上
Hey,in fact,

332
00:16:02,605 --> 00:16:05,655
你的表现令你得到了Marshall的单身派对的邀请
you have just earned yourself an invite to Marshall's bachelor party.

333
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,717
你甚至不用带蛋糕去
And you don't even have to come out of the cake.

334
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,829
谢谢
Thanks.

335
00:16:08,982 --> 00:16:12,665
还有, 呃, 谢谢你今晚陪我
And,um,thanks for sticking around tonight.

336
00:16:12,886 --> 00:16:14,794
希望你准备好来一场高难度的军舰大战
I hope you're ready for some hard-core battleship.

337
00:16:14,948 --> 00:16:17,384
来吧, 小伙子们
Come on,boys.

338
00:16:18,122 --> 00:16:19,628
高难度?
Hardcore?

339
00:16:19,772 --> 00:16:24,068
玩的就是高难度
（Hardcore也指A片的一个类别）
That's the only way I play.

340
00:16:29,838 --> 00:16:31,784
我找到了, 你准备好...
I found it. Are you ready to...

341
00:16:32,111 --> 00:16:34,134
你在干什么?
what the hell are you doing?

342
00:16:34,316 --> 00:16:36,407
换上出生时的装束
I'm birthday suiting up.

343
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,862
抱歉, 你想帮我脱光吗?
I'm sorry,did you want to undress me?

344
00:16:38,968 --> 00:16:41,423
不! 我认为我们只是象朋友一样出去玩
No! I thought we were just hanging out as friends.

345
00:16:41,576 --> 00:16:44,779
噢, 拜托, 你整晚都在向我投怀送抱
Oh,come on,you have been throwing yourself at me all night.

346
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,618
什么?! 我正好相反!我把别的女孩投进你的怀抱
What?! I did the opposite! I threw some other girl at you.

347
00:16:47,781 --> 00:16:51,301
你邀请我到你公寓来玩"军舰棋"
You invited me up to your apartment to "play battleship."

348
00:16:51,454 --> 00:16:54,332
这不是国际公认的做爱的暗语?
Is that not an internationally recognized term for sex?

349
00:16:54,456 --> 00:16:56,422
不是
No.

350
00:16:56,825 --> 00:16:58,177
太好了
Great.

351
00:16:58,561 --> 00:17:00,671
我希望你开心
I hope you're happy.

352
00:17:00,824 --> 00:17:03,116
你击沉了我的军舰
You sunk my battleship.

353
00:17:06,003 --> 00:17:07,154
我还好
I'm okay.

354
00:17:07,269 --> 00:17:09,129
你呢?
You okay?

355
00:17:11,335 --> 00:17:12,918
我感觉还是一样
I feel the same.

356
00:17:14,164 --> 00:17:16,783
不过, 有一点点异样
And yet,strangely different.

357
00:17:16,917 --> 00:17:19,209
我为我的膀胱高兴
I'm happy for my bladder,

358
00:17:19,382 --> 00:17:21,597
也为我们而难过
yet sad for us.

359
00:17:22,038 --> 00:17:23,621
你必须得那样, 甜心...
You had to do it,sweetie...

360
00:17:23,764 --> 00:17:25,328
为了Ted
for Ted.

361
00:17:25,491 --> 00:17:28,771
还有,嘿，看，至少我们想呆多久都可以了
And,hey,look,at least now we can stay in here as long as it takes.

362
00:17:28,943 --> 00:17:31,945
是啊, 只能牺牲我们的关系
Yeah, I guess our relationship had to take a hit

363
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:35,474
让外面的新一对可以绽放
so a new one out there could blossom.

364
00:17:38,946 --> 00:17:40,260
噢, 糟糕!
Oh,crap!

365
00:17:40,433 --> 00:17:43,060
他们一定听到了
They must have heard that.

366
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:46,455
好了，我猜我们可以出去了
Well,I guess we can come out now.

367
00:17:55,269 --> 00:17:57,427
我不敢相信, 他们走了
I don't believe it. They're gone.

368
00:17:57,571 --> 00:18:01,934
很好, 因为我也得去厕所
Good. Cause I got to take a whiz.

369
00:18:03,699 --> 00:18:05,828
好了, 我和你, 这简直是疯了
Okay,you and me,that's insane.

370
00:18:05,972 --> 00:18:07,401
如果你有想一秒钟...
If you even thought about it for one second...

371
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:10,230
但我想了3秒钟, 这很合情理
but I have thought about it for three seconds,and it makes a lot of sense.

372
00:18:10,383 --> 00:18:12,407
我们都认为婚姻承诺是狗屁
We both think the marriage commitment thing's a drag.

373
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,152
我们都想要舒适和开心的东西
We both want something casual and fun.

374
00:18:14,287 --> 00:18:16,732
还有我们显然相处的很好
And we clearly get along really well.

375
00:18:17,634 --> 00:18:20,674
哇, 这听起来是很合理
Wow,that actually did make a lot of sense.

376
00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:22,736
但Ted会怎么想?
But what about Ted?

377
00:18:22,899 --> 00:18:24,059
我给Ted打了招呼了
I checked with Ted.

378
00:18:24,616 --> 00:18:26,313
Ted, 现在你和Victoria进展的这么顺利
Ted,so now that things with you and Victoria are going pretty well,

379
00:18:26,476 --> 00:18:28,212
我猜以前你喜欢的女孩已经不重要了
是吗?
I assume you're over all the girls you were into before,right?

380
00:18:28,346 --> 00:18:31,204
你沉默我就当是了,那么我要和某人约会
I take your silence as a yes,so say I were to hook up with someone,

381
00:18:31,358 --> 00:18:32,863
我指Robin,你不会介意吧, 是不?
say Robin,you'd be cool with that,right?

382
00:18:33,036 --> 00:18:34,685
当然, 祝你好运
sure. Good luck with that.

383
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:37,236
哈! 完全是在祝福我们
Ha! Totally gave us his blessing.

384
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,800
真的吗?
Really?

385
00:18:38,982 --> 00:18:40,325
真的
Really.

386
00:18:40,612 --> 00:18:43,528
那么Ted完全不在意你对我采取行动?
So Ted didn't care that you wanted to make a move on me?

387
00:18:43,643 --> 00:18:46,587
完全不在意
Didn't care at all.

388
00:18:50,097 --> 00:18:53,118
噢. 噢...
Oh. Oh...

389
00:18:53,252 --> 00:18:53,847
什么?
what?

390
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,593
你喜欢Ted
You like Ted.

391
00:18:55,765 --> 00:18:59,199
- 我没说我喜欢Ted
- 你喜欢Ted
- I didn't say I liked Ted
- you like Ted.

392
00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:02,047
哇, 这真震撼
Wow. This is huge.

393
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,898
Barney, 我不喜欢Ted
Barney,I don't like Ted.

394
00:19:04,099 --> 00:19:05,499
他朝前走了, 我也真心高兴...
He's moved on,and I'm really happy for...

395
00:19:05,653 --> 00:19:09,633
是啊是啊,我们要玩军舰棋还是怎样?
yeah,yeah. Look,are we gonna play battleship or what?

396
00:19:17,564 --> 00:19:19,645
你不会去告诉他的, 是不?
You're not gonna tell him,are you?

397
00:19:21,678 --> 00:19:23,203
不会
No.

398
00:19:23,827 --> 00:19:25,774
这是兄弟原则
That's the bro code.

399
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:30,770
一个兄弟不会告诉另一个兄弟第三个兄弟喜欢他
A bro doesn't tell a mutual bro that a third bro has a crush on him.

400
00:19:30,924 --> 00:19:32,746
就像第三个兄弟不会告诉另一个兄弟
Just like the third bro doesn't tell the mutual br

401
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:36,822
最初的兄弟在她面前剥了光猪
that the original bro went bare pickle in front of her.

402
00:19:37,224 --> 00:19:40,226
这是兄弟为了兄弟
It's quid pro bro.

403
00:19:40,648 --> 00:19:41,578
- A7
- 没中
- A7.
- Miss.

404
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,381
当然
Of course.

405
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:47,381
好了，我们还有一个没有在对方面前那样
Well,we still have one frontier left.

406
00:19:47,467 --> 00:19:50,191
还是赛点
Still got the deuce.

407
00:19:50,296 --> 00:19:53,614
这不能让我感觉更好
Not making me feel better.

408
00:19:54,554 --> 00:19:57,316
嗯，这是一个"第一次"
Well,it certainly was a first.

409
00:19:58,429 --> 00:20:01,037
这就是, 不是吗?
It was,wasn't it?

410
00:20:01,124 --> 00:20:02,869
我们还有第一次
We still have firsts.

411
00:20:03,032 --> 00:20:04,883
当然我们有
Of course we do.

412
00:20:05,008 --> 00:20:08,067
还有你知道吗, 我感觉和你走的更近了
And you know what,I actually feel closer to you now.

413
00:20:08,192 --> 00:20:14,205
我想去了解你，比如, 了解你的灵魂
I want to know you. Like,know your soul.

414
00:20:14,358 --> 00:20:19,125
Marshall, 为什么哭了?
Marshall,what makes you cry?

415
00:20:19,298 --> 00:20:23,556
这一刻是短暂的
This moment is fleeting

416
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,449
因为它被下一刻追逐
because it's being chased by another moment.

417
00:20:27,603 --> 00:20:31,612
噢, 比抓胸部还有效
Oh,just grab my boob already.

418
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,371
拜托, 伙计们, 到房间去
Come on,guys,get a room.

419
00:20:37,107 --> 00:20:39,025
