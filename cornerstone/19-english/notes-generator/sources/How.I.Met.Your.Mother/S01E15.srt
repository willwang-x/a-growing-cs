How.I.Met.Your.Mother
Season 1 Episode 15
老爸老妈浪漫史 第一季 第15集

1
00:00:03,531 --> 00:00:05,765
孩子们, 你们可能不了解Marshall叔叔
Kids,something you might not
know about your uncle Marshall

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,703
他一直很善长玩游戏
is that he's always been
good at games.

3
00:00:08,153 --> 00:00:09,314
我是说, 简直无敌
I mean,unbeatable.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:10,254
Gin!
Gin!

5
00:00:12,536 --> 00:00:13,831
Yahtzee!
Yahtzee!

6
00:00:14,857 --> 00:00:15,797
扑克!
Poker!

7
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:18,828
你不需要在赢的时候叫唤"扑克"
You don't have to shout out
"poker" when you win.

8
00:00:18,933 --> 00:00:20,573
我知道 只是为了好玩
I know.It's just fun to say.

9
00:00:21,292 --> 00:00:24,045
我们最后一致认为Marshall
应该主持我们的游戏之夜
We all finally agreed Marshall
should be running our game nights

10
00:00:24,112 --> 00:00:25,282
而不是和我们一起玩
instead of playing in them.

11
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:28,495
结果他理解成――
"发明自己的游戏"
Which he took to mean,
"invent your own game."

12
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:31,314
就叫"胡诌沼泽"
It's called "Marsh-gammon."

13
00:00:31,544 --> 00:00:33,913
它包含了所有好游戏特征
It combines all the best features
of all the best games

14
00:00:33,961 --> 00:00:36,244
"糖果岛" "我从没" "智力游戏"
Candyland,I never,Pictionary.

15
00:00:36,292 --> 00:00:39,332
- 还有双陆棋
- 不 双陆棋很烂
- Backgammon,obviously.
- No.Backgammon sucks.

16
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,758
我只取了其中的精华部分"胡诌"
I took the only good part of
backgammon,the "gammon",

17
00:00:41,902 --> 00:00:44,443
然后把剩下的丢回垃圾车
and I left the rest of it in
the trash where it belongs.

18
00:00:45,604 --> 00:00:47,973
我真高兴Victoria来了
I'm so excited Victoria's coming.

19
00:00:48,107 --> 00:00:49,536
我去再拿点酒
I'going to go get another round.

20
00:00:49,852 --> 00:00:52,125
好吧, 我想说点今晚的基本规则
Okay,I want to lay down some
ground rules for tonight.

21
00:00:52,173 --> 00:00:55,079
Barney, 我很喜欢Victoria
Barney,I actually like
Victoria...a lot,

22
00:00:55,127 --> 00:00:56,959
所以别说什么尴尬的话...
so don't say anything embarrass...

23
00:00:57,007 --> 00:00:58,081
什么也别说
don't say anything.

24
00:00:58,973 --> 00:01:01,793
伙计们还有, 我没有告诉Victoria
And guys,I haven't exactly
told Victoria

25
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,720
我曾经喜欢Robin
that I used to have a kind
of thing for Robin,

26
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:04,919
所以我们要避免...
so if we could just avoid the...

27
00:01:04,967 --> 00:01:07,969
嗯, 嗯, 嗯
多荒唐啊
well,well,well.
How rich.

28
00:01:08,017 --> 00:01:10,644
你要我在你女朋友面前
You make me promise to be
on my best behavior

29
00:01:10,702 --> 00:01:11,680
谨言慎行
around your girlfriend,

30
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:14,318
但, 你从第一天就对她撒谎了
yet,you have been lying
to her since day one.

31
00:01:14,816 --> 00:01:15,708
打扰
Excuse me.

32
00:01:16,485 --> 00:01:17,962
嗨 义肢商店?
Hi.Leg Warehouse?

33
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,755
对, 我朋友Ted需要点东西站住脚
Yeah,my friend Ted needs
something to stand on.

34
00:01:20,475 --> 00:01:22,258
没有可以让他站住脚的东西吗?
So,nothing for him to stand on?

35
00:01:22,354 --> 00:01:23,563
好吧, 还是非常感谢
Okay,and thanks so much.

36
00:01:24,723 --> 00:01:27,265
Ted, Victoria难道不应该知道
Ted,doesn't Victoria deserve
to know that

37
00:01:27,313 --> 00:01:28,972
你曾喜欢Robin吗?
you once had the hots for Robin?

38
00:01:29,154 --> 00:01:33,172
我有点想把"回马枪"的故事讲出来了
I have half a mind to tell
the story of the re-return.

39
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:35,954
别 我让你保证过的
No.I-I swore you to
secrecy on that.

40
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:37,968
噢, 我嗅到了脏东西
Oh,I am smelling dirt.

41
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:40,020
"回马枪"是什么?
What is the story of the re-return?

42
00:01:40,068 --> 00:01:41,593
没什么 什么都不是
Nothing.It's nothing.

43
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,223
说到挖猛料
And speaking of digging up dirt,

44
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:45,055
你们能不能保证别为难Victoria?
can I count on you two to
behave around Victoria?

45
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:47,472
我们? 我们能做什么?
Us? What would we do?

46
00:01:47,721 --> 00:01:50,262
听着, 呃, 你们老是表现的像家长
Look,um,you guys have always
been like the parents

47
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,078
我父母都还在
that I still have and,

48
00:01:51,126 --> 00:01:52,919
事实上, 我搬来这就是为了避开他们
in fact,moved here to get away from.

49
00:01:53,235 --> 00:01:55,470
无论如何, 我们今晚能跳过审问
However,could we skip the
traditional interrogation

50
00:01:55,556 --> 00:01:57,973
新女朋友的惯例吗?
of the new girlfriend tonight?

51
00:01:58,501 --> 00:01:59,690
- 好吧
- 好吧
- Fine.
- Fine

52
00:01:59,738 --> 00:02:00,678
谢谢
Thank you.

53
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:03,229
- 我去看看Robin
- 好的
- I should go help Robin.
- Okay.

54
00:02:05,204 --> 00:02:06,192
- 嘿
- 嘿
- Hey.
- Hey.

55
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:09,856
你今晚得和Victoria相处,你感觉还好吧?
So,are you going to be okay hanging
out with Victoria tonight?

56
00:02:10,105 --> 00:02:12,244
噢, 当然 她很不错
Oh,sure.She's great.

57
00:02:12,742 --> 00:02:13,183
噢, 怎么?
Oh,what?

58
00:02:13,251 --> 00:02:15,217
因为我说过我喜欢Ted吗?
Because of the whole thing
here I said I liked Ted?

59
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:16,780
别 Victoria很不错
No.Victoria's great.

60
00:02:16,924 --> 00:02:19,734
她很风趣, 她无拘无束
她很不错
She's fun,she's free-spirited,
she's great.

61
00:02:20,184 --> 00:02:22,237
我说了"她很不错"太多次了吗, 是吗?
I said,"she's great" too many
times,didn't I?

62
00:02:22,285 --> 00:02:23,848
你一定很讨厌那个贱人
You must really hate the bitch.

63
00:02:25,191 --> 00:02:27,512
但是如果你在薄荷糖森林附近
but if you roll an even number

64
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:29,257
的时候掷了偶数
while adjacent to the peppermint forest,

65
00:02:29,353 --> 00:02:32,546
那么你就"Marshall出局"
你所有的筹码都回到罐子里
then you "Marshall out,"and all
your chips go into the pot,

66
00:02:32,633 --> 00:02:36,162
还有记住, 如果你说了"什么?"
and remember,if you ever ask
the question "what?,"

67
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,512
那... 你就得罚酒
Then...you got to drink.

68
00:02:38,915 --> 00:02:41,686
- 懂了吗?
- 别, 别...
- Got it?
- No,no...

69
00:02:41,734 --> 00:02:44,410
好吧, 好吧, 别, 别, 我们开始吧
你们很快就会了
okay,okay,no,no,we'll just start,
you guys'll pick it up.

70
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:45,551
新来的先掷
Newbie goes first.

71
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,076
- 掷
- 好吧
- Roll.
- Okay.

72
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,224
3!
Three!

73
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,411
你的自述
You got autobiography.

74
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:53,655
现在, 你得真实的回答一个
Now,that's where you have to
answer a personal question

75
00:02:53,712 --> 00:02:56,522
关于你约会史的私人问题才能前进
about your dating life truthfully i
n order to move on.

76
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,510
Marshall, 拜托
Marshall,come on.

77
00:02:57,606 --> 00:02:59,783
嘿, 是她自己掷了3的
Hey,she's the one who rolled
a three.

78
00:03:01,884 --> 00:03:06,487
Victoria
"你曾经在一段感情里不忠吗?"
Victoria,"have you ever cheated
while in a relationship?"

79
00:03:06,573 --> 00:03:08,232
哇, 好问题
Wow,good question.

80
00:03:08,328 --> 00:03:09,815
- 听着, 你不需要回答这问题
- 没事
- Look,you don't have to answer that.
- It's okay.

81
00:03:09,949 --> 00:03:15,137
呃, 嗯,大学我曾陷入一段非常讨人厌的关系里
Um,well,I was in a really crappy
relationship in college,

82
00:03:15,185 --> 00:03:17,967
在一晚的派对上我吻了他
and I wound up kissing this guy
at a party one night,

83
00:03:18,063 --> 00:03:20,029
我感觉很糟糕
and I felt terrible about it,

84
00:03:20,124 --> 00:03:22,714
所以, 我去跟他说清楚然后分手了
so,I came clean,and we broke up.

85
00:03:24,325 --> 00:03:27,586
Victoria, 这是一个诚实而且成熟的答案
Victoria,that was an honest and mature answer.

86
00:03:27,682 --> 00:03:29,466
你可以提前到达糖山
You may advance to the gumdrop mountains.

87
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:34,740
那么 Victoria,你有没有"回了又回"去找过那个家伙吗?
So Victoria,did you ever re-return to this guy?

88
00:03:34,827 --> 00:03:35,814
什么?
What?

89
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,378
你说了"什么"
你得罚一杯!
you said what,
you got to drink!

90
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,437
噢, Barney, 顺便说下
Oh,Barney,by the way,

91
00:03:40,533 --> 00:03:42,959
我去过那幢82街新楼的一个派对
T went to a party in that new building on 82nd,

92
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:44,350
主人说她认识你
and the host said she knew you.

93
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,699
她叫什么来的?
What is her name?

94
00:03:46,776 --> 00:03:50,612
Shannon?!Shannon,Shannon...
Shannon?!Shannon,Shannon...

95
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:52,981
不, 不记得任何一个Shannon
no,don't remember any Shannon.

96
00:03:53,183 --> 00:03:53,892
是吗?
Really?

97
00:03:53,998 --> 00:03:55,340
嗯, 她给我了一个录象带让我...
Well,cause she gave me a video tape to give...

98
00:03:55,388 --> 00:03:56,750
录象带在哪?
where's the tape?

99
00:03:58,716 --> 00:04:01,037
好的 我去拿
Fine.I'll get it.

100
00:04:01,123 --> 00:04:03,099
酷, 好的,你知道, 随便什么时候都可以
Cool,okay.You know,whenever.

101
00:04:03,502 --> 00:04:06,360
好了, Robin, 到你了
Okay,Robin,your roll.

103
00:04:09,227 --> 00:04:11,462
又一个自述...

- Of course.

106
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:21,167
Victoria, 在Ted之前你有
Victoria,"how many boyfriends
did you have

107
00:04:21,215 --> 00:04:23,268
交往过几个男朋友?
before you started dating Ted?"

108
00:04:23,335 --> 00:04:25,119
等下, 卡片上真的有写"Ted"吗?
Wait,the card actually says "Ted?"

109
00:04:25,214 --> 00:04:26,835
好吧, 呃, 嗯
Okay,uh,well,

110
00:04:26,883 --> 00:04:28,696
男朋友,我想我只有2个
boyfriends,I guess I've only had...two.

111
00:04:28,744 --> 00:04:30,048
假正经
Prude alert.

112
00:04:31,141 --> 00:04:31,985
嗯...
Well...

113

只是真正交往的男朋友

114
00:04:34,134 --> 00:04:35,927
之间我也有和其他家伙在一起
I've dated other guys in between.

115
00:04:36,023 --> 00:04:37,538
噢, 荡妇!
Oh,slut alert!

116
00:04:40,732 --> 00:04:41,815
噢, 太好了, 拿来了

119
00:04:53,851 --> 00:04:55,146
Robin停在了巧克力沼泽
Robin landed on the chocolate swamp.

120
00:04:55,242 --> 00:04:56,537
我得到了5个筹码
That's five chips for me.

121
00:04:56,767 --> 00:04:57,294
谢谢!
Thank you!

122
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,788
终于有人搞懂了胡诌沼泽
Finally somebody understands
Marsh-gammon.

123
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:03,068
Barney, 录象带上有什么?
Barney,what was on that tape?

124
00:05:03,212 --> 00:05:04,382
糟糕你永远也不会知道了
Too bad you' never find out.

125
00:05:04,516 --> 00:05:05,600
噢, 该死!
Oh,damn it!

126
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,662
如果我只给了你个假录象带
If only I'd given you a fake tape

127
00:05:07,892 --> 00:05:09,848
而把真的藏在包里
and hidden the real tape in my purse.

128
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,265
噢, 等等 我就是那样做了
Oh,wait.That's exactly what I did.

129
00:05:12,447 --> 00:05:14,231
- 什么?!
- 罚酒!
- What?!
- drink!

130
00:05:14,586 --> 00:05:16,514
耶, 你表现的太怪异了
Yeah,you were acting so weird
about it,

131
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:18,969
我把Ted的毕业录象拿给你了
I gave you Ted's graduation
tape instead.

132
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:20,599
那么, 我们应该看吗?
So,should we pop it in?

133
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,066
- 把它给我, 把它给我...
- 播那盘带子, 播吧, 播它!
- Give it to me,give it,give me...
- play the tape,play it,play it!

134
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,416
Ted!
好吧, 好吧
Ted!
Fine,fine.

135
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,101
你们最好播不出来
You can not play it.

136
00:05:30,362 --> 00:05:33,038
Shannon! 我爱你!
Shannon!I love you!

137
00:05:33,373 --> 00:05:35,646
我那么爱你
I love you so much.

138
00:05:37,258 --> 00:05:40,211
我们一起来改变世界吧?
What about us changing the world together?

139
00:05:40,701 --> 00:05:42,753
别告诉我你忘记了
Don't tell me you've forgotten.

140
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:44,364
我知道我还没有
I know I haven't.

141
00:05:47,318 --> 00:05:52,813
will I ever see another rainbow?
will I ever see another rainbow?

142
00:05:52,995 --> 00:05:59,200
Will an eagle ever soar through
this tempest of woe?
Will an eagle ever soar through
this tempest of woe?

143
00:05:59,296 --> 00:06:04,293
Baby,please don't go!
Baby,please don't go!

144
00:06:06,144 --> 00:06:08,561
there's a thief in the palace,
she's stolen all my love
there's a thief in the palace,
she's stolen all my love

145
00:06:08,705 --> 00:06:11,064
there's a thief in the palace
and she's...
there's a thief in the palace
and she's...

146
00:06:20,061 --> 00:06:21,356
你打他手机了吗?
Did you try his cell phone?

147
00:06:21,538 --> 00:06:22,929
有啊, 我留了两条言
Yeah,I left two messages.

148
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:24,780
我找过雪茄吧 激情美洲豹
I checked the cigar club,the lusty leopard.

149
00:06:24,962 --> 00:06:26,257
他消失了
He's off the grid.

150
00:06:27,686 --> 00:06:29,297
嘿, 伙计们, 在干嘛?
Hey,guys,what up?

151
00:06:29,403 --> 00:06:30,697
Barney, 你去哪了?
Barney,where have you been?

152
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:32,596
是啊, 我们-我们都感到很抱歉
Yeah,we're-we're really sorry
about that.

153
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,217
是啊, 很抱歉
Yeah,so sorry.

154
00:06:34,485 --> 00:06:37,257
但是说真的, 那录象带是怎么回事?
But seriously,what was up with the tape?

155
00:06:37,612 --> 00:06:38,974
别, 别, 留下
拜托, Barney
No,no,stay.
Come on,Barney.

156
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,134
拜托 留下!
抱歉
Come on.Stay!
I'm sorry.

157
00:06:40,182 --> 00:06:40,997
我不想谈这个
I don't want to talk about it.

158
00:06:41,132 --> 00:06:42,570
那是我这辈子最尴尬
It was the most embarrassing,

159
00:06:42,704 --> 00:06:44,622
最丢脸的事
and humiliating thing that ever happened to me.

160
00:06:44,757 --> 00:06:46,502
嗯, 我们都有尴尬的故事
Well,we all have embarrassing stories.

161
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:48,296
有时候谈谈也有好处
Sometimes it's good to talk about it.

162
00:06:48,392 --> 00:06:49,283
噢, 是吗?
Oh,really?

163
00:06:49,427 --> 00:06:52,324
那为什么不告诉我们
你最难堪的时刻呢, Marshall?
Then why don't you tell us your
most humiliating moment,Marshall?

164
00:06:52,467 --> 00:06:54,213
告诉我有多好
Show me how good it is.

165
00:06:56,064 --> 00:06:57,579
好吧
All right.

166
00:06:58,346 --> 00:07:00,840
那天我顺路去Lily幼儿园打个招呼
I was stopping by Lily's kindergart
class to say hi,

167
00:07:01,032 --> 00:07:02,873
但他们都出去休息了
but they were all at recess.

168
00:07:03,103 --> 00:07:06,009
我很想尿尿, 所以我走进了教室的厕所
I really had to pee,so I went
into the class's restroom.

169
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,027
那里的圈圈看起来不好瞄
It was a-a smaller target
than I'm used to,

170
00:07:10,162 --> 00:07:12,262
所以我决定蹲下来
so I figured I should sit down.

171
00:07:13,739 --> 00:07:17,460
我没有注意到的是,
那是一个共用的浴室
What I didn't realize was,
it was a shared bathroom.

172
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,406
我真希望当时把裤子提上了
I wish I'd pulled up my pants.

173
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,980
孩子们还是叫他搞笑屁股
the kids still call him funny butt.

174
00:07:33,677 --> 00:07:34,435
好吧
Okay.

175
00:07:35,106 --> 00:07:36,670
我告诉你们我的故事
I'll tell you my story.

176
00:07:37,034 --> 00:07:41,321
信不信由你们
我的生活不是一开始就象现在这样棒
Believe it or not,
I was not always as awesome as I am today.

177
00:07:41,944 --> 00:07:43,575
那年是1998
It was 1998.

178
00:07:43,661 --> 00:07:44,917
我刚从大学毕业
I was just out of college,

179
00:07:45,013 --> 00:07:47,382
我和我的女朋友在一间咖啡屋工作
and I was working at a coffeehouse
with my girlfriend.

180
00:07:47,526 --> 00:07:49,550
我的女朋友... Shannon
My girlfriend...Shannon.

181
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:52,657
Yeah, you were meant for me
Yeah,you were meant for me

182
00:07:52,983 --> 00:07:57,222
and I was meant for you
and I was meant for you

183
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:00,483
谢谢
Thank you.

184
00:08:04,549 --> 00:08:05,393
好的
All right.

185
00:08:05,757 --> 00:08:07,455
我喜欢你的歌声, Barney
I love your singing,Barney.

186
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,507
我爱你, Shannon
And I love you,Shannon.

187
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,267
和你一起加入国际和平组织
这将成为传奇性事件
joining the Peace Corps with you
is gonna be legendary.

188
00:08:13,353 --> 00:08:14,168
我知道
I know.

189
00:08:14,254 --> 00:08:17,208
离我们去尼加拉瓜只有短短3周了
Only five short weeks till
we're down in Nicaragua.

190
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:19,798
嘿, 低脂拿铁打包
Hey,nonfat latte to go.

191
00:08:20,114 --> 00:08:21,361
真会点, 伙计
Mellow order,bro

192
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:22,617
真会点
mellow order.

193
00:08:24,094 --> 00:08:27,221
伙计, 那是你女朋友吗?
不错, 值得击掌!
Dude,that your g-friend?
All right,high five!

194
00:08:27,403 --> 00:08:29,906
抱歉, 我习惯用V字手势
Sorry,I only give high twos.

195
00:08:30,894 --> 00:08:31,651
随便吧
Whatevers.

196
00:08:31,747 --> 00:08:33,090
当你把她放倒的时候
As long as you're nailing that.

197
00:08:33,934 --> 00:08:36,303
看看你说的 放倒?
Listen to you. That?

198
00:08:36,437 --> 00:08:38,182
你要知道, 女人不是物品
You know,women aren't objects.

199
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:39,573
她们是人
They're human beings.

200
00:08:39,755 --> 00:08:42,747
还有, Shannon和我认为应该等到我们结婚的时候
And FYI,Shannon and I have decided
to wait till we're married.

201
00:08:42,891 --> 00:08:44,627
你能在我的幻想杂志中读到
You can read about it in my zine.

202
00:08:45,433 --> 00:08:46,843
嘿, 小辫子, 听我说
Hey,haircut,right here.

203
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:48,895
打开你智慧的库门
我送你一些
Open up your knowledge basket,
cause here it comes.

204
00:08:48,991 --> 00:08:50,333
去他的狗屁感情
Forget that touchy-feely crap.

205
00:08:50,381 --> 00:08:51,398
有钱就有马子
You get money,you get laid.

206
00:08:51,436 --> 00:08:52,520
就这么牛
End of discussion.

207
00:08:52,654 --> 00:08:54,400
我为你感到痛惜, 伙计
I feel sorry for you,man.

208
00:08:54,544 --> 00:08:56,462
我们井水河水啦, 老兄
Peace out, hombre.

209
00:08:58,198 --> 00:08:59,857
西装男
suits.

210
00:09:01,688 --> 00:09:04,767
5周后, 我们准备好去国际和平
Five weeks later,we were all set
to leave for the Peace Corps.

211
00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:06,244
唯一的问题是...
Only problem was...

212
00:09:07,232 --> 00:09:09,150
她没有出现
she never showed up.

213
00:09:15,026 --> 00:09:16,455
她一直没出现吗?
she never showed?

214
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:18,555
那后来怎么样了?
So,what happened next?

215
00:09:19,409 --> 00:09:21,384
你们知道吗? 这是个错误
You know what?This was a mistake.

216
00:09:21,471 --> 00:09:25,201
那谁把自己的最丢脸的故事说出来怎样?
what if somebody else told their
most humiliating story?

217
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:26,889
噢, 我知道怎么决定谁说
Oh,I know just how to decide who.

218
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,335
你把游戏带到酒吧来了?
You brought the game to the bar?

219
00:09:29,431 --> 00:09:31,310
虽然Ted领先很多
我们也不该放弃啊
Well,we're not quitting just
cause Ted's so far ahead.

220
00:09:31,397 --> 00:09:32,433
我领先?
I was winning?

221
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:39,261
好吧 我来说
fine.I'll go next.

222
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,924
我当时正在做一个关于出租司机
的电视直播报道
I was doing a report on live TV
about a hansom cab driver.

223
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,121
不要听掉进马粪的故事!
Not the slipping-in-horse-poop
story!

224
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:46,511
对, 我们都知道那个
Yeah,we all know that one.

225
00:09:46,655 --> 00:09:48,257
好了, 这样怎么样?
Okay,how about this?

226
00:09:48,343 --> 00:09:51,134
我来告诉你们我最丢脸的故事
I will tell you my most
humiliating story.

227
00:09:51,201 --> 00:09:53,081
耶, Victoria, 十分期待
Yeah,Victoria,way to step up!

228
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:55,517
好了, 它包括了真心话大冒险
Okay,it involves a game of
truth or dare,

229
00:09:55,699 --> 00:09:58,614
一软瓶的糖汁用于冰激凌的点缀的
a squeeze-bottle of marshmallow
ice cream topping,

230
00:09:58,758 --> 00:10:01,798
我父母的老人俱乐部浴缸
and the hot tub at my grandparents'
retirement community.

231
00:10:02,825 --> 00:10:04,925
孩子们, 我告诉你们
很多不该说的故事
Kids,I tell you a lot of
inappropriate stories,

232
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,179
但是别想我会告诉你们这个
but there's no way in hell
I'm telling you this one.

233
00:10:07,265 --> 00:10:09,145
但别担心
那故事也不是那么棒
Don't worry,though,
it wasn't that great.

234
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:13,575
这是最棒的故事!
That is the greatest story ever!

235
00:10:13,662 --> 00:10:16,261
- 噢 我的天那!
- 哇, 哇!
- Oh my god!
- Wow,wow!

236
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:19,119
Victoria, 我认为你的故事...
Victoria,I deem your offering...

237
00:10:19,349 --> 00:10:20,289
值得
worthy.

238
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,012
我的传奇故事...
My saga...

239
00:10:23,242 --> 00:10:24,576
继续下去
continues.

240
00:10:25,381 --> 00:10:28,306
我回咖啡屋去找Shannon
I went back to the coffeehouse
to find Shannon.

241
00:10:28,488 --> 00:10:29,294
Barney
Barney.

242
00:10:29,438 --> 00:10:30,819
宝宝熊, 你去哪了?
Sugar bear,where were you?

243
00:10:30,905 --> 00:10:32,401
噢, 我很抱歉
Oh,I'm sorry.

244
00:10:32,584 --> 00:10:34,684
我爸爸不让我去
My dad won't let me go.

245
00:10:34,962 --> 00:10:37,407
但尼加拉瓜人民需要我们!
But the Nicaraguans need us!

246
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:40,544
但是他仍然在经济上支持我, 还有...
It's just,he's still supporting me,and...

247
00:10:40,592 --> 00:10:42,375
听着, 他马上就要来和我谈这个了
look,he's coming by soon to talk about it,

248
00:10:42,471 --> 00:10:45,157
我觉得你应该自己上路
but I think you should go on
without me.

249
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:46,422
Shannon, 没有...
Shannon,there is no...

250
00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:48,926
Barney, 这是你的梦想
Barney,it's your dream.

251
00:10:49,108 --> 00:10:52,992
只有两年
我知道我们可以做到
It's only two years.
I know we can make it.

252
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:59,034
当我走开的时候, 我意识到
Shannon成年了
As I walked away,I realized
Shannon was an adult.

253
00:10:59,216 --> 00:11:01,316
她的父亲不能控制她的生活
Her father couldn't control her life.

254
00:11:01,604 --> 00:11:04,107
我要回去说服他
I had to go back and confront him.

255
00:11:07,943 --> 00:11:10,763
她正在和她爸爸争吵着
She was in the middle of a heated
argument with her dad.

256
00:11:18,435 --> 00:11:19,394
什么?!
What?!

257
00:11:21,677 --> 00:11:23,058
我们都得罚酒了
now we all got to drink.

258
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:29,013
噢, 我的天
后来怎样了?
oh,my god.
What happened next?

259
00:11:29,915 --> 00:11:32,811
- 我不知道, 伙计们
- 好吧, 好吧
- I don't know,guys.
- Okay,okay.

260
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,691
Marshall的妈妈给我们寄来饼干...
Marshall's mom sent us cookies...

261
00:11:34,787 --> 00:11:35,918
Lily, 别!
Lily,no!

262
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,134
为了团队, Marshall
为了团队
For the team,Marshall,
for the team.

263
00:11:39,064 --> 00:11:41,260
嘿, Eriksen夫人, 我是Lily
Hey,mrs.Eriksen,it's Lily.

264
00:11:41,346 --> 00:11:44,252
谢谢你如此美味的饼干
Thank you so much for the delicious cookies.

265
00:11:44,435 --> 00:11:46,717
蛋黄酱 真的吗?
Mayonnaise.Really?

266
00:11:46,966 --> 00:11:48,750
真想不到
Never would have guessed.

267
00:11:48,884 --> 00:11:52,011
嗯, 我会代你给Marshall一个吻的
Well,I will definitely give
Marshall a kiss for you.

268
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:53,354
好的 保重
Okay.Take care.

269
00:11:53,987 --> 00:11:56,797
噢, 糟糕 我妈送来饼干吗?
Oh,crap.My mom sent cookies?

270
00:11:56,931 --> 00:12:01,630
是啊 我真希望我们有只狗
那就可以不用扔掉了
Yeah.I wish we had a dog,
so they wouldn't go to waste.

271
00:12:01,803 --> 00:12:04,891
那么所有的地方都是我们的了
So we've got the whole place
to ourselves.

272
00:12:04,977 --> 00:12:07,461
我在考虑地板激情
I'm thinking floor sex.

273
00:12:07,547 --> 00:12:08,756
听起来合理
Sounds reasonable.

274
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:12,429
噢, 地板很凉
Oh,floor's cold.

275
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:14,980
把你妈妈做的毛毯抓来
Grab that afghan your mom made.

276
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:18,998
从头到尾吗?
The whole time?

277
00:12:19,228 --> 00:12:22,892
从... 头... 到尾
The... whole... time.

278
00:12:23,563 --> 00:12:25,961
Barney, 那对我们两来说都很难堪
Barney,that was really embarrassing
for both of us.

279
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:27,620
我们应该赢得了一大块故事
We just earned a huge chunk of story.

280
00:12:27,802 --> 00:12:30,075
好 我刚到哪了?
Right.So where was I?

281
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:33,518
噢, 对 Shannon在和她爸爸热吻
Oh,yeah.Shannon was sucking face
with her dad.

282
00:12:41,689 --> 00:12:44,259
怎么能和你爸爸...?
How can...with your dad?

283
00:12:44,394 --> 00:12:46,858
虽然我们不该评判别人
I mean,I know judge not lest
ye be judged,

284
00:12:46,993 --> 00:12:48,690
但好恶心啊!
but gross!

285
00:12:48,824 --> 00:12:50,704
Barney, 那不是我爸爸
Barney,that's not my dad.

286
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,414
他叫Greg
His name's Greg.

287
00:12:51,462 --> 00:12:52,852
我和他一起几周了
I've been seeing him for a few weeks.

288
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,684
我原希望你走了就好了
I was hoping you'd just leave,

289
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,123
我们就可以避免这样了
and we could avoid all this.

290
00:12:57,283 --> 00:12:58,530
我们分手了吗?
We're breaking up?

291
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,247
但是和国际和平怎么办?
But what about the Peace Corps?

292
00:13:00,295 --> 00:13:03,757
这些只不过是人生的一个阶段
Yeah,all this granola business,
it was just a phase.

293
00:13:03,939 --> 00:13:05,282
Greg更成熟
Greg's older.

294
00:13:05,464 --> 00:13:06,854
他有事业
He's successful.

295
00:13:06,989 --> 00:13:09,664
他给我买了所有这些东西
He buys me all this cool stuff.

296
00:13:10,604 --> 00:13:11,678
但我爱你
But I love you.

297
00:13:12,618 --> 00:13:14,143
但他有艘船
But he has a boat.

298
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:18,056
你应该去和平队
You should go to the Peace Corps

299
00:13:18,171 --> 00:13:19,600
然后忘了我
and forget about me.

300
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,328
我没有走
I didn't go.

301
00:13:24,913 --> 00:13:28,366
那晚, 我录了录像带送给Shannon
That night,I recorded my video
and mailed it to Shannon.

302
00:13:28,816 --> 00:13:30,782
直到一周后我才见到她
I didn't see her until a week later.

303
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,372
篮子里有糖
There's sugar in the basket.

304
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,729
Shannon!
Shannon!

305
00:13:37,045 --> 00:13:38,388
Shannon, 你回来了!
Shannon,you came back!

306
00:13:38,522 --> 00:13:40,354
我只是来领我最后的工资
I'm just picking up my last paycheck.

307
00:13:40,785 --> 00:13:43,509
你有没...
Did you...

308
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:44,813
你有没收到我的录象带?
did you get my tape?

309
00:13:45,187 --> 00:13:46,664
噢, 她收到了录象带
Oh,she got the tape.

310
00:13:47,431 --> 00:13:51,133
你? 是你?
You?It was you?

311
00:13:51,335 --> 00:13:54,941
我能再看见另一条彩虹吗
Will I ever see another rainbow

312
00:14:13,413 --> 00:14:16,176
穿上西装!
Suit up!

313
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,824
噢, 可怜的东西
oh,you poor thing.

314
00:15:13,007 --> 00:15:14,436
故事还没完
The story's not over.

315
00:15:14,637 --> 00:15:16,641
我还见过一次Shannon
I did see Shannon one more time.

316
00:15:16,776 --> 00:15:18,483
- 什么时候?
- 抱歉
- When?
- sorry.

317
00:15:20,756 --> 00:15:22,453
你得告诉我们
You've got to tell us.

318
00:15:22,731 --> 00:15:23,757
我不知道
I don't know,

319
00:15:23,892 --> 00:15:27,824
我想得用最后一个故事来帮我下
I think I might need one last
story to get me through it.

320
00:15:29,483 --> 00:15:30,557
好吧
Fine.

321
00:15:31,046 --> 00:15:32,926
绿色睾丸的故事
The green testicle story.

322
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,844
那是我在大学时候正玩着终极飞盘
So I was playing ultimate frisbee in college

323
00:15:34,988 --> 00:15:37,222
有一个光着脚而且脚趾特别长尖的家伙...
and there was this barefoot dude
with weirdly sharp toenails...

324
00:15:37,318 --> 00:15:38,747
噢, 拜托, Ted!
oh,come on,Ted!

325
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,579
你知道我想听哪个故事
You know what story I want to hear.

326
00:15:40,819 --> 00:15:43,446
在这里的每个人都有勇气说出事实
Everyone else here has manned up
tonight and told the truth.

327
00:15:43,629 --> 00:15:44,703
为什么你不行?
Why can't you?

328
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,158
你是对的
You're right.

329
00:15:48,386 --> 00:15:50,793
Victoria, 我很抱歉我没告诉你这个
Victoria,I'm sorry I haven't
told you this yet,

330
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:55,089
但是之前, 我曾喜欢Robin
but a while back,I was kind
of into Robin.

331
00:15:55,578 --> 00:15:57,007
事实是, 我们第一次约会那天
In fact,on our first date,

332
00:15:57,103 --> 00:15:59,827
我可能说了 "我爱你"
I might have said,"I love you."

333
00:16:00,594 --> 00:16:03,366
很容易理解, 她吃惊了我离开了
Understandably,she freaked out
and I left.

334
00:16:04,075 --> 00:16:07,701
但不幸的是, 那一晚并不是完结点
But unfortunately,the night
did not end there.

335
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:12,438
我们和司机Ranjit一起在酒吧喝酒
We all ended up at the bar
with our cab driver Ranjit.

336
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:14,539
为这带劲的一晚!
To one hell of a night!

337
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:20,168
我喝了很多酒
and I drank...a lot.

338
00:16:23,112 --> 00:16:25,126
你们觉得我应该吻她吗?
So you guys think I should
have kissed her?

339
00:16:25,395 --> 00:16:27,188
嗯, 我跟你们说
Well,I'll tell you what,

340
00:16:27,409 --> 00:16:30,564
我现在就去吻她
I'm gonna go kiss her right...now.

341
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,943
好! 去吧!
Yes!Do it!

342
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,237
上车去
To the cab.

343
00:16:51,289 --> 00:16:52,421
喂?
Hello?

344
00:16:52,507 --> 00:16:53,984
有人在外面吗?
Is someone out there?

345
00:17:03,498 --> 00:17:05,377
你吐了然后跑了
you ralphed and ran?

346
00:17:06,001 --> 00:17:08,369
我以为你是"93年起免吐王"
I thought you were vomit-free
since 93.

347
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,163
是骗人的?
So that was a lie?

348
00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:13,577
你回来找我了
You re-returned for me.

349
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:15,831
这太贴心了
That's really sweet.

350
00:17:16,013 --> 00:17:19,092
尽管你某种程度上
毁了我定做的Scherbotsky擦鞋垫
Though you kind of ruined my
customized Scherbotsky doormat.

351
00:17:19,207 --> 00:17:21,125
- 抱歉
- 没事
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

352
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:23,896
Victoria, 我知道这一定...
Victoria,I know this must be...

353
00:17:23,944 --> 00:17:26,850
是啊 确实
yeah.It kinda is.

354
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,348
哇, Ted, 你对了
Wow,Ted,you were right.

355
00:17:31,396 --> 00:17:32,835
你不该讲这个故事
You shouldn't have told that story.

356
00:17:34,033 --> 00:17:36,728
但你赢得了我的故事结尾
But you did earn yourself the
right to the end of mine.

357
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,500
我们快进到8年后
We fast-forward eight years into the future.

358
00:17:39,644 --> 00:17:40,622
等等, 8年
Wait,eight years,

359
00:17:40,804 --> 00:17:42,415
那不是, 那不就是今年
that's,that's this year.

360
00:17:42,598 --> 00:17:44,650
Marshall, 不仅是今年
Marshall,not only is it this year,

361
00:17:44,784 --> 00:17:46,175
是今晚
it's tonight.

362
00:17:55,564 --> 00:17:56,446
嗨
Hi.

363
00:17:57,894 --> 00:18:00,532
- Barney?
- 嗨, Shannon
- Barney?
- Hi,Shannon.

364
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:02,853
- 你来干什么?
- 你听着
- What are you doing here?
- Just listen.

365
00:18:03,035 --> 00:18:04,962
当你为了Greg离开我后
When you left me for that guy Greg,

366
00:18:05,116 --> 00:18:06,727
改变了我
it changed me.

367
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,163
现在我是这样的
Now I'm this.

368
00:18:10,362 --> 00:18:11,887
我-我知道这很疯狂
I-I know this is crazy.

369
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,227
只是, 你曾经是我生命的一大部分
It's just,you were once such
a big part of my life.

370
00:18:14,371 --> 00:18:16,691
但你现在却不知道我是怎样的
And it just seemed insane that
you didn't know who I am now.

371
00:18:16,778 --> 00:18:19,195
所以我就来了
So here I am.

372
00:18:21,026 --> 00:18:22,858
然后她告诉了我她的事
And then she told me about her life.

373
00:18:22,992 --> 00:18:25,697
她和Greg约会了一段时间然后分了
She and Greg dated for a while
and then split up.

374
00:18:25,831 --> 00:18:29,188
但是有点震惊的是
Shannon现在是妈妈了
But here's the real kicker:
Shannon's a mom.

375
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,739
她的孩子叫Max
She has a little kid named Max.

376
00:18:31,921 --> 00:18:33,302
这太疯狂了
That's crazy.

377
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,959
那本可能是我的孩子
That could have been my kid.

378
00:18:36,237 --> 00:18:38,644
但取而代之, 我有什么?
But instead,what do I have?

379
00:18:38,836 --> 00:18:41,013
我一辈子就只有银行里的存款
My whole life's some money
in the bank,

380
00:18:41,147 --> 00:18:45,089
衣橱里的西装和一打一夜情
some suits in my closet and
a string of one-night stands.

381
00:18:45,933 --> 00:18:47,918
嘿 别这样
Hey.Come on.

382
00:18:48,014 --> 00:18:51,140
她选了她的生活方式,你的是另一种方式
I mean,just because her life went
one way and yours went another,

383
00:18:51,274 --> 00:18:53,969
但并没有让你的生活更糟
it doesn't make your life
any worse.

384
00:18:55,091 --> 00:18:57,326
我的生活棒透了!
My life rocks!

385
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:00,184
钱, 西装和性
Money,suits and sex.

386
00:19:00,328 --> 00:19:01,929
这是我愉快的眼泪!
These are tears of joy!

387
00:19:02,428 --> 00:19:04,663
我可能被困在狭小的公寓里
I could be cooped up
in some tiny apartment

388
00:19:04,701 --> 00:19:06,984
给乳臭未干的小鬼换尿布
changing some brat's poopy diapers.

389
00:19:07,118 --> 00:19:10,791
但取而代之的是,我仍行走在这精彩的世界 24-7-365!
But instead,I'm out in the world
being awesome 24-7,365!

390
00:19:10,877 --> 00:19:12,584
你让我避开了子弹, 大块头
You let me dodge a bullet,big guy.

391
00:19:13,658 --> 00:19:16,775
另外, 再给点精华之中的精华
Plus,here's the mini-cherry
on top of the regular cherry

392
00:19:16,871 --> 00:19:19,557
我的精彩生活中的精华
on top of the sundae of awesomeness
that is my life.

393
00:19:19,662 --> 00:19:22,299
我和Shannon谈过后, 我上了她
After Shannon and I talked,I nailed her.

394
00:19:23,115 --> 00:19:24,505
- 不是
- 是
- Nope.
- Yeah.

395
00:19:24,592 --> 00:19:25,196
- 不是
- 是
- Nope.
- Yeah.

396
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,433
抱歉 我不信
Sorry. no buy it.

397
00:19:26,529 --> 00:19:27,737
你在说谎
You're making it up.

398
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,435
你只是在试图掩饰真相
You're just trying to cover the fact

399
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:32,705
你确实有一刻对自己产生了怀疑还有...
that you actually had a profound
moment of doubt about yourself and...

400
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:34,038
噢, 天那
oh,my god.

401
00:19:34,124 --> 00:19:35,246
噢,Barney
Oh,Barney

402
00:19:35,381 --> 00:19:37,270
这摄象头很不错吧, 哈?
video's pretty good on this phone,huh?

403
00:19:37,471 --> 00:19:38,939
你电话开着在吗?
Is your phone on?

404
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:40,809
噢, 没有 只是要过会才能待机
Oh,no.It just takes a while to power down.

405
00:19:41,749 --> 00:19:43,533
哟, 恶心 别放了
Ew,gross.Just stop it.

406
00:19:45,671 --> 00:19:48,644
女士们, 先生们... Ted
ladies,gentlemen...Ted.

407
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,234
这是一个精彩的夜晚
This has been a wonderful evening.

408
00:19:51,368 --> 00:19:52,845
我挖出了你们的猛料
I got great dirt on all you guys.

409
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,504
我让Ted讲述了"回马枪"的故事
I got Ted to tell the re-return.

410
00:19:54,686 --> 00:19:56,786
我终于上了Shannon!
I finally nailed Shannon!

411
00:19:56,882 --> 00:19:57,909
告诉她我明天打给她
Told her I'd call her tomorrow.

412
00:19:58,043 --> 00:19:59,165
耶, 棒
Yeah,right.

413
00:19:59,702 --> 00:20:03,231
我还发现我的生活到底有多棒
And I rediscovered just how
awesomely awesome my life is.

414
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,756
不带一片云彩
Peace out,hombres!

415
00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:10,942
我想游戏之夜Barney赢了
I think Barney just won game night.

416
00:20:11,172 --> 00:20:16,025
我们花那么多工夫试图掩盖一部分事实
We spend so much effort trying to
keep parts of our lives hidden,

417
00:20:16,207 --> 00:20:17,952
甚至对我们最亲近的朋友
even from our closest friends.

418
00:20:18,087 --> 00:20:20,369
这是少有的敞开心怀的时刻
But thosrare times when we do open up,

419
00:20:20,504 --> 00:20:23,803
令人惊奇的是这些故事结局都那么相似
it's amazing how minor those secrets all end up seeming.

420
00:20:24,925 --> 00:20:26,315
Right? Right?
Right?Right?

421
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:27,083
You've got
You've got

422
00:20:27,178 --> 00:20:27,869
to want
to want

423
00:20:28,032 --> 00:20:29,854
to rearrange and keep it
to rearrange and keep it

424
00:20:29,998 --> 00:20:31,197
off the record
off the record

425
00:20:31,293 --> 00:20:32,875
off the record
off the record

426
00:20:33,067 --> 00:20:35,426
当然, 那天不是每个秘密都戳破了
of course,not every secret was told that night.

427
00:20:36,721 --> 00:20:39,003
但正是有秘密才会有故事发生
But that's getting ahead of the story.
