00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:48,981
免费的劳力怎么会嫌少呢?
Can you ever really have enough unpaid help?

138
00:04:49,116 --> 00:04:51,082
一年里志愿者最多的一天?
On the biggest volunteer day of the year?

139
00:04:51,273 --> 00:04:52,683
对, 可以
Yeah,you can.

140
00:04:52,798 --> 00:04:53,978
拜托, 我们只是想帮帮忙
Come on,we just want to help out.

141
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:55,838
Kendall, 他们不错
Kendall,they're cool.

142
00:04:56,845 --> 00:04:58,955
好吧, 但是我不保证任何事
Fine,but I'm not promising anything.

143
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:02,849
在这等着
需要你们的时候会让你们知道
Wait here
We'll let you know if we need you,

144
00:05:02,983 --> 00:05:04,230
好吧, 嗯, 我得到外面去
Okay,well,I'd better get back out there.

145
00:05:04,403 --> 00:05:06,014
有很多食物要分发
There's a lot of food to give out.

146
00:05:06,187 --> 00:05:07,692
还有许多微笑
And a lot of smiles.

147
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,948
噢, 我差点忘了
Oh,I almost forgot.

148
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:19,920
我知道还太早了, 但...
你是未来的Eriksen夫人
I know it's early,but... 
you are a future mrs.Eriksen.

149
00:05:20,064 --> 00:05:21,234
谢谢!
Thank you!

150
00:05:21,378 --> 00:05:23,104
嗯, 我穿起来很合适
Well,it'll go great with me,

151
00:05:23,248 --> 00:05:25,837
呃... 我很喜欢
uh... I just love it.

152
00:05:26,489 --> 00:05:28,992
好了, Lily, 我们要安排你做色拉
Okay,lily,we're putting you on salad duty.

153
00:05:29,098 --> 00:05:31,946
噢, 我会用鲜虾甜辣汁
Oh,l make this great frisee and endive salad

154
00:05:32,071 --> 00:05:34,939
做很棒的蔬菜色拉
with a coriander-lime vinaigrette.

155
00:05:35,073 --> 00:05:37,547
但是今天是美国节日
But this is an American holiday.

156
00:05:38,324 --> 00:05:42,093
Lily, 你就快成为Eriksen夫人了
Lily,now that you're going to be a mrs.Eriksen,

157
00:05:42,237 --> 00:05:45,939
我会让你知道
我们的秘密食谱
I'm going to let you in on a secret recipe:

158
00:05:46,092 --> 00:05:50,331
Eriksen家族七层色拉
The Eriksen family seven-layer salad.

159
00:05:50,494 --> 00:05:53,064
七层色拉?
Seven-layer salad?

160
00:05:54,349 --> 00:05:56,248
六杯蛋黄酱?
"Six cups of mayonnaise"?

161
00:05:56,354 --> 00:05:57,236
不可能吧
That can't be right.

162
00:05:57,342 --> 00:05:59,720
噢, 不是, 亲爱的 是十六杯
Oh,no,dear. 16 cups.

163
00:06:00,104 --> 00:06:01,840
蛋黄酱在那边的橱柜里
Mayo's in that cabinet.

164
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,436
噢, 我的天
Oh,my god.

165
00:06:05,561 --> 00:06:08,361
外面的篮冰球游戏正激烈进行
There is some serious bask-ice-ball going on out there.

166
00:06:08,486 --> 00:06:09,665
爸用雪球打到了Marcus的脸
Dad totally nailed marcus in the face with a snowball,

167
00:06:09,771 --> 00:06:11,037
这太傻了
which is a foul,

168
00:06:11,133 --> 00:06:12,974
因为只能用一次雪球
'cause you only get one snowball per possession,

169
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,317
我用我的冰鞋打到他的胫节
so I nailed him in the shin with

170
00:06:14,451 --> 00:06:16,005
然后就投进了!
my skate and I totally dunked it!

171
00:06:16,436 --> 00:06:17,894
耶, 你一直坐着在看
Yeah,you were sitting pretty,

172
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:19,390
直到我用求棍打到你
till I whacked you with that mallet.

173
00:06:19,515 --> 00:06:20,579
嘿, 好伙计
Hey,gorgeous.

174
00:06:21,145 --> 00:06:22,344
你玩的开心不?
You having fun?

175
00:06:22,727 --> 00:06:24,540
是啊, 但... 但我有点想你
Yeah,but... but I kind of miss you.

176
00:06:24,655 --> 00:06:26,707
你能在这呆会吗?
Could you stay in here for a little bit?

177
00:06:26,832 --> 00:06:29,028
好, 好, 好, 没问题
现在是中场休息
Yeah,yeah,yeah,no problem.
It's halftime.

178
00:06:29,143 --> 00:06:31,742
噢, 休息结束!
把你们的屁股抬起来! 来吧
Oh,halftime's over! 
Get your butts out here!Come on.

179
00:06:31,867 --> 00:06:35,224
我希望你喜欢
冰鞋的味道, 呆子!
And I hope you like the taste of skate,dorko!

180
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,868
-去吧
-谢谢, 宝贝
Go.
Thanks,baby.

181
00:06:40,163 --> 00:06:41,410
啊, 这很棒吧?
Aw,isn't this great?

182
00:06:41,544 --> 00:06:43,328
你能知道为什么
Can't you see why 

183
00:06:43,424 --> 00:06:44,805
我的高中同学都呆在这了吧?
everyone from my high school stays in this town?

184
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:48,574
嘿, Marvin, 你是个呆子, 呆子
Hey,Marvin,you're the dorko,dorko.

185
00:06:53,765 --> 00:06:55,577
天, 外面太让人激动了
Man,it's amazing out there.

186
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,747
我今天做了那么多好事
I've done so much good today,

187
00:06:56,863 --> 00:06:58,915
我就象获得灵魂的升华
I've got like a soul boner.

188
00:06:59,989 --> 00:07:01,926
天, 当你给穷人递上热的有营养的食物
Man,the way the faces of the less fortunate

189
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,806
他们脸上流露出的希望之光
light up when you give them a hot,nutritious meal.

190
00:07:03,931 --> 00:07:05,782
还有什么能比这感觉更好吗?
Is there a better feeling on earth?

191
00:07:05,973 --> 00:07:07,604
昨天你说世界上
最好的感觉是
Yesterday you said the best feeling on earth
was 

192
00:07:07,738 --> 00:07:09,340
吮吸脚趾
getting your toes sucked.

193
00:07:09,474 --> 00:07:13,588
然后你和自己的脚掌击掌
Then you requested a high-five with your foot.

194
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,321
嘿, Barn, 让我们帮帮你吧
Hey,Barn,what do you say you let us sub in for you,

195
00:07:16,446 --> 00:07:18,230
帮你舀食物?
scoop stuffing for a little bit?

196
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,110
你第一天来就想舀食物?
You want to scoop stuffing your first day out?

197
00:07:20,234 --> 00:07:25,404
你好? 国家橄榄球联盟吗?
这周日我能当四分卫吗? 伙计
Hello?NFL?
Can I be quarterback this sunday? Dude.

198
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:30,784
好吧, 我已经把古米熊软糖放上了... 色拉
Okay,I finished the gummi bear layer of the... salad.

199
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:32,184
下一步是什么?
What's next?

200
00:07:32,836 --> 00:07:34,908
薯片 当然
Potato chips.Of course.

201
00:07:35,042 --> 00:07:36,816
那么, Lily...
So,lily... 

202
00:07:36,931 --> 00:07:39,127
你们什么时候考虑生小孩?
when are you gonna start thinking about having a baby?

203
00:07:39,252 --> 00:07:40,010
小孩?
Baby?

204
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:44,316
呃, 你知道, 我还没认真想过这个问题，完全没有
Uh,you know,I hadn't really thought about it.At all.

205
00:07:44,613 --> 00:07:46,167
事实上, Lily阿姨在撒谎
Actually,aunt lily was lying.

206
00:07:46,282 --> 00:07:47,711
她现在脑子里想的都是这个
It was all she'd been thinking about.

207
00:07:47,826 --> 00:07:48,421
你们看
You see,

208
00:07:48,516 --> 00:07:52,007
记得她说... 嗯,我刚才吐了...
remember when she said... well,I just ralphed...

209
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:52,775
那时候
At that point,

210
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,280
她已经晚来了5天
she was five days late.

211
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:55,700
现在是第6天
This was day six.

212
00:07:56,946 --> 00:07:59,852
对, 我说,生小孩
我还太年轻, 是不?
Yeah,I mean,I'm way 
too young to have a baby,right?

213
00:08:00,025 --> 00:08:01,339
噢, 你在开玩笑吗?
Oh,are you kidding?

214
00:08:01,463 --> 00:08:03,247
我怀Marcus比你还小
I was younger than you when I had Marcus.

215
00:08:03,401 --> 00:08:06,297
15磅的可爱小子
Beautiful 15-pound boy.

216
00:08:06,412 --> 00:08:10,315
比这个火鸡大不了多少
Not much bigger than this turkey right here.

217
00:08:12,828 --> 00:08:13,797
噢, 天
Oh,my.

218
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:22,270
现在, Lily开始对加入
now,if lily was already uneasy about joining

219
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:23,747
Eriksen一家犹豫了
the Eriksen family,

220
00:08:23,862 --> 00:08:25,310
想象她对即将有一个15磅的Eriksen
imagine how she felt about possibly having

221
00:08:25,445 --> 00:08:29,185
在她体内生长是什么感受
a 15-pound Eriksen growing inside of her.

222
00:08:29,357 --> 00:08:31,477
真是个大婴儿, Judy
That's a big baby,Judy.

223
00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:33,894
医生以为是双胞胎
The doctor thought he was twins.

224
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:38,622
双胞胎! 双胞胎!

225
00:08:40,367 --> 00:08:41,374
这太疯狂了!
This is crazy!

226
00:08:41,489 --> 00:08:43,532
什么时候做善事变的这么难了?
When did it get so hard to do charity work?

227
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:45,258
我一直在做慈善工作
I do charity work all the time. 

228
00:08:45,364 --> 00:08:47,618
记得我说我要
帮你找女朋友吗?
Remember when I said I'd find you a girlfriend?

229
00:08:47,723 --> 00:08:48,874
令人愉快
Delightful.

230
00:08:49,008 --> 00:08:50,504
这个小工程要什么时候实施?
How's that little project coming along anyway?

231
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:51,521
我一直在努力
I'm working on it.

232
00:08:51,636 --> 00:08:54,110
我将把你介绍给
你正在盯着看的那女孩
I'm gonna introduce you 
to that girl you've been staring at.

233
00:08:54,264 --> 00:08:54,810
什么? 这太疯狂了
What?That's crazy,

234
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,268
我没盯着任何女孩看...
I haven't been staring at any girl...

235
00:08:56,383 --> 00:08:57,793
见过Ted吗?
have you met Ted?

236
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,066
嗨 我就是刚刚提到的Ted

嗯, 如果你想做点什么

243
00:09:11,402 --> 00:09:12,274
你和你的女朋友能帮到
you and your girlfriend can help

244
00:09:12,409 --> 00:09:13,847
把这些捐赠物分类
sort through these donations.

245
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,785
噢, 呃, 我不是他的女朋友

246

以前是, 但, 呃

247
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,335
我在感情和性事上都不适合Ted
I just wasn't enough woman for Ted emotionally or sexually.

248
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:23,994
噢, 我的天
Oh,my god.

249
00:09:24,349 --> 00:09:28,549
那么, Amanda... 你需要我们做什么?
So,Amanda... what do you need us to do?

250
00:09:28,684 --> 00:09:29,691
好吧, 这很重要

查看这些捐赠食物

嘿, 我们有事做了
Hey,we're in business.

256
00:09:38,552 --> 00:09:41,736
嘿, 今天Barney不会独享所有的光环了
Hey,Barney's not gonna get all the glory today.

257
00:09:45,275 --> 00:09:46,244
我们还是从这个开始吧
Let's start with this one.

258
00:09:46,359 --> 00:09:47,174
好啊
Yeah.

259
00:09:48,392 --> 00:09:49,255
阿门

看看谁来说晚安啦

263
00:09:56,477 --> 00:09:57,129
月?
Months?

他在喝牛奶了
He's been drinking his milk.

266
00:10:04,446 --> 00:10:06,470
她又怀孕了吗?
and she's already pregnant again?

267
00:10:06,604 --> 00:10:09,452
嗯, 那是因为Eriksen家孩子
制造的“孩子”会游泳
Well,that's 'cause those 
Eriksen boys can swim.

268
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:13,010
它们有两条尾巴头上有钻
They've got two tails and a drill bit for head.

269
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,446
爸, 你让我难堪了!
Dad,you're embarrassing me!

270
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:17,355
噢, 别担心, 儿子, 她不会介意的
Oh,don't worry about it,son,she's cool.

271
00:10:17,489 --> 00:10:18,909
她就要变成Eriksen的一员了
She's going to be an Eriksen.

272
00:10:19,043 --> 00:10:20,932
是啊 嗯,嗯, 法律上不是
Yeah.Well,well,not literally,

273
00:10:21,057 --> 00:10:23,982
因为, 你知道我要保留我的姓氏
'cause,you know,I'm keeping my name.

274
00:10:24,222 --> 00:10:27,876
但... 那围裙
But... the apron.

275
00:10:29,189 --> 00:10:31,731
嗯, 我们还没决定
什么事情, 我们...
Well,we haven't actually 
decided anything yet,so we're...

276
00:10:31,894 --> 00:10:35,251
不是, 我决定要保留我的姓氏
No,I've decided and I'm keeping my own name.

277
00:10:35,404 --> 00:10:38,857
但Eriksen是个好姓氏
But Eriksen is a great last name.

278
00:10:38,981 --> 00:10:41,110
大家都知道Eriksen一家
People know the Eriksens.

279
00:10:42,463 --> 00:10:44,477
嗯, 确实, 在圣克劳德州
Well,sure,in St. Cloud,

280
00:10:44,601 --> 00:10:51,458
但是我们不会让孩子
在圣克劳德州长大 是不, 宝贝?
but our kids aren't going to be 
growing up in St.Cloud.Right,baby?

281
00:10:51,621 --> 00:10:53,127
嗯, 为什么不在圣克劳德州?
Well,why not St.Cloud?

282
00:10:53,309 --> 00:10:55,275
我是说, 我喜欢在圣克劳德州长大
I mean,I loved growing up in St.Cloud.

283
00:10:55,381 --> 00:10:57,606
圣克劳德州是个度过童年的好地方
St.Cloud is a great place to have a childhood.

284
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,658
嗯, 纽约也是
Well,so is New York.

285
00:11:01,979 --> 00:11:02,852
什么? 就是
what?It is.

286
00:11:02,957 --> 00:11:04,377
我们也成长的很好
And we grew up just fine.

287
00:11:04,473 --> 00:11:09,076
我们长大合适大小然后就停止
And we grew to the proper size and then we stopped.

288
00:11:13,775 --> 00:11:15,243
嘿, Amanda, 这盒东西是要来干嘛的?
Hey,Amanda,what's this box for?

289
00:11:15,386 --> 00:11:16,163
噢, 是给我的
Oh,that's for me.

290
00:11:16,298 --> 00:11:17,487
你可以放到我车上去
You can put it in my car.

291
00:11:18,014 --> 00:11:20,930
你车上, 呃, 然后你就带回...家?
In your car,um,and then you'll take it...Home?

292
00:11:21,074 --> 00:11:22,541
对啊, 我们有很多
多余的食物
Yeah,we get so much extra food,

293
00:11:22,685 --> 00:11:23,999
没人能吃完
no one can eat it all.

294
00:11:24,382 --> 00:11:28,094
噢, 松鹿油 太棒了!
Ooh,truffle oil.Score!

295
00:11:29,062 --> 00:11:30,242
人们捐赠食物是因为
People donated this food 

296
00:11:30,367 --> 00:11:31,594
他们认为这会
拿去给挨饿的人
thinking it was going to feed the hungry.

297
00:11:31,767 --> 00:11:32,553
我知道
I know.

298
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:35,498
我也很饿
And I'm starving.

299
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,506
但, Marshall, 你喜欢纽约
But,Marshall,you love New York.

300
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:42,863
是, 我喜欢, 但是你一直说我们有孩子后
Yes,l do,but you always said that when we have kids,

301
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,647
想搬出曼哈顿
you wanted to move out of Manhattan.

302
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,440
是啊, 去布鲁克林
Yeah,to Brooklyn.

303
00:11:47,294 --> 00:11:48,694
为什么我们要讨论这个?
Why are we even talking about this?

304
00:11:48,857 --> 00:11:50,708
这就象一路走到黑
This is like way down the road.

305
00:11:51,466 --> 00:11:52,923
但Lily知道一路走到黑
But lily knew"way down the road"

306
00:11:53,105 --> 00:11:55,762
也许并不那么远
might not be so far down the road.

307
00:11:56,414 --> 00:11:58,371
我要去厕所
I need to go to the restroom.

308
00:11:58,505 --> 00:12:00,164
Lily, 厕所在另一边
Lily,the restroom's the other way.

309
00:12:00,404 --> 00:12:02,696
所以她走向那条路
So she literally headed down the road.

310
00:12:02,821 --> 00:12:06,781
Lily? Lily!
lily?lily!

311
00:12:08,878 --> 00:12:11,707
这么说你们今天没为
任何人做点什么
So, wait. Not only have you not done
any good for anyone today,

312
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:13,107
还帮别人从流浪者
you're actually helping someone

313
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,373
那里偷取食物?
steal from the homeless?

314
00:12:14,556 --> 00:12:16,244
你知道, Ted, 今天是感恩节
You know,Ted,it's called thanksgiving,

315
00:12:16,407 --> 00:12:18,651
不是感谢偷取东西的节,该死
not thankstaking,damn.

316
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,825
Barney, 你需要我给你
签报到簿, 是吧?
Barney,you needed me to sign your time sheet,right?

317
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,945
噢, 是啊, 对 谢谢
Oh,yeah,right.Thanks.

318
00:12:24,213 --> 00:12:24,837
Barney
Barney.

319
00:12:25,095 --> 00:12:26,285
嗯, 怎么了?
Yeah,what's up?

320
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:27,742
你要签报到簿吗?
You have a time sheet?

321
00:12:27,896 --> 00:12:29,449
别人都没有报到簿
No one else has a time sheet.

322
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,466
对 那?
Yeah. So?

323
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,176
好吧, 让我看看
All right,let me see that.

324
00:12:31,214 --> 00:12:33,458
拜托 这是我的隐私, 我的私事!
That's my private,personal business!

325
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:36,220
法庭服社会役令?
Court-mandated community service?

326
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,206
我的天, 你在缓刑期?
Oh my god,you're on probation?

327
00:12:38,369 --> 00:12:39,462
你干了什么?
What did you do?

328
00:12:40,162 --> 00:12:42,982
这是我的私人问题
That's my private,personal business.

329
00:12:48,793 --> 00:12:50,270
我被不公证的惩罚了
I was unfairly punished

330
00:12:50,405 --> 00:12:53,493
只是因为那面墙属于基督教堂
because the wall belonged to the judge's church.

331
00:12:53,876 --> 00:12:55,430
你在教堂边撒尿?
You peed on a church?

332
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:56,744
是在小巷子里
I peed in an alley,

333
00:12:56,868 --> 00:12:58,038
刚好有座教堂
which happened to have a church,

334
00:12:58,182 --> 00:13:01,146
因为我喝醉了没有看到
which I did not see because I was drunk.

335
00:13:01,616 --> 00:13:03,486
噢, 你是魔鬼
Oh,you are evil.

336
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,085
啊, 世界又正常了
Ah,all's right with the world again.

337
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,617
好吧, 好, 所以法官让我做这个
Okay,fine,so a judge is making me do this.

338
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,237
但我还是在做
But I'm still doing it.

339
00:13:10,468 --> 00:13:13,930
而且做的很棒, 顺便说一句
And kicking ass at it,btw.

340
00:13:14,313 --> 00:13:18,399
最后一次你们做好事是什么时候, 哈?
When's the last time either of you did something good,huh?

341
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:20,825
Kendall
Kendall.

342
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:22,014
啊, Kendall
Ah,Kendall.

343
00:13:22,446 --> 00:13:24,076
Amanda从无家可归的
Amanda is stealing portabello

344
00:13:24,201 --> 00:13:26,599
人们那里偷蘑菇
mushrooms from homeless people.

345
00:13:27,663 --> 00:13:28,622
Amanda
Amanda.

346
00:13:29,294 --> 00:13:31,950
我也想要那些蘑菇
I called dibs on the portabello mushrooms.

347
00:13:32,669 --> 00:13:33,849
这些是给饥饿的人的
Those are for the hungry.

348
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,947
我知道 我很饿
I know. And I'm starving.

349
00:13:42,068 --> 00:13:43,267
那些是很好的蘑菇
Those are good mushrooms.

350
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:45,147
蘑菇 蘑菇
Mushrooms.Mushrooms.

351
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,671
每个人都有蘑菇拿
Portabello mushrooms for everyone.

352
00:13:46,873 --> 00:13:48,436
拿好它们然后跑掉!
Take them and run!

353
00:13:48,714 --> 00:13:50,412
这些是很贵的
They're very expensive.

354
00:13:54,488 --> 00:13:55,878
感恩节快乐
Happy thanksgiving.

355
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,777
感恩节快乐 哼
"Happy thanksgiving." Huh.

356
00:13:57,911 --> 00:14:00,261
如果在这时候买验孕棒算快乐的话, 每个人都快乐
As in "check out the chick buying the knock-up test,everybody.

357
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:02,131
担心着会有什么结果?
Wonder what must be going through her head?

358
00:14:02,544 --> 00:14:03,646
对, 嗯, 既然你问了
Yeah,well,since you asked,

359
00:14:03,848 --> 00:14:06,869
一个喜欢蛋黄酱的巨人家庭
a family of mayonnaise-guzzling giants is trying to

360
00:14:07,003 --> 00:14:09,065
要把我卷进乡村噩梦
suck me into their suburban nightmare,

361
00:14:09,228 --> 00:14:10,926
而且很有可能我怀上了
and there's a solid chance that

362
00:14:11,098 --> 00:14:12,872
15磅的Eriksen家型号的火鸡
I have an Eriksen the size of a 15-pound

363
00:14:13,045 --> 00:14:16,056
正在我身体里滋长!
turkey growing inside of me!

364
00:14:17,173 --> 00:14:18,621
噢, 你知道Eriksen一家?
Oh,you know the Eriksens?

365
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,472
你是Marshall的未婚妻
You're Marshall's fiancee.

366
00:14:21,624 --> 00:14:22,382
太棒了
Fantastic.

367
00:14:22,573 --> 00:14:23,964
很高兴见到你
So nice to meet you.

368
00:14:24,118 --> 00:14:26,199
你比形容的要高
You are taller than described.

369
00:14:27,551 --> 00:14:30,179
我很抱歉刚刚朝你大吼大叫
Look,I'm sorry I just yelled at you.

370
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,905
介意我用下你的卫生间吗?
You mind if I use your bathroom?

371
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:33,085
没有
Don't have one.

372
00:14:33,343 --> 00:14:34,696
你要怎么办当你想...?
What do you do when you have to...?

373
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,674
憋着
I hold it.

374
00:14:42,598 --> 00:14:44,871
你不能解雇一个志愿者
you can't fire a volunteer.

375
00:14:45,015 --> 00:14:46,185
很显然可以

378
00:14:51,047 --> 00:14:52,534
Kendall你们两个很不错
Kendall you guys were cool.

379
00:14:52,697 --> 00:14:54,135
我只有40个小时
I have 40 hours left on

380
00:14:54,289 --> 00:14:55,305
就可以完成我的服务役了
my community service 

381
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:56,907
但现在我
and now I've gotta spend it 

382
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,544
得在该死的林区拣垃圾
spearing trash on a freakin' median strip.

383
00:15:00,638 --> 00:15:04,455
年度最佳志愿者!!

我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

386
00:15:06,382 --> 00:15:07,533
听着, 如果有什么我能弥补的
Look,if there's anything I can do to make it up to you 

387
00:15:07,696 --> 00:15:09,039
就告诉我
just tell me.

388
00:15:09,221 --> 00:15:10,017
我会-我会做的
I'll-I'll do it.

389
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:10,938
Ted, 我很高兴你问了
Ted,I'm glad you asked.

390
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,444
Domo arrigato,mr. Roboto
Domo arrigato,mr. Roboto

391
00:15:12,635 --> 00:15:14,630
domo... domo domo arrigato,mr.Roboto
domo... domo domo arrigato,mr.Roboto 

392
00:15:20,193 --> 00:15:21,132
出乎意料的好
surprisingly good.

393
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,724
是吧? 我就说
Right?I told you so.

394
00:15:22,926 --> 00:15:24,144
公共场所小便
Public urination.

395
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:27,059
谁会因为在公共场所小便被捕?
Who gets arrested for public urination?

396
00:15:27,184 --> 00:15:28,344
Lily被捕了
Lily's been arrested.

397
00:15:28,507 --> 00:15:30,023
噢, 亲爱的 因为什么?
Oh,dear.What for?.

398
00:15:31,644 --> 00:15:33,475
公共场所小便
Public urination.

399
00:15:42,795 --> 00:15:43,419
谢谢你, Pete
Thanks,pete.

400
00:15:43,591 --> 00:15:44,867
没问题, Marsh.
No problemo,Marsh.

401
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:47,677
你还好吧?
You all right?

402
00:15:48,128 --> 00:15:49,029
不好
No.

403
00:15:49,317 --> 00:15:52,031
我在你家人面前丢脸了
I embarrassed myself in front of your family,

404
00:15:52,232 --> 00:15:53,671
然后现在又在最让人压抑的地方
and now I'm celebrating thanksgiving in

405
00:15:53,815 --> 00:15:56,068
庆祝感恩节
probably the most depressing place ever.

406
00:15:57,574 --> 00:15:58,639
Domarrigato,mr.Roboto
Domarrigato,mr.Roboto 

407
00:16:00,538 --> 00:16:02,484
嗯, 我很高兴你很安全
well,I'm glad that you're safe.

408
00:16:02,657 --> 00:16:03,213
嘿, 问个奇怪的问题
Hey,weird question.

409
00:16:03,357 --> 00:16:05,582
为什么你要沿着23号线开3英里
Why did you drive three miles down route 23 and

410
00:16:05,697 --> 00:16:07,730
去一家便利店后面小便?
take a pee behind a convenience store?

411
00:16:07,903 --> 00:16:08,651
好吧, 我会告诉你
Okay,I'll tell you,

412
00:16:08,785 --> 00:16:09,601
但在这之前
but before I do,

413
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:11,039
答应我我们不会搬来
promise me that we are not gonna move to 

414
00:16:11,193 --> 00:16:13,341
明尼苏达圣可劳德州
答应我！！
St.Cloud,Minnesota.
Promise.

415
00:16:13,456 --> 00:16:15,144
我并没有说希望我们明天立马就搬来啊
I'm not suggesting that we move here tomorrow,

416
00:16:15,268 --> 00:16:16,458
我只是...
答应就好了
I'm just... 
promise.

417
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,050
为什么你希望我答应你这个?
Why do you want me to promise you that?

418
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:19,584
因为 我不适合这里
Because.I don't fit in here.

419
00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:20,812
我没有8英尺高
I'm not eight feet tall,

420
00:16:20,936 --> 00:16:22,010
我也不认为里面加了
and I don't think you could call it

421
00:16:22,126 --> 00:16:24,753
油炸洋葱卷的沙拉算不上沙拉
a salad if it has funyuns in it.

422
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:25,875
我就是油炸洋葱卷
I'm funyuns.

423
00:16:26,758 --> 00:16:27,966
还有蛋黄酱,还有古米熊软糖
And mayonnaise and gummi bears 

424
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,338
和篮冰球
and bask-ice-ball,

425
00:16:29,453 --> 00:16:30,968
我喜欢圣克劳德州
and I love St.Cloud.

426
00:16:31,112 --> 00:16:32,675
还有, 是的
And,yes,

427
00:16:32,809 --> 00:16:33,768
可能有一天我会想搬回来
there is a part of me that would like to move here someday,

428
00:16:33,931 --> 00:16:35,226
但是为什么我们要在
and why are we having this discussion

429
00:16:35,389 --> 00:16:38,036
感恩节的监狱里
讨论这个呢?
in a jail cell on thanksgiving?

430
00:16:38,592 --> 00:16:41,719
好了, 你的私人物品,一个钱包
Okay,personal effects. One wallet.

431
00:16:41,853 --> 00:16:46,437
一个手机 一个... 验孕棒
One cell phone. One... pregnancy test.

432
00:16:52,585 --> 00:16:56,641
Pete在我看这个之前就逮捕了我
Pete arrested me before I could look at it.

433
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:03,978
哇
Whoa.

434
00:17:04,534 --> 00:17:05,618
耶
Yeah.

435
00:17:06,491 --> 00:17:09,243
Lily, 我们不能让我们的孩子玩篮冰球
Lily,we can't let our kids play bask-ice-ball.

436
00:17:09,397 --> 00:17:12,936
篮冰球真的很危险
Bask-ice-ball is really dangerous.

437
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:14,748
是啊, 那游戏的规则到底是什么?
Yeah,what are the rules to that game,anyway?

438
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,736
没有规则
There are no rules.

439
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:18,181
我们互相乱叫
We just wail on each other.

440
00:17:22,219 --> 00:17:26,525
听着, 我并不想和我的家族一个模子
Look,I don't want to be exactly like my family.

441
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:28,664
也不要误会我
And don't take this the wrong way,

442
00:17:29,527 --> 00:17:30,716
但我也不想
but I don't want to be exactly

443
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,634
和你的家庭一个模子
like your family either.

444
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,087
我们应该有我们自己的家庭
We'll be our own family.

445
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:38,945
我们会找到
And we'll find our own way to

446
00:17:39,098 --> 00:17:41,879
我们自己的方式抚养小孩
freak out the people our kids bring home

447
00:17:44,315 --> 00:17:47,998
太好了, 我都哭了 听着
Great,now I'm crying. Look.

448
00:17:48,228 --> 00:17:49,743
我们在十秒内可能会有
We may have some really big decisions

449
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:52,160
一个重大的决定需要我们去做
to make in about ten seconds.

450
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:53,560
但是现在, 我不在乎
But right now,I don't care

451
00:17:53,723 --> 00:17:54,807
我们的孩子在哪长大
where our kids grow up.

452
00:17:55,047 --> 00:17:57,905
只要你是父亲
As long as they have you for a father.

453
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:02,671
天, 我希望你是父亲
Gosh,I hope you're the father.

454
00:18:02,911 --> 00:18:06,555
只是个缓和气氛的小玩笑
Just a little joke to lighten up the mood.

455
00:18:11,063 --> 00:18:12,243
看看结果?
What does it say?

456
00:18:13,374 --> 00:18:14,400
我害怕看
I'm afraid to look.

457
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,798
是阴性的!
It's negative!

458
00:18:17,469 --> 00:18:19,464
噢, 感谢上帝
Thank god. Oh,thank god.

459
00:18:20,663 --> 00:18:21,612
还有, 嘿!

你是个不错的家伙

463
00:18:30,074 --> 00:18:31,867
想知道为什么我明天得工作吗?
Want to know why I have to work tomorrow?

464

Walter想要一个大腿舞
And Walter would like a lap dance.

472
00:18:46,704 --> 00:18:47,682
你在开玩笑吗?

我从来不拿严肃的

讥讽艺术开玩笑

00:18:52,391 --> 00:18:54,232
不, Barney, 这太不正常了

十一月的感恩节
Thanksgiving in November.

496
00:19:40,774 --> 00:19:41,877

那就是2005年的感恩节

说实话，过的并不开心
