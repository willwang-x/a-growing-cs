老爸老妈罗曼史
第一季 第二十一集
How.I.Met.Your.Mother
Season 01 Episode 21

4
00:00:13,677 --> 00:00:15,787
孩子们，人生就像一条黑暗的道路
Kids,life is a dark road.

5
00:00:15,787 --> 00:00:17,609
你永远看不清前方等待你的将是什么
You never really know what's up ahead.

6
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:20,295
一个夜晚，当你独自享受的行驶在这条道路上时
One night you're cruising along enjoying the ride,

7
00:00:20,295 --> 00:00:21,925
突然间
and then all of a sudden,

8
00:00:22,788 --> 00:00:24,323
你28岁了
you're 28.

9
00:00:24,323 --> 00:00:26,145
这是给生日男孩的千层面
For the birthday boy,lasagna.

10
00:00:26,145 --> 00:00:27,008
谢谢
Thank you.

11
00:00:27,008 --> 00:00:29,022
小心，盘子很烫
Careful.The plate is very hot.

12
00:00:29,022 --> 00:00:30,173
好的
OKay.

13
00:00:31,516 --> 00:00:33,050
哦，来吧，碰一下
Oh,go on,touch it.

14
00:00:34,009 --> 00:00:34,776
见鬼
Sweet damn,

15
00:00:34,776 --> 00:00:36,503
好烫的盘子
that's a hot plate.

16
00:00:37,174 --> 00:00:38,229
好吧,那么,Barney,
All right,so,Barney,

17
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:39,380
你干不干啊?
are you doing this or what?

18
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,722
老天,Barney,别
jeez,Barney,don't do this.

19
00:00:40,722 --> 00:00:42,640
我必须做，这是我给Ted的生日礼物
I have to,it's my birthday present to Ted.

20
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,599
你不是一定要做
You don't have to.

21
00:00:43,599 --> 00:00:45,038
拜托，会很丢人的
Please,it's going to be embarrassing

22
00:00:45,038 --> 00:00:46,285
我们以后都不敢再来了
and we're going to have to stop coming here,

23
00:00:46,285 --> 00:00:47,532
这可不怎么好...
which will suck...

24
00:00:47,532 --> 00:00:50,121
补充一点，不来这可能会更健康
in addition to probably being kind of healthy.

25
00:00:50,313 --> 00:00:51,559
拜托,Marshall,
Come on,Marshall,

26
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:54,341
这在什么时候都是泡妞的好招
it's the greatest pickup line of all time.

27
00:00:54,341 --> 00:00:55,492
Barney
Barney.

28
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:57,026
天啊
gevalt.

29
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,862
生日快乐,Ted
happy birthday,Ted.

30
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:05,561
请原谅,有人告诉过你...
excuse me,has anyone ever told Y...

31
00:01:05,561 --> 00:01:06,808
哦，天啊
oh,my god.

32
00:01:06,808 --> 00:01:07,575
怎么?
What?

33
00:01:08,247 --> 00:01:09,781
叫救护车!
Call an ambulance!

34
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:10,357
怎么回事?
What's going on?

35
00:01:10,357 --> 00:01:11,220
别说话
Try not to speak.

36
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:11,987
来，坐下
Here,sit down.

37
00:01:11,987 --> 00:01:12,562
只要别说话
Just don't talk,

38
00:01:12,562 --> 00:01:13,521
别说话
don't talk.

39
00:01:13,521 --> 00:01:14,193
她没事吧?
Is she okay?

40
00:01:14,193 --> 00:01:15,919
我认真的,拨911
I'm serious,call 911.

41
00:01:15,919 --> 00:01:16,399
怎么了?
What's wrong?

42
00:01:16,399 --> 00:01:17,933
怎么回事?
What's the matter?

43
00:01:17,933 --> 00:01:18,604
不要动
Just don't move.

44
00:01:18,604 --> 00:01:19,084
不要动
Don't move.

45
00:01:19,084 --> 00:01:19,659
只要试着...
Just try...

46
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:20,714
来，喝点水
here,have some water.

47
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:21,961
水!
Water!

48
00:01:22,632 --> 00:01:23,879
来，喝了这个
Here,drink this.

49
00:01:25,989 --> 00:01:27,236
你知道吗，我看得越多
You know,the more I watch this,

50
00:01:27,236 --> 00:01:30,880
就越觉得这个任何时候都合适的泡妞妙招没什么说服力
the less convinced I am that it's the
greatest pickup line of all time.

51
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,319
等等
Wait for it.

52
00:01:32,702 --> 00:01:33,757
28
28.

53
00:01:33,757 --> 00:01:36,634
还有两年就是重要的三十岁
Two more 'til the big one,three-O.

54
00:01:36,634 --> 00:01:39,607
事实上，我的30岁生日也不太糟糕
Actually,my 30th birthday wasn't so bad.

55
00:01:39,607 --> 00:01:41,238
除了我的洗手间多了只羊
except for the goat in my bathroom.

56
00:01:41,238 --> 00:01:42,772
倒是个好故事
Which is a great story.

57
00:01:42,772 --> 00:01:44,498
但我以后再讲
But I'll get to that later.

58
00:01:44,498 --> 00:01:45,649
而且，你知道
Still,you know,

59
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:47,088
又老了一岁
another year older.

60
00:01:47,088 --> 00:01:48,335
却还是单身
Still single.

61
00:01:48,335 --> 00:01:50,924
你难道没有听到自己“Ted钟”在向前走吗?
You don't hear your Tedological clock ticking?

62
00:01:50,924 --> 00:01:51,595
没有
Nope.

63
00:01:51,595 --> 00:01:53,418
我按下睡眠键了
I hit the snooze button.

64
00:01:53,897 --> 00:01:55,815
护理员来了
And here come the paramedics.

65
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:57,541
哦，谢天谢地，你们来了
Oh,thank god,you're here.

66
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:58,405
什么情况?!
What is going on?!

67
00:01:58,405 --> 00:02:00,035
我想可能是内出血
I think there might be some internal bleeding.

68
00:02:00,035 --> 00:02:01,569
可能有破裂
Probably some fractures.

69
00:02:01,569 --> 00:02:02,433
我们必须送她去医院
We got to get her to the hospital.

70
00:02:02,433 --> 00:02:03,487
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

71
00:02:03,487 --> 00:02:04,830
你摔的很重
You've had a terrible fall.

72
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,789
我没有摔啊
No,I haven't.

73
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:06,269
真的吗?
Really?

74
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:08,858
我发誓你是从天堂摔落下的
Cause I could swear you fell straight out of heaven.

75
00:02:08,858 --> 00:02:09,913
天使...
Angel...

76
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:14,516
给他你的号码 
Give him your number.

77
00:02:14,516 --> 00:02:15,188
什么?
What?

78
00:02:15,188 --> 00:02:17,010
给他你的号码 
Give him your number.

79
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:17,489
什么?
What?

80
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:19,120
给他你的号码 
Give him your number.

81
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,079
你在让我难堪
you're embarrassing me.

82
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,805
给他你的号码 
Give him your number.

83
00:02:21,805 --> 00:02:22,476
你怎么...?
What are you...?

84
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:23,819
-来吧
-给他你的号码 
-Come on.
-Give him your number.

85
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:24,586
你不给我号码
They're not going to stop

86
00:02:24,586 --> 00:02:26,696
他们是不会停下的
'til you give me your number.

87
00:02:26,696 --> 00:02:27,847
给他你的号码 
Give him your number.

88
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:28,327
好吧!
All right!

89
00:02:28,327 --> 00:02:29,861
成功!
It works!

90
00:02:31,779 --> 00:02:34,944
我不敢相信她给了他号码 
I cannot believe that she gave him her number.

91
00:02:34,944 --> 00:02:37,725
她可能真的脑子受损了
Maybe she really does have a brain injury.

92
00:02:38,397 --> 00:02:39,835
谢谢大家
Thank you,everyone.

93
00:02:39,835 --> 00:02:40,506

It's been fun.

94
00:02:40,506 --> 00:02:41,178
这是服务生Wendy
It's Wendy the waitress.

95
00:02:41,178 --> 00:02:42,233
多给她点小费
Tip her well.

去看他们的表演吧，他们很不错

100
00:02:48,275 --> 00:02:49,809
我知道我为什么还单身了

101
00:02:49,809 --> 00:02:50,672
我太挑剔了
I'm picky.

102
00:02:50,672 --> 00:02:51,535
我不会定下来的
I'm not going to settle.

103
00:02:51,535 --> 00:02:52,590
我要娶的人,
If I'm going to marry someone,

104

105
00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:54,700
嗯，怎么样的完美?
Well,what's perfect?

106
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,235
具体我可不知道
It's not like I have a list.

107
00:02:56,235 --> 00:02:56,714
哦，你知道
Oh,yes,you do.

108
00:02:56,714 --> 00:02:58,440
迷人，大学毕业

一个男孩，一个女孩...

111
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:00,646
这不难

00:03:00,646 --> 00:03:01,605
-我知道，至少...
-我还没说完

-I'm not done.

113
00:03:01,605 --> 00:03:02,564
她喜欢狗

114
00:03:02,564 --> 00:03:03,523
喜欢Otis Redding

00:03:04,866 --> 00:03:05,729
擅长运动
She's into sports,

117
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:06,976
但是不要运动太多
but not so much so that her legs are,like,

118
00:03:06,976 --> 00:03:08,127
腿上肌肉比我还多的那种
more muscular than mine.

119
00:03:08,127 --> 00:03:09,182
我觉得太奇怪，不喜欢
That weirds me out.

120
00:03:09,182 --> 00:03:11,292
而且她要能像Pixies里的Kim Deal
那样弹低音电吉他
And she plays bass guitar like Kim 
Deal from the Pixies.

121
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:13,018
或者像Sonic Youth里的Kim Gordon

122
00:03:13,018 --> 00:03:14,936
或者像任何一个酷乐队里的Kim

123
00:03:14,936 --> 00:03:15,991
不要太挑剔
Can't be too picky.

124
00:03:15,991 --> 00:03:17,909
你永远找不到这样的女孩的
You're never going to find this girl.

125
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:18,388
完全正确
Exactly.

126
00:03:18,388 --> 00:03:20,307
所以我只能等她来找我
So I'm just going to wait for her to come to me.

127
00:03:20,307 --> 00:03:22,704
我不想再计划无法计划的事情了
I am done trying to plan the unplannable.

128
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:25,869
那么，你是认为命运会帮你搞定?
So,what,you think fate's just gonna take care of it?

129
00:03:25,869 --> 00:03:27,212
这就是我的计划
That's the plan.

130
00:03:29,322 --> 00:03:30,185
然而我不知道
And little did I know,

131
00:03:30,185 --> 00:03:31,240
就在那一刻
at that very moment,

132
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,911
命运--
fate--

133
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:35,843
借助一台60万兆赫的超处理电脑
in the form of a 600 gigahertz superprocessing computer

134
00:03:35,843 --> 00:03:37,761
帮我搞定了
was taking care of it.

135
00:03:43,036 --> 00:03:44,091
你起早了
you're up early.

136
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:46,105
我还以为我要用烤薄饼这招呢
thought I'd whip up some pancakes.

137
00:03:46,105 --> 00:03:46,872
Marshall知道吗?
Does Marshall know?

138
00:03:46,872 --> 00:03:48,694
他听起来好像还在睡
He's still sound asleep.

139
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:56,175
太棒了
Awesome.

140
00:03:56,558 --> 00:03:58,285
真太棒了
So awesome.

141
00:03:58,285 --> 00:04:00,490
天! 你是最棒的女孩
God! Best girl ever.

142
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,641
干掉这些薄饼
Screw these pancakes,

143
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:04,135
我要用糖浆把你裹起来然后吞掉
I should cover you in syrup and gobble you up.

144
00:04:04,135 --> 00:04:05,573
求你别那么做
Please don't do that.

145
00:04:07,108 --> 00:04:08,642
嘿，牛奶没坏吧?
Hey,is this milk any good?

146
00:04:12,382 --> 00:04:14,109
我昨天喝了，也这样
that totally got me yesterday.

147
00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:16,123
天，那你为什么不扔掉?
God,why didn't you throw it away?

148
00:04:17,178 --> 00:04:18,328
下班以后我要去买东西
I'm going shopping after work.

149
00:04:18,328 --> 00:04:20,055
会带牛奶回来

150
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:24,179
这些薄饼真让人高兴

151
00:04:26,672 --> 00:04:28,015
怎么回事，宝贝?
What's wrong,baby?

152
00:04:29,549 --> 00:04:31,659
这是我一天中最快乐的时候
This is the high point of my day.

153
00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:32,522
确实如此
It was true.

154
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,728
瞧,Marshall一直梦想能用自己的律师学位

156
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:37,701
但是他结婚需要钱
But he needed money for the wedding,

157
00:04:37,701 --> 00:04:40,291
所以他在Barney的公司实习两个月了...
so he'd been interning for two months
 at Barney's firm...

158
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,496
他恨在那的每一分钟
and he hated every minute of it.

159
00:04:42,496 --> 00:04:42,976
嘿,Barney,
Hey,Barney,

160
00:04:42,976 --> 00:04:45,757
我填这些请购单时有点问题
I had some questions about filling
out these requisition forms.

161
00:04:45,757 --> 00:04:46,428
拿望远镜

162
00:04:46,428 --> 00:04:48,155
我桌上那副
Second pair on my desk.

163
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:49,785
我没时间玩匍匐的游戏,伙计
I don't have time to be creepy,dude.

164
00:04:49,785 --> 00:04:51,032
我有很多事做
I have a lot of work to do.

165
00:04:51,032 --> 00:04:52,758
就看一下，好吗?

173
00:05:05,034 --> 00:05:07,431
他都要在楼下的熟食店定一个三明治
he orders a sandwich from the deli downstairs.

174
00:05:07,431 --> 00:05:08,294
然后?
So?

175
00:05:08,966 --> 00:05:11,555
猜猜我对他的三明治做了什么?
So guess what I did to that sandwich?

176

瞧，我拍了照

为什么这么做?
Why would you do that?

182
00:05:40,231 --> 00:05:40,710
谁知道?
Who knows?

183
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,149
这场交锋已经持续很久了
This feud goes so far back

184
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:43,683
我都记不得谁先开的火了
I can't remember who fired the first shot.

185
00:05:43,683 --> 00:05:44,450
你?
You?

拜托，伙计,

00:06:04,207 --> 00:06:06,796
我不是招你来这发挥你的律师技能的
I didn't recruit you to work
here for your lawyering skills.

200
00:06:06,796 --> 00:06:10,920

mischief consultant.

201
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,646

现在对不起
Now I'm sorry,

205
00:06:15,235 --> 00:06:17,249

00:06:20,222 --> 00:06:22,141
Tracy,请你进来一下好吗?

请你通知Eriksen先生

事实上，这就是我打来的原因

221

225
00:07:04,314 --> 00:07:06,328
她不是这的老板吗?

我的公司买下了这里

235
00:07:24,741 --> 00:07:25,221

你想见我

所以我猜这代表我们又讲话了?

259
00:08:01,952 --> 00:08:03,391
你能帮我尝尝这杯拿铁吗?

但是我收到了Butterfield的邮件

我们应该先刷刷牙吧?

275
00:08:38,396 --> 00:08:39,642
好像是个好主意

你不能叫Marshall去吗?

290
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,797
Marshall不能知道这件事
Marshall can't know about this.

291
00:09:08,797 --> 00:09:10,428
瞧,Ted,天黑了
Look,Ted,it's dark,

292
00:09:10,428 --> 00:09:11,962
我不会换轮胎
I don't know how to change a tire,

293
00:09:11,962 --> 00:09:16,182
而且我开始想一个很恐怖的野营故事了
and I've stumbled into the beginning
of a very scary campfire story.

294
00:09:16,182 --> 00:09:17,428
求你了
Can you please hurry?

295
00:09:17,428 --> 00:09:18,483
我不行，我在等...
I can't,I'm waiting...

296
00:09:18,483 --> 00:09:21,840
哦，我的天,那是一个带有一只铁钩手的流浪汉吗?
oh,my god,is that a drifter with a
hook for a hand?

297
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,566
不，流浪汉，别!
No,drifter,no!

298
00:09:23,566 --> 00:09:25,101
拜托,Lily
Come on,Lily.

299
00:09:25,101 --> 00:09:26,635
你明白我意思了
But you see my point.

300
00:09:27,882 --> 00:09:29,416
好吧，呆在那
all right,stay there.

301
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:30,471
我来了
I'm on my way.

302
00:09:33,849 --> 00:09:34,520
于是
And so,

303
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,013
付了90美元出租车费后
one $90 cab ride later,

304
00:09:37,013 --> 00:09:39,219
我到了个不知名的地方
I was in the middle of nowhere.

305
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,096
谢天谢地
thank god.

306
00:09:42,096 --> 00:09:43,631
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry about this.

307
00:09:43,631 --> 00:09:44,782
你的约会推迟了吗?
Did you get a hold of your date?

308
00:09:44,782 --> 00:09:45,357
对
Yes.

309
00:09:45,357 --> 00:09:47,563
她对推迟一下没有意见吧?
And was she okay about pushing it back?

310
00:09:47,563 --> 00:09:48,810
没有，因为她是完美的
Yes.Because she's perfect.

311
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,344
那么我为什么要来?
So what am I doing here?

312
00:09:50,344 --> 00:09:51,879
你永远别告诉Marshall
You can never tell Marshall.

313
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:52,358
我不会的
I won't.

314
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:52,934
永远
Ever.

315
00:09:52,934 --> 00:09:53,509
发誓
Swear.

316
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:56,194
用你没出生的儿子和女儿的生命发誓
Swear on the lives of your unborn boy and girl.

317
00:09:56,194 --> 00:09:58,400
我用Luke和Leia发誓
I swear on Luke and Leia.

318
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:00,989
大概一个月前
About a month ago,

319
00:10:00,989 --> 00:10:03,195
我开始失眠
I started getting insomnia.

320
00:10:03,675 --> 00:10:07,223
我一直都很想嫁给Marshall
Marrying Marshall had been
all I wanted for a long time.

321
00:10:07,223 --> 00:10:08,566
但是，现在真的要发生了
But,now that it was really happening,

322
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,963
却好像太重大太可怕
it seemed kind of huge and scary.

323
00:10:10,963 --> 00:10:12,690
你和Marshall谈过这事吗?
Did you talk to Marshall about it?

324
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:13,745
他不会懂的
He wouldn't have understood.

325
00:10:13,745 --> 00:10:17,005
他对结婚不怎么紧张
He's not exactly nervous about tying the knot.

326
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,664
所以我晚上就读书
so I spent my nights reading,

327
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:23,815
画画
painting,

328
00:10:23,815 --> 00:10:26,020
玩游戏，还得了最高分...
setting the high score on Super Bomberman...

329
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:26,884
是你?
That was you?

330
00:10:26,884 --> 00:10:27,459
太棒了!
Awesome!

331
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:28,034
我知道!
I know!

332
00:10:28,034 --> 00:10:29,952
我刚进入地带，...
I just got in the zone and...

333
00:10:29,952 --> 00:10:31,871
这不是重点
not the point of the story.

334
00:10:31,871 --> 00:10:33,885
然后我想到了Victoria
And then I started thinking about Victoria

335
00:10:33,885 --> 00:10:36,282
她为了自己的梦想去了德国
and how she followed her dream to Germany,

336
00:10:36,282 --> 00:10:38,296
然后我看到了这个艺术奖学金
then I found this art fellowship,

337
00:10:38,296 --> 00:10:38,776
我猜猜
Let me guess.

338
00:10:38,776 --> 00:10:40,981
在很远的地方
It's somewhere far away.

339
00:10:40,981 --> 00:10:42,516
旧金山
San Francisco.

340
00:10:43,187 --> 00:10:45,681
但是我不是要去做
But it's not like I'm going to do it.

341
00:10:45,681 --> 00:10:47,887
日期和婚礼有冲突
The dates conflict with the wedding.

342
00:10:47,887 --> 00:10:50,188
但我喜欢画画
But I love painting,

343
00:10:50,188 --> 00:10:53,257
一直想知道自己画的好不好
and I've always wondered if I'm any good.

344
00:10:54,024 --> 00:10:55,847
用这个方法可以找出答案
This was a way to find out.

345
00:10:55,847 --> 00:10:57,477
面试是今晚
And the interview is tonight.

346
00:10:57,477 --> 00:10:59,011
在New Haven
In New Haven.

347
00:11:04,094 --> 00:11:05,916
你不想结婚
You don't want to get married.

348
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,218
我当然想结婚
Of course I want to get married.

349
00:11:08,218 --> 00:11:09,177
我...
I...

350
00:11:09,177 --> 00:11:11,671
不是说我一定会去
it's not like I was ever gonna do it.

351
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,822
我只是...
I just...

352
00:11:12,822 --> 00:11:16,082
我只是想知道我能不能得到这个机会
I just really wanted to see if I could get this.

353
00:11:16,082 --> 00:11:19,823
Lily,我们住在美国文化和艺术的中心
Lily,we live in the center of art and
 culture in America.

354
00:11:19,823 --> 00:11:22,220
我确定你一定能在这找到一样有选择性的项目
I'm sure you could find a program here
that's just as selective.

355
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,522
但是你选择了3,000里以外的
But you chose one in a city 3,000 miles away,

356
00:11:24,522 --> 00:11:26,440
而且你没有告诉Marshall
and you didn't tell Marshall.

357
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,550
我觉得这代表了什么已经很明显了
I think it's pretty clear what that means.

358
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:32,386
好吧，我...
Okay,I was...

359
00:11:32,866 --> 00:11:35,263
我是动摇了
I was having second thoughts.

360
00:11:35,647 --> 00:11:37,853
但我不会再了
But I'm not any more.

361
00:11:37,853 --> 00:11:38,716
我...
I...

362
00:11:38,716 --> 00:11:40,921
我的意思是，轮胎坏了就预示
I mean,this flat tire was a sign.

363
00:11:40,921 --> 00:11:42,744
我不该这么做
I'm not supposed to do this.

364
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,278
我应该回家
I'm supposed to go home

365
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:46,196
和Marshall在一起
and-and be with Marshall.

366
00:11:47,731 --> 00:11:49,361
你一定觉得我很傻
You must think I'm so stupid.

367
00:11:49,361 --> 00:11:50,991
我不觉得你傻
I don't think you're stupid.

368
00:11:51,567 --> 00:11:52,334
我爱Marshall
I love Marshall.

369
00:11:52,334 --> 00:11:53,293
我知道你爱他
I know you do.

370
00:11:53,293 --> 00:11:54,636
过来
Come here.

371
00:11:57,609 --> 00:11:58,951
没事的
It's okay.

372
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:00,006
瞧...
Look...

373
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,541
婚姻是重大的事情
marriage is big.

374
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,267
你可以害怕
You're allowed to freak out.

375
00:12:03,267 --> 00:12:05,473
但是为什么只有我害怕?
But why am I the only one?

376
00:12:05,473 --> 00:12:08,158
为什么Marshall就没做什么疯狂的事?
How come Marshall isn't doing anything crazy?

377
00:12:08,158 --> 00:12:10,172
那么我们只需要一只大纸箱
So all we need is one large shipping box

378
00:12:10,172 --> 00:12:12,090
和100只白老鼠
and 100 white mice.

379
00:12:14,871 --> 00:12:15,926
完成
All done.

380
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:21,009
Ted,我们去New Haven吧
Ted,let's go to New Haven.

381
00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:22,160
Lily,
Lily,

382
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,599
别对你自己做这样的事
don't do this to yourself.

383
00:12:23,599 --> 00:12:25,805
我只是想知道我能不能入围
I just need to know if I can get in.

384
00:12:25,805 --> 00:12:27,243
如果我去面试
If I do this interview,

385
00:12:27,243 --> 00:12:28,010
得到了这个项目
and get into the program,

386
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:28,682
到时我就能
then I'll know,

387
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:30,120
忘记这一切
and I can forget all about it,

388
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,983
去结婚
and get married.

389
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:31,559
来吧!
Come on!

390
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:32,518
这是场冒险
It's an adventure.

391
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,340
不，这不是冒险
No,it's not an adventure.

392
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,299
这是个错误
It's a mistake.

393
00:12:35,299 --> 00:12:37,409
好吧，对，这是个错误
Okay,yes,it's a mistake.

394
00:12:37,409 --> 00:12:38,656
我知道这是个错误
I know it's a mistake.

395
00:12:38,656 --> 00:12:40,670
但生活中有些事情
But there are certain things in life

396
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,725
你知道会是错误
where you know it's a mistake

397
00:12:41,725 --> 00:12:43,259
却又不明确一定是错误
but you don't really know it's a mistake

398
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:46,136
因为明确这是一个错误的唯一方法就是犯下这个错误
because the only way to really know it's
a mistake is to make the mistake,

399
00:12:46,136 --> 00:12:46,903
然后再回头看，就可以说
and look back,and say,

400
00:12:46,903 --> 00:12:48,438
"对，是个错误"
"yep.That was a mistake."

401
00:12:48,438 --> 00:12:51,794
所以，不犯这个错误将是个更大的错误
So,really,the bigger mistake would be to not make the mistake,

402
00:12:51,794 --> 00:12:53,713
因为这样你一辈子都不能肯定
because then you go your whole life
 not really knowing

403
00:12:53,713 --> 00:12:55,247
这是不是错误
if something is a mistake or not.

404
00:12:55,247 --> 00:12:55,918
而且，见鬼
And,damn it,

405
00:12:55,918 --> 00:12:57,357
我从来没犯过错误!
I've made no mistakes!

406
00:12:57,357 --> 00:12:58,795
我什么都完成了--
I've done all of this--

407
00:12:58,795 --> 00:13:01,673
我的生活，爱情，事业--
my life,my relationship,my career--

408
00:13:01,673 --> 00:13:03,495
零错误
mistake-free.

409
00:13:03,878 --> 00:13:06,084
你觉得有道理吗?
Does any of this make sense to you?

410
00:13:06,084 --> 00:13:08,482
我不知道,你说了很多次"错误"
I don't know.,You said "mistake" a lot.

411
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,496
Lily,别这么做
Lily,don't do this.

412
00:13:10,496 --> 00:13:12,797
Ted,我两个月后就要结婚了
Ted,I'm getting married in two months,

413
00:13:12,797 --> 00:13:13,757
我害怕
and I'm freaking out,

414
00:13:13,757 --> 00:13:14,907
而你是我最好的朋友
and you're my best friend,

415
00:13:14,907 --> 00:13:16,825
所以你必须原谅我这么做
and you just have to forgive me for this.

416
00:13:16,825 --> 00:13:17,976
原谅你什么?
Forgive you for what?

417
00:13:17,976 --> 00:13:19,415
Lily
Lily.

418
00:13:19,415 --> 00:13:20,758
Lily!
Lily!

419
00:13:25,265 --> 00:13:25,936
Lily!
Lily!

420
00:13:25,936 --> 00:13:26,799
是Ted
this is Ted

421
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:29,389
被你留在路边的人
the guy you left stranded by the side of the road.

422
00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:31,595
我只是想说祝你在面试中好运
I just wanted to say good luck with the interview,

423
00:13:31,595 --> 00:13:33,225
记住带牛奶回来...
remember to pick up some milk...

424
00:13:33,225 --> 00:13:34,664
而我回去的时候
and,when I get home,

425
00:13:34,664 --> 00:13:36,486
要杀了你
I'm going to kill you.

426
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:39,363
而且我也给了发了短信说了一样的话
And,also,I texted you the same thing.

427
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:48,570
我需要你帮个大忙
I need a big favor.

428
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,625
任何事都可以，兄弟
Anything,bro.

429
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,543
我要你来Duchess郡接我
I need you to come up to Duchess county
 and pick me up.

430
00:13:51,543 --> 00:13:52,694
不
No.

431
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,187
事情紧急
It's kind of an emergency.

432
00:13:55,187 --> 00:13:57,297
你在Duchess郡干吗?
What are you doing in Duchess county?

433
00:13:57,297 --> 00:13:58,352
摘苹果
Apple picking.

434
00:13:58,352 --> 00:13:59,886

他被困在Duchess郡了

那你在Duchess郡干什么?
So what are you doing in Duchess county?

444

难道你兄弟来摘个苹果非得被拷问吗?tmd!
Can't a brother go apple picking without getting the third degree?Damn!

00:14:23,287 --> 00:14:24,438

452

开个玩笑

453
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,794
我不在Duchess郡

454
00:14:27,794 --> 00:14:28,466
那么这是个玩笑?
So that's the prank?

455
00:14:28,466 --> 00:14:30,672
你不在Duchess郡?
That you're not in Duchess county?

456
00:14:30,672 --> 00:14:31,535
对
Yep.

457
00:14:31,535 --> 00:14:32,877
你上当了!
Gotcha!

458
00:14:32,877 --> 00:14:34,220
太经典了!

459

我要挂了
Gotta go.

460

but I can't imagine having this much
 fun over there.

468
00:14:54,743 --> 00:14:57,141
你想来这做全职?
You thinking about coming to work here full-time?

469
00:14:57,141 --> 00:14:58,580

475
00:15:11,623 --> 00:15:12,198
你会这么想?
Were you going to think of that?

476
00:15:12,198 --> 00:15:12,677

糟透了
Horrible.

479
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:19,391
幸运的是，我还可以打给一个人,让她载我回家
Luckily,there was still one person I
could call to get a ride home.

480
00:15:19,391 --> 00:15:20,829
要搭车吗，牛仔?
Need a ride,cowboy?

481
00:15:20,829 --> 00:15:21,309

我不进陌生人的车
I don't get in vans with strangers.

483
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:23,994
太遭了
too bad.

484
00:15:23,994 --> 00:15:25,145
我有糖
I got candy.

485
00:15:25,145 --> 00:15:26,679
糖?!
Candy?!

486
00:15:28,981 --> 00:15:30,612
你不想告诉我你在Duchess郡
So you're not going to tell me what you were doing

487
00:15:30,612 --> 00:15:32,530
的路边做什么?

这让人难堪

494
00:15:39,243 --> 00:15:41,065
我把头发“加亮”了
I got Highlights.

495
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,079
在你的牙齿训练等候室?

“加亮”是本儿童杂志

我以为看起来会很酷
I thought it might look cool.

499
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:52,286

500
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:54,204
"我想看起来像只老虎"
"I want to look like a tiger,"

501
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:55,547
所以我戴了帽子
hence the hat.

502
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,273
我一定要看看

00:15:57,273 --> 00:15:57,944
不行
No way.

504
00:15:57,944 --> 00:15:58,615
求你
Please.

505
00:15:58,615 --> 00:16:00,054
我打赌看起来没那么遭
I bet it doesn't look that bad.

00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,784
你知道，我得说，在室内戴帽子
you know,it's very rude to wear a hat indoors.

520
00:16:29,784 --> 00:16:30,552
是很不礼貌的
I'm just saying.

521
00:16:30,552 --> 00:16:31,511

什么?

583
00:19:36,222 --> 00:19:37,085
为什么?

584
00:19:37,085 --> 00:19:38,044
我改变主意了
I changed my mind.

585
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:39,674
我不想见她
I don't want to meet her.

586
00:19:39,674 --> 00:19:41,976
为什么?她听起来完美极了

587
00:19:41,976 --> 00:19:43,414
我不想要完美
I don't want perfect.

588
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:45,524
我想要Robin
I want Robin.

589
00:19:46,963 --> 00:19:48,785
天，又是这个
god,not this again.

590
00:19:48,785 --> 00:19:50,032
Ted,这是个错误
Ted,it's a mistake.

591
00:19:50,032 --> 00:19:51,087
也许
Maybe.

592
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:54,252
但这是我必须犯的错误

593

错

594

这是你不必犯的错误

595

我有证据
Look at the evidence.

596
00:19:57,704 --> 00:20:00,006
你和Robin试了一次又一次...
You and Robin have tried this again and again...

597
00:20:00,006 --> 00:20:01,636
错误就是这么一回事
Here's the thing about mistakes.

598
00:20:01,636 --> 00:20:04,513
有时，即使你知道是个错误
Sometimes,even when you know something's
 a mistake,

599
00:20:04,513 --> 00:20:05,856
你还是要犯
you gotta make it anyway.

600
00:20:07,007 --> 00:20:09,117
见鬼,好烫的盘子
sweet damn that's a hot plate.

601
00:20:09,117 --> 00:20:10,651
嘿，牛奶坏了吗?
Hey,is this milk any good?

602
00:20:16,405 --> 00:20:19,283
即使是非常非常蠢的错误
Even really,really dumb mistakes

603
00:20:19,378 --> 00:20:21,297
