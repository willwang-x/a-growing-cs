3
00:00:12,787 --> 00:00:16,546
孩子们当你们单身时
致力于寻找终身幸福
Kids when you are single,all you're
looking for is happily all after.

4
00:00:16,796 --> 00:00:19,117
但是在你经历的所有爱情故事里
只有一次能圆满结局
But only one of your
stories can end that way,

5
00:00:19,299 --> 00:00:21,179
其它的则最终以一方受伤结束
the rest ended with somebody get hurt.

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,221
我将讲述的就是一个这样结束的故事
This is one of those stories,

7
00:00:23,634 --> 00:00:25,832
它因为一件衬衫而开始
that starts with a shirt.

8
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:27,873
- 衬衫?
- 听我说
- A shirt?
- just listen,

9
00:00:28,391 --> 00:00:31,268
要不是那件衬衫
这件事情是不可能发生的
because none of that would have
happened if it hadn't been for that shirt.

10
00:00:35,478 --> 00:00:38,221
- 不错的衬衫
- 是不? 是不?
- nice shirt
- Right? Right?

11
00:00:38,355 --> 00:00:41,395
看看这颜色
绿色和棕色混杂在一起
look at those colors,
green and brown together at last.

12
00:00:41,462 --> 00:00:43,198
新款吗,兄弟?新买的?
hot top,bro? is it new.

13
00:00:43,265 --> 00:00:44,272
最让人疯狂的是
that's the crazy part.

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,912
这件衬衫我已经买了6年了
I've had this shirt for 6 years

15
00:00:46,008 --> 00:00:47,677
一直到今天早晨
我完全没有注意到它
until this morning,
I was not into it at ll,

16
00:00:47,725 --> 00:00:50,074
但是现在
就象我的品味改变了
but now,
it's like my tastes changed.

17
00:00:50,113 --> 00:00:52,021
- 鼻屎
- 呃,你好,Barney
- Booger.
- yes,hello,barney.

18
00:00:52,424 --> 00:00:56,289
Barney给我50块钱
让我在直播报道里说些愚蠢的话
barney has offered me 50 bucks to say
some stupid word on a live news report.

19
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,504
不是什么蠢话,鼻屎
not some stupid word,booger.

20
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,362
我还是不会做这个
我是一个新闻记者
But I'm not doing it.
I am aournalist.

21
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,926
什么?!记者?!
What?! Journalist?!

22
00:01:03,022 --> 00:01:05,208
你只是在新闻的最后
做点边角料
You do the little fluff pieces
at the end of the news.

23
00:01:05,592 --> 00:01:07,932
老人 小孩 猴子
Old people. Babies. Monkeys.

24
00:01:08,037 --> 00:01:10,694
这不是新闻工作
只是... 婴儿做的幼稚事
That's not journalism.
That's just... things in a diaper.

25
00:01:11,758 --> 00:01:14,942
你可能还不知道
老板要我到...
For your information,
my boss is about to bump me up to...

26
00:01:15,364 --> 00:01:18,846
- 市政厅
- 市政厅?大人物
- the city hall beat.
- City hall? Miss thing.

27
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,085
我不会为了50块钱去说"鼻屎"
这会危及我的升迁
I'm not going to jeopardize my
promotion by saying "booger" for 50 bucks.

28
00:01:23,152 --> 00:01:24,216
当然不
Of course not.

29
00:01:24,514 --> 00:01:27,957
这回你说"乳头"的话
我将给出100块钱
'Cause now you're saying "nipple,"
and it's a hundred.

30
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:30,786
进入我的圈套吧
Step into my web.

31
00:01:33,404 --> 00:01:34,382
呃 这是谁的波旁酒？
Mmm. Whose bourbon is this?

32
00:01:34,612 --> 00:01:36,348
喔 我不知道
我们坐下的时候就在这了
Ooh,I don't know.
It was here when we sat down.

33
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,611
啊... 重点是...
Gahhh... the point is...

34
00:01:38,803 --> 00:01:40,501
我现在似乎开始喜欢波旁酒了
I seem to like bourbon now.

35
00:01:40,568 --> 00:01:41,959
我以前发誓讨厌波旁酒
I could've sworn I hated bourbon.

36
00:01:42,179 --> 00:01:44,107
首先是衬衫,现在又是波旁酒
First the shirt,now bourbon.

37
00:01:44,212 --> 00:01:46,955
我花了27年来形成对事物的喜恶,对吗?
I spent 27 years making up
my mind about things,right?

38
00:01:47,032 --> 00:01:48,691
看过一次就讨厌的电影
The movie I saw once and hated;

39
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:51,280
因为我去的时候在下雨而导致
再也不想去第二次的城市
the city I'll never go back to
'cause it was raining the day I visited.

40
00:01:51,453 --> 00:01:54,282
可能是时候对事物有一个新的看法了
Maybe it's time to start
forming some second impressions.

41
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,200
你终于又看《七宝奇谋》了吗?
You're finally gonna watch goonies again?

42
00:01:56,728 --> 00:01:58,780
"Sloth love chunk.
"Sloth love chunk.

43
00:01:59,835 --> 00:02:01,657
我不是说《七宝奇谋》 我指女生
Not goonies-- girls.

44
00:02:01,878 --> 00:02:03,326
如果以前有某个女生
What if there's someone from my past

45
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:05,378
我那时候觉得不适合我
who I thought was wrong for me at the time,

46
00:02:05,551 --> 00:02:07,833
但是其实她,就象这件衬衫
when in fact she,like this shirt,

47
00:02:08,112 --> 00:02:09,627
事实上很适合我?
is actually a perfect fit?

48
00:02:09,746 --> 00:02:10,183
等等
Hold up.

49
00:02:10,193 --> 00:02:12,964
只有两个原因
可以让你去约会以前已经交往过的女生
There are only two reasons to ever
date a girl you'velready dated:

50
00:02:13,242 --> 00:02:14,652
乳房... 移植
Breast... implants.

51
00:02:15,937 --> 00:02:17,174
你知道,这注意不坏
You know,this isn't a bad idea.

52
00:02:17,606 --> 00:02:19,860
让我想想...
Ted以前的女友精选辑
Let's think...
ted's greatest hits.

53
00:02:20,656 --> 00:02:22,363
Steph怎么样?
What about that girl steph?

54
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:23,897
Steph...
Steph...

55
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:25,911
好吧,这有点难说出口
okay,this is difficult to say:

56
00:02:26,266 --> 00:02:29,028
回溯到我住在洛衫机时
我一文不名
Back when I lived in L.A.,
I was pretty broke

57
00:02:29,095 --> 00:02:32,682
因此我花了一个月拍成人电影
so I spent a month making adult films.

58
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,387
哇 好吧...
Wow. Okay...

59
00:02:35,665 --> 00:02:37,324
你拍了多少部? 
h-how many did you make?

60
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,066
要说对从事色情业的人的看法
他们辛苦工作
Say what you will about the porn industry,
they're hard workers.

61
00:02:45,063 --> 00:02:47,336
那个女的怎么样 呃...
Jackie?
What about that chick,um...
jackie?

62
00:02:48,267 --> 00:02:50,645
...我的浴袍完全滑下去了
...And my bathing suit
had fallen completely off.

63
00:02:51,815 --> 00:02:53,580
我了解你的感受
有一次
I know the feeling. Once,

64
00:02:53,695 --> 00:02:55,507
我16的时候,开着车
when I was 16,I was driving,

65
00:02:55,574 --> 00:02:57,195
撞上了一个想搭便车的家伙
and I hit this hitchhiker.

66
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:00,504
我不知道他怎么样了--
只是继续开我的车
Don't know what happened to him--
just kept driving.

67
00:03:02,652 --> 00:03:03,928
呃... 不要
uh... no.

68
00:03:04,676 --> 00:03:06,344
Natalie呢?
What about natalie?

69
00:03:07,342 --> 00:03:09,519
Natalie...
Natalie...

70
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,871
谁是Natalie?
who's natalie?

71
00:03:11,236 --> 00:03:12,319
Natalie
Natalie.

72
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:14,314
我和她有很多美好的回忆
I had so many fond memories of her:

73
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,884
她茶几上的蜡烛
The tea candles on her dresser,

74
00:03:17,527 --> 00:03:19,589
她床上收集的袜子猴
the sock monkey collection on her bed,

75
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:22,744
她一直在听的格拉丝高的歌
that one belle & sebastian
song she always listened to,

76
00:03:23,406 --> 00:03:24,461
她的微笑...
her smile...

77
00:03:25,755 --> 00:03:28,306
天那,我有大概3年没见过她了
man,I haven't seen her in,
like,three years.

78
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:29,477
嗯 你们为什么会分手
Well,why'd you guys break up

79
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:31,299
那时候我并不想做出承诺
I just wasn't looking for a big
commitment at the time.

80
00:03:31,356 --> 00:03:33,428
当然
现在看来这样并不坏
Of course,
now a big commitment doesn't seem so bad.

81
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:35,403
也许我应该找她
你们怎么想?
Maybe I should call her.
What do you guys think?

82
00:03:35,768 --> 00:03:38,750
你甩了一个三级明星?
You dumped a porn star?

83
00:03:39,048 --> 00:03:40,189
我们的友谊完了
Friendship over.

84
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,778
我们的友谊完了!
Friendship over!

85
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,499
进来!
come in!

86
00:03:47,037 --> 00:03:48,139
好吧,一会再找我
All right,get back to me,then.

87
00:03:48,734 --> 00:03:50,978
- 你想见我吗 Adam先生
- 是的
- You wanted to see me,mr. Adams.
- Yes,I did.

88
00:03:51,362 --> 00:03:52,781
我需要你去报道一个故事
I need you to cover a story.

89
00:03:53,721 --> 00:03:54,987
就在市政厅那边
It's down at city hall.

90
00:03:55,179 --> 00:03:56,483
市政厅?
City hall?

91
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:58,238
噢 天那
Oh,my god.

92
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:02,209
那么 下次当你经过市政厅时
so,next time you're passing city hall,

93
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:05,383
别忘了找到这个纽约
最古老的热狗贩卖车
make sure and stop by
new york's oldest hot dog cart.

94
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:08,337
今时今日
一个美味的热狗将花去你2.50元
Today,a delicious hot
dog will cost you $2.50,

95
00:04:08,404 --> 00:04:11,703
但是回溯到1955年
but back when the
stand first opened,in 1955,

96
00:04:11,761 --> 00:04:13,976
你可以仅用一个乳头买到一个热狗
you could get one for only a nipple.

97
00:04:14,062 --> 00:04:17,841
现场直播 Robin Trubotsky
来自都市新闻一台
Reporting live,robin trubotsky,
metro news one.

98
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:19,596
我在新闻上说了"乳头"
I said "nipple" on the news.

99
00:04:19,663 --> 00:04:22,876
这太不专业了!
我在新闻上说了"乳头"!
That was so unprofessional!
I said "nipple" on the news!

100
00:04:23,154 --> 00:04:24,794
至少比"鼻屎"好
At least it's better than "booger."

101
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:26,942
鼻屎
booger.

102
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:30,692
你在这呢
there she is.

103
00:04:31,047 --> 00:04:34,001
嘿,这里很冷吗?
我几乎可以见Robin的钱袋儿了
Hey,is it cold in here?
'Cause I can kinda see robin's nickels.

104
00:04:36,283 --> 00:04:38,777
现在 为了你的下一次挑战...
now,for your next challenge...

105
00:04:38,834 --> 00:04:41,299
不会再有什么挑战了
我不在乎你给出多少钱
there is not going to be another challenge.
I don't care how much you offer me.

106
00:04:41,587 --> 00:04:43,994
噢 扪心自问Robin
Oh,search your soul,robin.

107
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:45,806
我们都知道这跟钱没有关系
You and I both know this
wasn't about the money.

108
00:04:46,113 --> 00:04:49,086
当然，都市新闻一台付你的薪水，Jack
但是……
Sure,metro news one pays you jack,
and,hey,

109
00:04:49,326 --> 00:04:53,095
多吃点蔬菜沙拉对
对你，我和Mcgee先生都有好处
a little green salad on the side
is good for you,me,and mr. Mcgee.

110
00:04:53,412 --> 00:04:55,138
说真的，谁这么说话？
Seriously,who talks like that?

111
00:04:55,512 --> 00:04:56,788
小宝贝真正得到的……
What baby really likes

112
00:04:56,835 --> 00:05:01,218
给那些工于心计不赏识你
更不会提拔你的人……
is the thrill of pulling one over on
those bean-counters who underappreciate you,

113
00:05:01,487 --> 00:05:03,146
教训一下的刺激感
and still haven't promoted you,

114
00:05:03,549 --> 00:05:05,850
那么为了另外两百大洋
and so for two more hundie sticks,

115
00:05:05,927 --> 00:05:08,862
小宝贝会看这镜头说...
baby's going to look in
the camera and say this.

116
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:13,456
我只是在设想
M just assuming.

117
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:15,834
我得回去工作了
I gotta get back to work.

118
00:05:17,081 --> 00:05:18,088
- 回头见
- 拜
- See ya.
- Bye.

119
00:05:18,797 --> 00:05:20,131
小宝贝会去考虑下这个
Baby's gonna think about it.

120
00:05:23,276 --> 00:05:25,453
找到啦!
我找到Natalie的电话了
found it!
I found natalie's number.

121
00:05:25,837 --> 00:05:28,666
嘿 Ted! 不错的衬衫!
又回到昨天了吗?
Hey,ted! Nice shirt!
Is it yesterday already?

122
00:05:30,565 --> 00:05:33,126
我要给她打电话 这有点疯狂
I am calling her. This is crazy.

123
00:05:33,193 --> 00:05:34,881
我大概有3年没跟她讲过话了
I haven't talked to her in,
like,three years.

124
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,904
不知道她是不是还记得我
Wonder if she even remembers me.

125
00:05:39,695 --> 00:05:41,153
- 你好?
- Natalie
- hello?
- Natalie.

126
00:05:42,112 --> 00:05:43,147
- 我是Ted Mosby
- It's ted mosby.

127
00:05:43,387 --> 00:05:44,624
- 去死吧
- Go to hell.

128
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:49,659
她还记得我
She remembers me.

129
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:55,913
为什么Natalie挂你电话?
why would natalie hang up on you?

130
00:05:56,258 --> 00:05:57,217
我不知道
I don't know.

131
00:05:57,227 --> 00:05:59,135
- 你和她姐姐睡过了吗?
- 没有
- Did you sleep with her sister?
- No.

132
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:01,207
- 那你和她妈妈睡过了?
- 也没有
- Did you sleep with her mom?
- No.

133
00:06:01,533 --> 00:06:02,837
我正对你的故事失去兴趣
I'm losing interest in your story.

134
00:06:04,525 --> 00:06:06,261
嗯 你一定做了什么事情她才会这样
Well,you must have done something.

135
00:06:06,347 --> 00:06:07,738
你们为什么分手?
Why did you guys break up?

136
00:06:08,045 --> 00:06:09,694
他还没为做出承诺准备好
He wasn't ready for a commitment.

137
00:06:12,015 --> 00:06:14,116
那时她的生日快到了
And her birthday might've been coming up.

138
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:17,837
好吧 我不想给一个我即将提出分手的人
okay,so I didn't want to
get a boyfriend-level gift

139
00:06:17,885 --> 00:06:19,601
送一份男朋友级别的礼物
for a girl I was just
about to break up with.

140
00:06:19,726 --> 00:06:21,778
所以你在她生日前甩了她?
So you dumped her
right before her birthday?

141
00:06:21,826 --> 00:06:24,684
不是 我没在生日前甩她
No,I didn't dump her
right before her birthday.

142
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:30,611
Natalie! 嘿
生日快乐
Natalie! Hey.
Happy birthday.

143
00:06:32,299 --> 00:06:33,268
听着...
Listen...

144
00:06:33,517 --> 00:06:37,871
- 永远都不能在女生的生日那天提出分手!
- Lily 别这样! 衬衫!
- Never break up with a girl on her birthday!
- Lily,please! The shirt!

145
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,962
我知道!我犯了个错误!
I know! It was a mistake!

146
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:42,455
好吧 她把眼睛给哭肿了吗?
Well,did she cry her eyes out?

147
00:06:42,561 --> 00:06:44,412
- 我不知道
- 你怎么会...?!
- I don't know.
- How do you not...?!

148
00:06:45,937 --> 00:06:47,615
不是吧你
You didn'T.

149
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:50,300
Natalie! 嘿 生日快乐
Natalie! Hey,happy birthday.

150
00:06:51,998 --> 00:06:53,043
听着...
Listen...

151
00:06:55,124 --> 00:06:56,352
你很不错
you're awesome.

152
00:06:56,831 --> 00:06:58,068
真的不错
You really are.

153
00:06:58,567 --> 00:06:59,584
很不错
Awesome.

154
00:07:00,006 --> 00:07:02,422
我现在很忙 所以...
I'm just like super-busy
right now,so...

155
00:07:02,633 --> 00:07:05,280
也许我们之间还是画上休止符吧
maybe we should just...
call it a day.

156
00:07:07,112 --> 00:07:08,503
但是你很不错
But you're awesome.

157
00:07:08,982 --> 00:07:11,150
在电话答录机上!?
On her answering machine!?

158
00:07:11,476 --> 00:07:13,528
- Lily 别这样
- 在她生日那天?!
- Lily,come on.
- And on her birthday?!

159
00:07:13,643 --> 00:07:18,007
噢 谁会在对方生日那天而且是答录机上提出分手?!
Oh,who breaks up with somebody on
their answering machine on her birthday?!

160
00:07:18,074 --> 00:07:19,743
是啊 兄弟 你该发E-mail说
Yeah,dude. E-mail.

161
00:07:20,213 --> 00:07:23,023
这不是我想表达的重点Marshall
Not exactly the point I
was trying to make,marshall.

162
00:07:23,445 --> 00:07:26,159
这样提出分手太可怕了
That is a terrible way
to break up with someone.

163
00:07:26,264 --> 00:07:27,674
好吧 我为我的当事人辩护
Okay,in my client's defense,

164
00:07:27,722 --> 00:07:30,167
有什么方法与人分手是不可怕的吗?
没有
is there an unterrible way
to break up with somebody? No.

165
00:07:30,455 --> 00:07:32,853
就我个人而言
我宁愿从答录机上听到坏消息...
Personally,I'd rather hear the
bad news on an answering machine...

166
00:07:32,882 --> 00:07:36,305
比面对面觉得丢脸好
这是一种减轻对对方伤害的方法
than face the humiliation in person.
It's the least painful way you can do it.

167
00:07:36,727 --> 00:07:38,828
- 你在给谁打电话?
- 嗨 Marshall 我是Lily
- Who are you calling?
- Hi,marshall,it's lily.

168
00:07:38,914 --> 00:07:40,909
至少一个月内我们不会做爱
We're not gonnhave sex for at least a month,

169
00:07:41,148 --> 00:07:43,095
但是你很不错 好了 拜拜
but you're awesome. Okay,bye-bye.

170
00:07:44,227 --> 00:07:47,056
不 这是一个很大的错误
Ted 你应该当面说分手
No,that was a big mistake,
ted. You should've done it in person.

171
00:07:47,238 --> 00:07:48,245
谢谢
Thank you.

172
00:07:48,332 --> 00:07:51,151
“疯狂绝望的别离开我”性爱
……妙不可言
Desperate,
please-don't-leave-me sex is amazing.

173
00:07:52,302 --> 00:07:54,201
好吧
这很幼稚愚蠢 我只是...
Okay,
it was childish and stupid. I ju...

174
00:07:54,728 --> 00:07:56,090
我不想看见她哭
I didn't want to see her cry.

175
00:07:56,186 --> 00:07:58,459
嗯 猜猜怎么样 她还是哭了
Well,guess what she cried.

176
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,221
你只是没种面对那些眼泪
You just didn't have
the sack to face those tears.

177
00:08:01,288 --> 00:08:02,736
我以前就是那样 好不?
That was me then,okay?

178
00:08:02,823 --> 00:08:05,863
现在是一个崭新的
穿着以前的衬衫的有种的Ted
This is the new,
old-shirt- wearing,sack-having ted.

179
00:08:06,074 --> 00:08:07,292
我要去把这事纠正过来
I'm gonna make this right.

180
00:08:07,369 --> 00:08:08,606
你们知道吗?
我的妹妹...
You know what else?
"My younger sister...

181
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,735
...“新婚而且快三十岁”性爱
...just got married and
I'm about to turn 30" sex.

182
00:08:10,764 --> 00:08:12,452
太棒了
Fantastic.

183
00:08:14,082 --> 00:08:16,297
本来应该值得高兴的事
An occasion that was
supposed to be joyous,

184
00:08:16,336 --> 00:08:19,558
变成了悲剧
因为Ethel和Sadie Margolis
suddenly turned tragic
when ethel and sadie margolis,

185
00:08:19,577 --> 00:08:21,179
纽约最老的一对双胞胎
new york's oldest twins,

186
00:08:21,255 --> 00:08:23,164
在他们的100岁生日那晚
suddenly passed away on this,

187
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,523
突然过世
the eve of their 100th birthday.

188
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:28,045
我是个下流，下流的女生
I'm a dirty,dirty girl.

189

196
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:56,145
你也养狗 不是吗?
你觉得这是怎么回事?
You have dogs,right?
What do you think that means?

197
00:08:56,443 --> 00:08:57,689
带他去看兽医?
Take him to the vet?

198
00:08:58,917 --> 00:08:59,943
天才
genius.

199
00:09:00,231 --> 00:09:01,516
我欠你个人情
That's one I owe you.

- 这就是你想说的吗?

纽约爱你
你是个超级明星 拜拜
New york loves you.
You're a superstar. Bye-bye.

203
00:09:14,118 --> 00:09:15,988
那时候Robin明白了没人
That's when robin
realized that no one

204
00:09:16,045 --> 00:09:18,673
甚至包括她的老板
也不看都市新闻一台
not even her boss,
watched metro news one.

205
00:09:29,386 --> 00:09:30,412
嗨
hi.

206
00:09:32,934 --> 00:09:35,514
Natalie!别这样!
我只想说我很抱歉
natalie! Come on!
I just want to say I'm sorry.

207
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,912
我来这只是因为你不接我电话
I only came down here
'cause you woul't take my call.

208
00:09:38,027 --> 00:09:39,302
嘿 我有个主意--
Hey,here's an idea--

209
00:09:39,504 --> 00:09:41,518
你怎么不用答录机?
why don't you leave a message?

210
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:44,548
很好笑
good one.

211
00:09:44,711 --> 00:09:47,454
好 好吧 我把这个袜子猴留下就走
Okay,fine,I'm just going
to leave this sock monkey here.

212
00:09:48,164 --> 00:09:49,276
再见

我知道你很生气 但是...
look,look,look.
I know you're mad,but...

215
00:09:58,771 --> 00:10:00,765
生日快乐 3年前的祝福
happy birthday.Three years ago.

216
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:03,355
噢 是吗?随你便 3年前
Oh,yeah? Up yours three years ago.

217
00:10:03,777 --> 00:10:06,242
听着听着
给你留那个言我真是个白痴
Look,look,
I was an idiot leaving that message.

218
00:10:06,385 --> 00:10:07,968
我意识到那样有多另人讨厌
I realize how much that sucked.

219
00:10:08,812 --> 00:10:09,780
不 你没有
No,you don'T.

220
00:10:10,385 --> 00:10:12,571
也许我们之间还是画上休止符吧
Maybe we should just call it a day.

221
00:10:13,895 --> 00:10:15,621
但是你很不错
But you're awesome.

222
00:10:17,453 --> 00:10:18,575
好吧 拜
Okay,bye.

223
00:10:21,423 --> 00:10:23,111
惊喜吧
Surprise.

224
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,286
那天晚上有一个惊喜派对吗?
There was a surprise party that night?

225
00:10:26,842 --> 00:10:28,280
为什么没人告诉我?
How come nobody told me?

226
00:10:28,415 --> 00:10:30,975
人们认为我不能保守秘密
但是我完全可以
People think I can't keep a secret,
but I totally can.

227
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,181
抱歉 和这个没关系
Sorry,not the issue.

228
00:10:33,498 --> 00:10:34,543
听着Natalie
Look,natalie,

229
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:37,583
我那时是一个愚蠢的小孩
害怕做出承诺
I was just a stupid kid back then,
terrified of commitment.

230
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,288
我猜你突然做好准备结婚然安定下来
And I suppose you're suddenly
ready to get married and settle down.

231
00:10:41,036 --> 00:10:42,551
嗯 事实上是的
Well,yeah,actually.

232
00:10:43,395 --> 00:10:44,642
我现在完全不同了
I'm a different guy now.

233
00:10:45,898 --> 00:10:47,135
再给我一次机会
Give me another chance,

234
00:10:47,384 --> 00:10:50,319
你大概觉得我完全没有自尊吧
You must think I have
absolutely no self-respect.

235
00:10:50,377 --> 00:10:52,554
别这样 只是一起喝点咖啡
Come on,just a cup of coffee.

236
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:57,761
请别这样 Natalie
给他个机会
Please,natalie.
Give the guy a chance.

237
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,437
别太高傲了
Self-respect is overrated.

238
00:11:08,963 --> 00:11:10,104
可能是咖啡因的作用
Maybe it was the caffeine,

239
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,511
你的技巧完全提升了个等级
but you really brought your
game up to a whole new level.

240
00:11:12,751 --> 00:11:13,624
谢谢
Thanks.

241
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,523

252

Krav maga.

Natalie's awesome.

263
00:12:06,021 --> 00:12:08,668
我知道 她很棒
但是我必须和她分手
I know,she's terrific,
but I have to break up with her.

264
00:12:10,231 --> 00:12:13,540
为什么你不能
不去烦那个可怜的女孩?
Why couldn't you
leave that poor girl alone?

265
00:12:13,626 --> 00:12:14,988
我知道 我讨厌这样
I know. Hate this.

266
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:16,695
过去3周很我们处的不错
These past three weeks have been great.

267
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:18,095
我应该爱上她 但是
I should be in love with her,but

268
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:19,908
我没找到感觉
I'm not feeling that thing.

269
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,653
不知道怎么用语言表达
It's ineffable.

270
00:12:21,797 --> 00:12:23,888
表达不出来 说的好
Ineffable. Good word.

271
00:12:24,761 --> 00:12:25,988
那么你准备什么时候和她分手?
So when are you going to do it?

272
00:12:26,238 --> 00:12:27,561
她现在可能在地铁站了
She's probably on the subway by now.

273
00:12:27,628 --> 00:12:28,798
你可以给她语音信箱留言
You could call her voice mail:

274
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,225
哔! "甩掉" 挂电话 搞定
Beep! "Dumped." Click. DE. No,

275
00:12:32,443 --> 00:12:33,891
我必须面对面去做
I have to do this face-to-face.

276
00:12:33,939 --> 00:12:35,607
我只是
不知道该怎么说
I just,
I don't know what I'm going to say.

277
00:12:35,732 --> 00:12:37,199
"我还没准备好做出承诺"
"I'm not ready for a commitment."

278
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,820
噢 这太老套了
Oh,that's such a cliche.

279
00:12:38,878 --> 00:12:40,988
这不是老套 是经典
It's not a cliche,it's a classic.

280
00:12:41,189 --> 00:12:43,337
在分手规则里这是
"通往天堂的阶梯"
It's the "stairway to heaven"
of breakup lines.

281
00:12:43,807 --> 00:12:45,907
嗯 Natalie应该受到更好的对待
Well, I think natalie deserves better.

282
00:12:46,003 --> 00:12:48,679
更好
分手时没有好不好
Better.
There's no "better" in breaking up.

283
00:12:48,737 --> 00:12:49,974
只有少另人难堪点
There's only "less awful."

284
00:12:50,022 --> 00:12:51,892
分手理由老套就老套
A cliché is a cliché for a reason.

285
00:12:51,969 --> 00:12:54,251
这更让人舒服点
没关系
It's comforting. It doesn't matter.

286
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,284
我已经告诉她我准备好做出承诺了
所以...
I already told her I am
ready for a commitment,so...

287
00:12:56,917 --> 00:12:59,449
噢 天那 没办法逃脱了 我得和她结婚了
oh,my god. There's no way out.
I'm gonna have to marry her.

288
00:12:59,564 --> 00:13:01,444
不 不 我们会帮你摆脱困境
No,no,we're gonna get you out of this.

289
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,314
嗯 这个...
Okay,hoabout...

290
00:13:04,321 --> 00:13:05,270
"这不是你的错 是我的问题"?
"it's not you,it's me"?

291
00:13:06,421 --> 00:13:10,037
几个字-- "你穿牛仔裤显的很胖"
你就可以自由离开
six words-- "you look fat in those jeans."
You're free to go.

292
00:13:11,312 --> 00:13:14,103
Ted你考虑过告诉她事实吗?
Ted,have you considered
telling her the truth?

293
00:13:16,626 --> 00:13:18,198
认真的说 亲爱的
我们男人正在这想办法
seriously,honey,
men are working here.

294
00:13:19,311 --> 00:13:22,389
Ted什么才是事实?
为什么你要和她分手?
Ted,what is the truth?
Why do you want to break up with her?

295
00:13:22,562 --> 00:13:25,008
事实?她不是我要的那个
The truth? She's not the one.

296
00:13:25,113 --> 00:13:27,443
- 那么就那样告诉她
- 噢 你不能告诉她这个
- So tell her that.
- Oh,you can't tell her that.

297
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,064
- 这太恐怖了
- 为什么?
- hat's horrible.
- Why?

298
00:13:29,103 --> 00:13:31,059
这有什么好恐怖的?
What is so horrible about that?

299
00:13:31,165 --> 00:13:34,512
对 这有什么好恐怖的?
她不是我要的那个
Yeah,what is so horrible about that?
She's not the one.

300
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,717
这个听起来很让人伤心吗?
Why is that such a
heartbreaking thing to hear?

301
00:13:36,861 --> 00:13:39,307
一个人找到他的另一半的机会
The chances of one person
being another person's "the one"

302
00:13:39,393 --> 00:13:41,062
大概是60亿分之1
are,like,six billion-to-one.

303
00:13:41,091 --> 00:13:43,527
对啊 这比你中彩票还难
Yeah,you have better
chances of winning the lottery.

304
00:13:43,575 --> 00:13:46,480
完全正确!
如果没中彩票你不会认为是自己的错
Exactly! You wouldn't take it
personally if you lost the lottery.

305
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,322
好吧 伙计 告诉她事实
All right,man,tell her the truth.

306
00:13:48,552 --> 00:13:49,856
她肯定会哭
She's gonna cry.

307
00:13:49,885 --> 00:13:53,002
嗯 他将会处理的象个男人
Yeah,and he's gonna sit there
and he's gonna take it like a man.

308
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,565
我得做的成熟点
I have to do the mature thing.

309
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,205
想谈谈成熟吗?
Want to talk mature?

310
00:13:56,224 --> 00:13:59,686
我刚刚在报道的最后
拍了自己的屁股
I just wrapped up a live
newscast by honking my own boobs.

311
00:14:00,808 --> 00:14:02,985
一个伟大的节目诞生了
And great tv was had by all.

312
00:14:04,645 --> 00:14:07,378
好吧Trubotsky
新的挑战 这个更猛
All right,trubotsky,
new challenge,and this one's big.

313
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:09,373
钱也更多
But so is the cash reward.

314
00:14:09,411 --> 00:14:12,384
整整1,000块
你听清我说的了吧
For $1,000-- you heard me--

315
00:14:12,566 --> 00:14:15,319
你只要在新闻里做这个
all you have to do is get up
there on the news and do one of these.

316
00:14:23,288 --> 00:14:24,506
这是什么鬼东西?
What the hell is that?

317
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:28,122
- Ickey舞
- 你做这个的时候，边做边说
- The ickey shuffle.
- And as you do it,you say this:

318
00:14:28,189 --> 00:14:29,743
Elbert "惹人厌" woods
(Elber Ickey Woods,橄榄球星)
（Ickey舞是他的招牌庆祝动作）
Elbert "icky" woods,

319
00:14:29,762 --> 00:14:32,227
孟加拉虎队91年的时候
和你解约真是愚蠢
the bengals were fools
to cut you in '91.

320
00:14:32,284 --> 00:14:34,049
你总共1,525码的冲刺……
Your 1,525 rushing yards and

321
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:36,792
27次触地得分不会被忘记
your 27 touchdowns
will not be forgotten.

322
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,733
所以Dave Shula教练（在任期间解约了Elbert）
去你妈的还有你的烂牛排店
（离开教练席后，Dave开了牛排餐厅）
So coach dave shula,
screw you and your crappy steakhouse.

323
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,291
写下来给我
Just write it down for me.

324
00:14:45,154 --> 00:14:47,447
有什么好在乎的? 
无论如何根本没人在看 对吗?
What do I care? It's not like
anyo's watching,anyway,right?

325
00:14:49,844 --> 00:14:51,944
天那 她肯定会哭
Man,she's gonna cry.

326
00:14:54,006 --> 00:14:56,020
这就是恋爱法则 小子
It's the law of love,chunk.

327
00:14:57,277 --> 00:14:58,571
谢谢你Lily
Thanks,lil.

328
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:01,708
就那样 第2天晚上 我带Natalie出去吃饭...
So,the next night,I took natalie out to dinner...

329
00:15:02,091 --> 00:15:03,482
去做成熟的事
to do the mature thing.

330
00:15:04,441 --> 00:15:06,512
听着 呃 Natalie
有些话我必须得说
Look,uh,natalie,
there's something I haveo say.

331
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,421
噢 等等 我件事我得先说
Oh,wait,wait. There's
something I have to say first.

332
00:15:08,613 --> 00:15:11,471
今天 工作时 我不只收到一个两个
Today,at work,
I had not one,not two,

333
00:15:11,643 --> 00:15:15,297
而是三个生日蛋糕
所以今晚 我们直接跳过蛋糕吧?
but three birthday cakes.
So tonight,can we just skip the cake?

334
00:15:16,314 --> 00:15:17,618
今天是你生日吗?
Today's your birthday?

335
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,083
对
不 没关系 我没告诉任何人
Yeah. No,it's okay,
I wasn't telling anyone about it.

336
00:15:20,131 --> 00:15:22,624
今天是你生日! 我...
Today's your birthday! I...

337
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:27,026
我什么都没为你准备
I didn't get you anything.

338
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,618
噢 没关系
Oh,it's okay.

339
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,514
你知道 你已经给了我最好的生日礼物
You know,you've already given me the best present of all.

340
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:34,526
我又能相信人了
I can trust again.

341
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:38,995
不用客气
You're welcome.

342
00:15:44,183 --> 00:15:45,804
噢 先生 再来点酒
Oh,sir,much more wine.

343
00:15:52,671 --> 00:15:53,486
Henry
Henry,

344
00:15:53,505 --> 00:15:56,804
作为纽约最老最英俊的马车夫
你见过如此多的事情
as new york's oldest hansom cab driver,
you've seen quite a lot.

345
00:15:57,188 --> 00:15:59,106
在你工作的过去60年里
In your past 60 years on the job,

346
00:15:59,164 --> 00:16:00,967
哪件事是让你最激动的?
what is your most exciting memory?

347
00:16:01,887 --> 00:16:03,863
嗯... 啊 就是这里
Well... ah,this is it.

348
00:16:04,553 --> 00:16:05,925
噢 伙计 要开始了
Oh,boy,here we go.

349
00:16:05,992 --> 00:16:08,313
各位 各位 如果你能停下来看电视
Everyone,everyone,if I may direct your attention to the television.

350
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,643
你将看到一些不可思议的事情
You are about to see something amazing.

351
00:16:10,912 --> 00:16:13,127
后来在我72岁时
And then,in '72,

352
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:15,170
Mickey Mantle
（纽约扬基队球星）
mickey mantle

353
00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:18,575
第4次坐我的马车
rode my cab for the fourth time.

354
00:16:18,623 --> 00:16:19,773
来吧 宝贝
Come on,baby.

355
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,847
露一手
Bring it home.

356
00:16:20,895 --> 00:16:23,514
但是最让我激动的时刻
But the most exciting moment--

357
00:16:23,821 --> 00:16:27,292
是现在这一刻
that would have to be this one,
right now.

358
00:16:27,964 --> 00:16:28,951
什么?
What?

359
00:16:29,325 --> 00:16:31,809
看看我
我上电视了
Look at me.
I'm on tv.

360
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:35,118
我从来没想过我能讲自己的故事
I never thought I'd have my story told.

361
00:16:36,336 --> 00:16:38,599
谢谢你Robin Trubotsky小姐
Thank you,

362
00:16:39,319 --> 00:16:40,489
谢谢
Thank you.

363
00:16:40,537 --> 00:16:41,304
接着
And right then,

364
00:16:41,313 --> 00:16:44,421
Robin阿姨认识到
她的工作是多么的重要
aunt robin realized how
important her job truly was.

365
00:16:44,584 --> 00:16:46,914
能报道你的故事
我很荣幸，Henry
It's an honor to tell your story,
henry.

366
00:16:48,247 --> 00:16:51,796
你要知道都市新闻一台在传媒业中
也许并不是最好的节目
You know,metro news one may
not be number one in viewership,

367
00:16:51,872 --> 00:16:54,232
但是我很骄傲...
哇!
but this reporter takes pride in...
whoa!

368
00:16:54,807 --> 00:16:57,473
噢...! 噢 天那
我跌到马屎里了!
Oh...! Oh,my god,
I'm covered in horse crap!

369
00:16:57,569 --> 00:17:00,341
噢 天那 弄到我头发上了
Oh,my god,it's in my hair.

370
00:17:01,194 --> 00:17:02,470
你计划的吗?
You planned that?

371
00:17:03,266 --> 00:17:04,532
不是 Marshall
No,marshall.

372
00:17:05,165 --> 00:17:07,246
这已经超越了我的想象
That was beyond my wildest dreams.

373
00:17:08,905 --> 00:17:10,977
那么 如果你去阿拉巴马
So,if you ever come to alabama,

374
00:17:11,034 --> 00:17:13,739
我妈妈会给你煮那些巨大的龙虾
my mom throws the huge crawfish boils,

375
00:17:13,758 --> 00:17:15,925
顺便说下 她很想见你
and she's just dying to meet you,
by the way.

376
00:17:16,021 --> 00:17:17,594
听着Natalie
有些话我必须得说
Look,natalie,
there's something I ha to say,

377
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,378
呃 想不到什么好的方式说这个
and,uh,
there's no good way to say it.

378
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:21,871
我想分手
I want to break up.

379
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:24,633
我不认为你就是我要的那个人
I don't think you're the one for me.

380
00:17:25,736 --> 00:17:28,642
我不想浪费你的时间
因为我真的喜欢你
I don't want to waste your time,
because I really like you.

381
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:30,666
我不想对你做错事
I want to do right by you,

382
00:17:30,752 --> 00:17:33,552
最好的方式就是我应该对你诚实
and I think the best way for
me to do that is just to be honest.

383
00:17:34,492 --> 00:17:35,394
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

384
00:17:38,539 --> 00:17:39,853
噢 天那 哭出来吧
Oh,god,just let it out.

385
00:17:41,205 --> 00:17:42,692
只有眼泪能缓解伤痛
They're only tears.

386
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,540
我不是你要的那个?!
I'm not the one for you?!

387
00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:52,186
我很抱歉 我只是... 
我 我 我认为成熟的做法是...
I'm sorry,I just... I-I-I
thought thmature thing to do...

388
00:17:52,234 --> 00:17:54,335
- 今天是我生日!
- 是 我知道 我没意识到...
- it's my birthday!
- Yes,I know. I didn't realize...

389
00:17:54,402 --> 00:17:58,248
今天是我生日你却跟我说
我不是你想要的那个人?!
it's my birthday,and you're
telling me I'm not the one for you?!

390
00:17:58,324 --> 00:17:59,859
这真的没什么大不了
It's really not such a big deal.

391
00:17:59,897 --> 00:18:02,755
我是说 这跟你没中彩票一样
I mean,the odds--
it's like you lost the lottery.

392
00:18:02,841 --> 00:18:05,066
噢 跟你约会就象中了彩票?!
Oh,so dating you is
like winning the lottery?!

393
00:18:05,124 --> 00:18:06,601
不 噢 不 噢
我不是那意思
No,no,no,no,
I didn't mean that.

394
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,030
好吧 那问题在哪?!
Okay,so what's the problem?!

395
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:09,181
我... 我...
I... I...

396
00:18:09,209 --> 00:18:10,715
我不知道怎么解释
I can't explain it.

397
00:18:10,773 --> 00:18:11,549
试一下!
Try!

398
00:18:11,597 --> 00:18:13,189
这是... 不知道怎么表达
It'S... ineffable.

399
00:18:13,688 --> 00:18:15,453
我不能表达?
I'm not effable?

400
00:18:16,134 --> 00:18:16,843
不 不 不 不
No,no,no,no.

401
00:18:16,997 --> 00:18:19,682
"不能表达" 不能表达指解释不了
"Ineffable." Ineffable
means it can't be explained.

402
00:18:19,721 --> 00:18:22,061
- 噢 我很蠢吗?
- 噢 天那 到底怎么了?
- Oh,so I'm stupid?
- Oh,god,what's going on?

403
00:18:22,128 --> 00:18:25,110
好吧 怎么了是你伤了我的心
Okay,what's going on
is you broke my heart

404
00:18:25,254 --> 00:18:28,237
我生日在电话答录机上
over my answering
machine on my birthday,

405
00:18:28,294 --> 00:18:30,893
花了3年忘记你
waited three years
for me to get over you,

406
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,109
你却又找到我 求我与你和好
tracked me down,
begged me to go out th you again,

407
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:36,216
只是为了你能在3周后甩掉我
only so you could
dump me three weeks later,

408
00:18:36,274 --> 00:18:37,961
再一次在我生日时候!
again,on my birthday!

409
00:18:38,431 --> 00:18:41,040
不 这 这 这不象你想的那样
我只是...
No,it's-it's-it's not like that.
I'm just...

410
00:18:41,117 --> 00:18:42,104
这 这 这 是...
it's-it's-it'S...

411
00:18:42,258 --> 00:18:45,519
- 什么?!
- 我只是 只是现在很忙
- what?!
- I'm just,like,so busy right now.

412
00:18:46,823 --> 00:18:48,271
记得Natalie说...
Remember when natalie said...

413
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,832
半小时后我有Krav Maga课
I have my krav maga
class in half an hour.

414
00:18:51,273 --> 00:18:53,891
Krav Maga并不是瑜伽的一种
Turns out krav maga
is not a kind of yoga.

415
00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:56,998
是以色列军队发明的
用于街头游击战的拳术
It's a form of guerilla street
fighting developed by the israeli army.

416
00:19:01,861 --> 00:19:04,671
这是吧台那两位绅士的致敬
This is compliments of those
two gentlemen at the bar.

417
00:19:05,716 --> 00:19:09,370
- 我的膝盖!
- 弄到我头发上了!
- My knee!
- It's in my hair!

418
00:19:11,633 --> 00:19:13,657
知道人们在看这节目
不值得高兴吗?
But isn't nice to
know people are watching?

419
00:19:17,608 --> 00:19:19,622
噢 天那 你还好吧?
Oh,my god. Are you all right?

420
00:19:19,699 --> 00:19:21,348
你怎么了?
Wh happened to you?

421
00:19:22,183 --> 00:19:23,420
我说出了事实
I told the truth.

422
00:19:23,487 --> 00:19:26,546
事实意味着一记大抡拳
Turns out the truth has
a mean roundhouse kick.

423
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:27,870
噢 伙计
Oh,man.

424
00:19:27,947 --> 00:19:30,651
噢 你做对了 我为你骄傲
Oh,well,you did the right thing.
I'm proud of you.

425
00:19:30,699 --> 00:19:32,157
我的心在滴血
I'm bleeding internally.

426
00:19:32,723 --> 00:19:34,430
嘿Ted你知道当我失落的时候
什么让我振作起来吗?
Hey,ted,you know what always
picks me up when I'm down?

427
00:19:34,487 --> 00:19:35,772
其他人的不幸
Other people's misfortune.

428
00:19:35,782 --> 00:19:37,105
你错过了精彩的事
You missed something so amazing.

429
00:19:37,153 --> 00:19:39,935
天那 整个酒吧就不能留一个
没看到我的糗事的人吗?
Please,can we just have one person
in this whole bar who didn't see it?

430
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:41,085
好吧
Fine.

431
00:19:41,977 --> 00:19:43,128
你还好吧?
Are you okay?

432
00:19:43,665 --> 00:19:45,871
我真的觉得我这次用了很好的方式
I really thought I was doing
it the good way this time.

433
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,760
我猜根本就没有什么好的方法
I guess there is no good way.

434
00:19:48,173 --> 00:19:50,705
有时候 不管你多努力去做正确的事情
Sometimes,no matter how
hard you try to do the right thing,

435
00:19:50,753 --> 00:19:52,556
最终也以摔倒结束
you just end up flat on your back,

436
00:19:52,604 --> 00:19:54,915
摔倒在一堆马屎上
flailing around in a
big pile of horse crap.

437
00:19:54,972 --> 00:19:58,118
- 你看到了?
- 我的电话现在能上网
- You saw it?
- My phone gets the internet now.

438
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,993
没关系
Is OK

439
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,457
这就是我和Natalie故事的结局
And that's how it ended with natalie.

440
00:20:04,687 --> 00:20:05,886
没有永远幸福快乐
No happily ever after,

441
00:20:06,116 --> 00:20:07,238
只有伤害
just a whole lot of hurt.

442
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:08,514
就这样
Anjust like that,

443
00:20:08,696 --> 00:20:10,825
所有的愉快回忆被取代...
all those wonderful
memories were replaced...

444
00:20:11,161 --> 00:20:12,120
被这些伤害取代
by this one.

445
00:20:12,446 --> 00:20:13,060
但是 你知道吗
But,you kw,

446
00:20:13,156 --> 00:20:14,345
那个晚上太糟糕了
bad as that night was,

447
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:16,244
不到一年
Natalie就结婚了
within a year,
natalie was married.

448
00:20:16,484 --> 00:20:18,584
现在她有3个美丽的小孩
And now she has three beautiful children.

449
00:20:18,891 --> 00:20:20,329
这是受伤害的积极的一面
So that's the upside of hurt.

450
00:20:20,627 --> 00:20:22,391
有时候因为某些原因而发生
Sometimes it happens for a reason.

451
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,733
你被一个女生痛揍了?
So you got beat up by a girl?

452
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:30,083
这就是你从这个故事里学到的吗?
Is that all you're
taking away from this story?

453
00:20:30,265 --> 00:20:32,634
你被一个女生痛揍了
You got beat up by a girl.

454
00:20:33,286 --> 00:20:35,233
嘿 她学过Krav Maga
Hey,she knew krav maga.
