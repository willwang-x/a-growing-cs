老爸老妈浪漫史 第一季 第十六集
How.I.Met.Your.Mother
Season 01 Episode 16

4
00:00:12,764 --> 00:00:14,683
孩子们，说到爱情
kids,when it comes to love,

5
00:00:14,683 --> 00:00:17,847
最好的一对是顺其自然的一对
the best relationships are the ones
that just come naturally.

6
00:00:17,847 --> 00:00:19,957
独立完成的作品
My first solo batch.

7
00:00:19,957 --> 00:00:22,451
嗯，我觉得还应该烤久一点
En,I think those need to stay in the
oven a while longer.

8
00:00:22,451 --> 00:00:23,793
给你一条专业建议
Here's a professional tip.

9
00:00:23,793 --> 00:00:26,862
还是液状的，这可不是纸托蛋糕
If it's still runny,it's not a cupcake.

10
00:00:26,862 --> 00:00:28,589
这是种饮料
It's a beverage.

11
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:30,315
哦，好的，和Victoria在一起的时光是快乐的……
Yeah,well,Things with Victoria were fun,

12
00:00:30,315 --> 00:00:31,466
轻松的……
and easy,

13
00:00:31,466 --> 00:00:33,288
也是毫不繁复的
and uncomplicated.

14
00:00:33,288 --> 00:00:34,918
非常甜蜜
It was pretty great.

15
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:43,166
你在涂你的屁股？
are you coloring in your butt?

16
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:44,509
我有个重要的面试
I have a big interview coming up,

17
00:00:44,509 --> 00:00:46,235
但我的西裤上有个破洞
and my suit has holes in it.

18
00:00:46,235 --> 00:00:49,208
我不会缝纫，也没有一条海军蓝内裤
所以……
I can't sew,I don't own navy boxers,so,yeah

19
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:51,414
我只好涂我的屁股
I'm coloring in my butt.

20
00:00:51,414 --> 00:00:52,277
那就穿条别的西裤
So wear another one.

21
00:00:52,277 --> 00:00:53,236
我没有另一条了
I don't have another one.

22
00:00:53,236 --> 00:00:54,195
我穷死了
I'm flat broke.

23
00:00:54,195 --> 00:00:57,168
我剩下的选择就只有运动服和光屁股了
（英语中suit指西服，但tracksuit指运动装
birthday suit指裸体）
My only other suit options are track or birthday.

24
00:00:57,935 --> 00:01:00,045
伙计，你要穿着这个去面试
Dude,you show up to an interview in that,

25
00:01:00,045 --> 00:01:02,922
即使是Granola公司招收素食主义嬉皮士律师
（职业嬉皮原则上是素食主义者）
even the hippie lawyers from Granola
Mountain Earth Pals

26
00:01:02,922 --> 00:01:04,840
也会直接把你炒鱿鱼的
will hackey sack you straight out the door.

27
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,238
好吧，是国家资源保护委员会
Okay,it's the National Resource Defense Council,

28
00:01:07,238 --> 00:01:08,964
是我梦想中的职业
and it's my dream job.

29
00:01:08,964 --> 00:01:10,786
不过还只是实习而已
Except it's only an internship,

30
00:01:10,786 --> 00:01:11,650
没有工资的
and I won't be getting paid.

31
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,280
大部分时间就是给人倒咖啡
Mostly getting people coffee.

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,102
但那些我送咖啡的人
But the people I'm getting coffee for

33
00:01:15,102 --> 00:01:18,171
他们的老板正在拯救世界
their bosses are going to save the world.

34
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,185
好吧，明天……
Okay,tomorrow......

35
00:01:20,185 --> 00:01:21,719
我先告诉你这将震动你的世界
and I should mention this is gonna
rock your world

36
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:26,227
明天我带你去见我的私人裁缝
tomorrow I'm taking you to my personal tailor.

37
00:01:26,227 --> 00:01:26,898
裁缝？
A tailor?

38
00:01:26,898 --> 00:01:29,488
Barney，我每周赚负300美元
Barney,I make negative $300 a week,

39
00:01:29,488 --> 00:01:31,598
而且我要省下这些负收入准备我的婚事
and I need every negative penny of
that for my wedding.

40
00:01:31,598 --> 00:01:33,707
放心，那个人只收三分之一的费用
Relax,my guy does everything for
one-third the cost.

41
00:01:33,707 --> 00:01:39,462
而且你也不可能穿着这个“反讽双引号”的“西服”去结婚
And there is no way you're getting married in that sarcastic- quotation-marks "suit."

42
00:01:39,462 --> 00:01:42,914
明天，中午，我的裁缝
Tomorrow,noon,my tailor.

43
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,120
谢谢不用了，伙计
No thanks,dude.

44
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,532
-中午？
-中午
-Noon?
-Noon.

45
00:01:49,532 --> 00:01:50,874
-好吧
-到时候见
-Okay.
-See you then.

46
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:56,533
嘿，姑娘们
Hey,girls.

47
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,588
我正要去见Ted
I'm on my way to meet Ted.

48
00:01:57,588 --> 00:01:58,642
是我们两个月纪念日
It's our two-month-iversary,

49
00:01:58,642 --> 00:01:59,889
所以我们要共进晚餐
so we're going out to dinner.

50
00:01:59,889 --> 00:02:02,383
棒极了！你回答了我所有要问的问题
Great!that answers all the questions I didn't ask.

51
00:02:02,383 --> 00:02:03,534
Robin！
Robin!

52
00:02:03,534 --> 00:02:04,205
哦，得了吧
Oh,come on.

53
00:02:04,205 --> 00:02:05,260
我们相互拆台
We bust on each other.

54
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,466
正说明我们有着亲密的友谊
We're just at that place in our strong friendship.

55
00:02:07,466 --> 00:02:08,904
真的？
Really?

56
00:02:09,384 --> 00:02:11,014
别碰我
Get off me.

57
00:02:11,206 --> 00:02:13,699
哦，看见没有？我又这么做了
Oh,see? I did it again.

58
00:02:15,138 --> 00:02:16,193
你们在干什么？
what are you guys up to?

59
00:02:16,193 --> 00:02:17,344
哦，挑婚纱
Oh,dress shopping.

60
00:02:17,344 --> 00:02:19,645
我给很多婚纱店做过蛋糕
You know,I make wedding cakes for
a lot of fancy bridal shops.

61
00:02:19,645 --> 00:02:20,892
你愿意的话，我可以带你去啊
If you want,I could take you shopping,

62
00:02:20,892 --> 00:02:22,427
也许还有优惠
maybe get you a discount.

63
00:02:22,427 --> 00:02:24,441
真的？那太好了
Really? That'd be great.

64
00:02:27,797 --> 00:02:29,236
我该接这个
I should take this.

65
00:02:29,811 --> 00:02:31,346
喂
Hello.

66
00:02:31,346 --> 00:02:32,688
嘿，我以为明天就我们两个人呢
Hey,I thought it was going to be just us tomorrow.

67
00:02:32,688 --> 00:02:34,990
怎么又邀请Punky Brewster了？
（Punky Brewster是一情景喜剧女主人翁）
What's with inviting Punky Brewster?

68
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:38,251
Robin，你应该想开些
Ted和Victoria在一起了
Robin,you've gotto get over this Ted and Victoria thing.

69
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:40,457
你本可以有机会的,但现在他已经向前看了
You had your chance,and now he's moved on.

70
00:02:40,457 --> 00:02:42,854
你就不能为他们感到高兴吗？
Can't you just be happy for them?

71
00:02:42,854 --> 00:02:44,868
我最多只能回应你一个假微笑和一双死鱼眼
The best I can give you is a fake smile and dead eyes.

72
00:02:44,868 --> 00:02:46,403
接受
Sold.

73
00:02:50,047 --> 00:02:51,869
Victoria，怎么了？
Victoria,what's wrong?

74
00:02:51,869 --> 00:02:54,649
我刚收到来自一家烹饪学会的奖学金邀请
I've just been offered a fellowship at
a culinary institute 

75
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,829
……在德国
......in Germany.

76
00:02:56,089 --> 00:02:58,391
等等，德国，欧洲？
Wait. Germany,Europe?

77
00:02:58,391 --> 00:02:59,829
要去两年
It's for two years.

78
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:01,555
我原意为我的机会不大
I figured I didn't have much of a chance,

79
00:03:01,555 --> 00:03:04,241
因为他们通常不招收美国人，但……
cause they don't let many Americans in,but...

80
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:05,583
我录取了
I'm in.

81
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,981
嗯，是那个欧洲的德国？
So,this is the Europe Germany?

82
00:03:07,981 --> 00:03:09,995
还会有哪个德国？
What other Germany would it be?

83
00:03:09,995 --> 00:03:11,050
Epcot里面那个？
（迪士尼公园的Epcot分园
有各国民俗风景区）
The one in Epcot?

84
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:11,817
Ted
Ted.

85
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:13,256
对不起
sorry

86
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:15,653
祝贺你
Congratulations.

87
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,284
谢谢
Thank you.

88
00:03:17,284 --> 00:03:19,010
我还不确定要不要去
I don't know if I'm going to go.

89
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:21,791
而且如果你去了的话我们这又算什么？
And if-if you do,what does that mean for us?

90
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:22,942
我不知道
I don't know.

91
00:03:24,285 --> 00:03:24,860
我只是……
I just......

92
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,833
我不认为异地恋会有好的结果
I don't think that long distance really
works for anyone.

93
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:28,984
哦，天啊，当然了
Oh,god,no.

94
00:03:28,984 --> 00:03:33,492
异地恋是高中生在上大学前为了上床而讲的骗话
Long-distance is a lie teenagers tell each other to get laid the summer before college.

95
00:03:34,546 --> 00:03:37,040
所以，我们选择只有……
So,that leaves us with...

96
00:03:37,328 --> 00:03:39,342
要么你留在这儿
either you stay here,

97
00:03:39,342 --> 00:03:40,972
要么我们分手
or we break up.

98
00:03:45,096 --> 00:03:46,343
听着，我们顺其自然好么
look,let's just see how things progress,

99
00:03:46,343 --> 00:03:47,494
如果到9月份，我们对彼此还有……
and if by September,we still feel...

100
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:48,836
我周一就要离开了
I have to leave on Monday

101
00:03:48,836 --> 00:03:50,179
9月份第几个周一？
Monday,September the...?

102
00:03:50,179 --> 00:03:51,138
Ted
Ted.

103
00:03:53,823 --> 00:03:55,549
你有什么看法？
Do you have any thoughts?

104
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:59,290
真希望我们能有多点时间思考我们真正要什么
Maybe we should each take some time to think about what we want.

105
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:01,975
我们明天再见面讨论吧
We'll meet up tomorrow to discuss it.

106
00:04:02,455 --> 00:04:03,989
就这么定了
It's a date.

107
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:06,866
而从这里，事情开始一发不可收拾
And that's when things got complicated.

108
00:04:08,401 --> 00:04:09,935
嘿，宝贝，婚纱店怎么样？
Hey,baby,how's the dress place?

109
00:04:09,935 --> 00:04:11,949
这里一切都是蓬蓬的，白白的
Everything's so fluffy and white.

110
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:13,771
好像在一团棉花糖里买东西一样
It's like shopping in a marshmallow.

111
00:04:13,771 --> 00:04:15,689
Barney的裁缝怎么样？
How's Barney's tailor?

112
00:04:16,936 --> 00:04:20,868
这里的一切都暗暗的，乱糟糟的,看起来好像非法的
everything here is dark and sketchy 
and seems illegal.

113
00:04:20,868 --> 00:04:23,074
好像在Barney的脑子里买东西一样
It's like shopping in Barney's mind.

114
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:25,280
-祝你好运，宝贝
-再见
-good luck,baby.
-Bye.

115
00:04:26,718 --> 00:04:27,965
嘿，Barney
Hey,Barney,

116
00:04:27,965 --> 00:04:29,404
我心里有点发怵
I'm not sure about this.

117
00:04:29,404 --> 00:04:31,801
住在宠物店后面的裁缝？
A tailor in the back room of a pet store?

118
00:04:31,801 --> 00:04:34,870
听着，你还想不想要一套好西装另附送一只兔子了？
Look,do you want a quality suit and
a free rabbit or not?

119
00:04:40,049 --> 00:04:41,775
Ted，Sergei说别在这儿唉声叹气了
Ted,Sergei says stop moping around.

120
00:04:41,775 --> 00:04:43,693
你打扰到他工作了
You're distracting him from his process.

121
00:04:43,693 --> 00:04:45,420
你会说乌克兰语？
You speak ukrainian?

122
00:04:46,762 --> 00:04:48,872
伙计们，我现在进退两难了
Guys,I'm kind of screwed here.

123
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,023
我不想失去Victoria
I don't want to lose Victoria,

124
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:52,708
但我也不想只因为我让她留下
but I can't ask her to stay just for me.

125
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,722
而且又不可能异地恋
And long distance definitely isn't an option.

126
00:04:54,722 --> 00:04:56,544
不，不，不可能
No. No,no,no. No way.

127
00:04:56,544 --> 00:04:57,983
你知道谁喜欢异地恋吗？
You know who likes long distance?

128
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,997
女孩儿们，只有聊天没有性生活
Girls. It's all talking and no sex.

129
00:04:59,997 --> 00:05:01,531
杀了我吧
Kill me now.

130
00:05:01,531 --> 00:05:03,737
别诋毁异地恋
Don't knock long-distance relationships.

131
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:05,272
我认为是可行的
I really think they can work.

132
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:06,327
真的？你？
Really? You?

133
00:05:06,327 --> 00:05:06,998
那当然
Absolutely.

134
00:05:06,998 --> 00:05:08,724
我现处于四段异地恋中
I'm juggling four right now.

135
00:05:08,724 --> 00:05:10,067
马德里的Lisa
There's lisa in Madrid,

136
00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:11,793
东京的Erica
there's Erica in Tokyo,

137
00:05:11,793 --> 00:05:13,519
丹麦的Laura
there's Laura in Denmark,

138
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:16,013
还有34号大街的Kelly
and Kelly on 34th street.

139
00:05:16,301 --> 00:05:19,945
最后那个以为我是基尔拉尼的牧羊人
The lass thinks I'm a humble sheep
shearer from Killarney.

140
00:05:20,616 --> 00:05:24,932
Ted，你还记得大学时候Lily到巴黎去进修暑假艺术课程
Ted,do you remember in college when Lily
did that summer art program in Paris?

141
00:05:24,932 --> 00:05:28,193
她一直提起一个法国男生，Gabriel
she kept talking about this cheesy French guy,Gabriel.

142
00:05:28,193 --> 00:05:29,248
于是我就到那边去了
So,I went out to visit,

143
00:05:29,248 --> 00:05:30,207
正好有个派对
and there was this party.

144
00:05:30,207 --> 00:05:32,125
那个Gabriel也去了
And who shows up but Gabriel.

145
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:35,481
他留着两撇俗气的法国小胡子
And he's got this weak-ass,thin French moustache.

146
00:05:35,481 --> 00:05:36,536
我不是惹事生非的人
Yet I'm not much of a fighter,

147
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,934
但我知道我能搞定这个小怪胎
but I knew I could take this weird little dude.

148
00:05:38,934 --> 00:05:40,468
所以我把他叫到一边
So,I took him aside,

149
00:05:40,468 --> 00:05:41,811
保持沉默
and I got all creepy quiet,

150
00:05:41,811 --> 00:05:43,633
杀人的眼神
I got the crazy eyes going,

151
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:44,880
然后我说
and I said,

152
00:05:45,743 --> 00:05:47,757
你离Lily远点儿
"you stay away from Lily,

153
00:05:48,141 --> 00:05:54,087
否则我就把你的胡子从你恶心的法国脸上咬下来
or I swear to god I'll eat that moustache
right off of your ugly French face."

154
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,525
是的，然后他逃跑了
Yeah,then he literally ran away.

155
00:05:55,525 --> 00:05:57,348
我想他哭了
I think he was crying.

156
00:05:57,348 --> 00:05:59,170
我从来没有告诉Lily
I never told Lily about it.

157
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,184
说实话，我不为此感到骄傲
To be honest,I'm not very proud of it.

158
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:05,020
说真正的实话，我很骄傲
To be even more honest,I am.

159
00:06:06,362 --> 00:06:08,856
除了向欧洲人展示美国人的一贯风貌以外
other than confirming a lot of European
stereotypes about Americans,

160
00:06:08,856 --> 00:06:11,158
这个故事还有什么意义吗？
did that little story have a point?

161
00:06:11,158 --> 00:06:13,268
是的，意义就是，尽管Lily是我终生心灵伴侣
Yeah,the point is that even though Lily
is my soul mate,

162
00:06:13,268 --> 00:06:15,282
异地恋几乎断送了我们
long distance still almost killed us.

163
00:06:15,282 --> 00:06:19,022
如果你认为有可能
Victoria就是那一半的话
If you think that there's any chance
that Victoria is your soul mate,

164
00:06:19,022 --> 00:06:20,460
你应该让她留下
you should ask her to stay.

165
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,707
但是，我就是不知道，一切都太早了
But,I don't know if she is. It's still so early,

166
00:06:21,707 --> 00:06:23,050
不过，她有可能就是啊
but yeah,she could be.

167
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,968
哦，得了吧，你都不了解她
Oh,please.You barely know this girl.

168
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:25,927
她最喜欢的颜色是什么？
What's her favorite color?

169
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,557
她喜欢猫还是喜欢狗？
Is she a cat person or a dog person?

170
00:06:27,557 --> 00:06:29,571
她乐不乐意三人行？
Is she open to a three-way?

171
00:06:29,571 --> 00:06:32,352
Ted，我买部手机做的研究都比你足
Ted,I do more research than this before
buying a cell phone.

172
00:06:32,352 --> 00:06:36,093
另外仅供参考，我的手机支持“三方通话”
And FYI,yes,I have three-way calling.

173
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:37,819
听着，她不可能喜欢猫
Look,she can't be a cat person.

174
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:40,600
我是喜欢狗的人,爱狗者物以类聚
I'm a dog person,I'm attracted
to other dog people.

175
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,422
你确定？
Are you sure?

176
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:46,738
喂
hello.

177
00:06:46,738 --> 00:06:47,409
嘿，随机问题
Hey,random question.

178
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:48,752
你喜欢猫吗？
How do you feel about cats?

179
00:06:48,752 --> 00:06:49,423
猫？
Cats.

180
00:06:49,423 --> 00:06:51,725
讨厌那部歌剧，喜欢那种动物
（一著名歌剧名为《猫》）
Hated the musical,love the animal.

181
00:06:52,301 --> 00:06:53,643
了解
Good to know.

182
00:06:53,643 --> 00:06:54,219
好的
okay.

183
00:06:54,219 --> 00:06:55,657
再见
Good-bye.

184
00:06:56,424 --> 00:06:57,767
她喜欢猫
She's a cat person.

185
00:06:58,342 --> 00:07:00,644
我根本不了解这女孩儿
I don't know this girl at all.

186
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:02,562
棒极了
excellent.

187
00:07:02,562 --> 00:07:04,193
我们选这个
We'll take this one.

188
00:07:04,576 --> 00:07:06,398
这是我的西装不该由我来选吗？
it's my suit.Shouldn't I be the one to choose?

189
00:07:07,453 --> 00:07:09,851
乖，给你个针垫玩儿
here. Play with this pin cushion.

190
00:07:16,181 --> 00:07:17,715
上帝啊
God.

191
00:07:17,715 --> 00:07:19,537
我看起来帅呆了
I'm going to look hot.

192
00:07:19,537 --> 00:07:23,182
Marshall，我可不能让你穿着这样的行头去打败仗
Marshall,I can't let you waste a suit this
nice fighting a losing battle

193
00:07:23,182 --> 00:07:24,428
就什么狗屁资源保护
for our planet's survival.

194
00:07:24,428 --> 00:07:25,867
这是强者的西装
This is a suit for winners.

195
00:07:25,867 --> 00:07:28,073
我给你安排个面试,到我们公司来
I am getting you an interview at my office.

196
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,895
我们的法律分部需要像你这样优秀的人才
We need good men like you in our legal department.

197
00:07:29,895 --> 00:07:32,868
我们经常吃官司
We get sued a lot.

198
00:07:32,868 --> 00:07:33,731
不行
No way.

199
00:07:33,731 --> 00:07:35,361
我不卖第二家
The kid does not sell out.

200
00:07:35,361 --> 00:07:36,608
来嘛，伙计
come on,dude!

201
00:07:36,608 --> 00:07:37,855
三个月跟我工作
Three months working with me,

202
00:07:37,855 --> 00:07:39,965
比Lily一年赚的还多
you'll make more than Lily makes in a year.

203
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,691
不
No.

204
00:07:41,691 --> 00:07:43,513
我意已决
I've made my decision.

205
00:07:43,513 --> 00:07:45,048
我也是
So have I.

206
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,678
如果我要求一个女生为了我而放弃梦想
If I ask this girl to give up her dreams for me,

207
00:07:46,678 --> 00:07:47,925
如果两个星期后我们又没能在一起
and two weeks later,it's not working out,

208
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:50,418
我不是成了一个大混球了吗？
I'm,like,the biggest jerk of all time.

209
00:07:50,418 --> 00:07:53,391
只能说这对一段刚起步的恋情而言太过强求了
It's just too much pressure on a new relationship.

210
00:07:54,254 --> 00:07:56,077
我会让她走的
I'm going to tell her to go.

211
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:00,488
于是我那天晚上与她见面并告诉她我的决定
And so I met her that night to
tell her my decision.

212
00:08:00,488 --> 00:08:02,790
好吧，我考虑了很久……
All right,I've been thinking a lot about this...

213
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,900
嗯，在你说出来之前
okay,before you say anything,

214
00:08:05,475 --> 00:08:08,736
我先给你这个
I wanted to give you this.

215
00:08:09,311 --> 00:08:11,038
这个才是……
This is what happens when you,

216
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:13,531
烤熟的成品
you know,let them finish baking.

217
00:08:20,436 --> 00:08:22,163
我想要你留下来
I want you to stay.

218
00:08:25,876 --> 00:08:29,904
这里的一切都暗暗的，乱糟糟的,看起来好像非法的
Everything here is darkand sketchy,
and seems illegal.

219
00:08:29,904 --> 00:08:31,918
好像在Barney的脑子里买东西一样
It's like shopping in Barney's mind.

220
00:08:32,493 --> 00:08:34,507
-祝你好运，宝贝
-再见
-good luck,baby.
-Bye.

221
00:08:34,699 --> 00:08:37,385
那么，你想要件什么样式的？
Now,what sort of dress did you have in mind,dear?

222
00:08:37,385 --> 00:08:39,782
不要太雍容或者太华丽
Nothing too huge or-or poofy.

223
00:08:39,782 --> 00:08:41,221
我不是很爱花俏
I'm not really a girlie girl.

224
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:44,002
不过我还是希望能象个漂亮的公主
But I would like to look like a 
beautiful princess.

225
00:08:44,002 --> 00:08:45,728
我看见店前面有几套不错的
I saw a couple up front that were nice.

226
00:08:45,728 --> 00:08:47,263
橱窗里的？
By the window?

227
00:08:47,454 --> 00:08:48,318
恕我冒犯，亲爱的
No offense,dear,

228
00:08:48,318 --> 00:08:51,099
那些都在你能承受的范围之外
but those are a little out of your price range.

229
00:08:52,825 --> 00:08:53,976
她这话从哪儿来？
Where does she get off?

230
00:08:53,976 --> 00:08:55,798
她又不知道我的收入是多少
She doesn't know how much money I make.

231
00:08:55,798 --> 00:08:57,141
哦，这些女人都是行家
Oh,these women are experts.

232
00:08:57,141 --> 00:09:00,497
她们看看你的内衣就可以知道你的年收入是多少
They can guess your net annual income just
by looking at your underwear.

233
00:09:00,497 --> 00:09:04,525
该死的老式海军短裤和廉价三点式
Damn you,old navy and your reasonably-priced
three-packs!

234
00:09:04,813 --> 00:09:06,156
至少我们有免费的香槟！
At least we get free champagne!

235
00:09:06,156 --> 00:09:07,690
还有蛋糕
And cake.

236
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,129
说起来，Victoria
Speaking of which,Victoria,

237
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:12,581
关于甜甜圈奖学金的问题,你考虑好了没有？
have you decided what to do about your doughnut fellowship?

238
00:09:12,581 --> 00:09:14,212
嗯，我也不清楚
You know,I don't know.

239
00:09:14,212 --> 00:09:15,075
我是说，我是想去
I mean,I want to go,

240
00:09:15,075 --> 00:09:16,705
但我也不想失去Ted
but I don't want to lose Ted.

241
00:09:16,705 --> 00:09:17,952
我想过异地恋的可能
I even thought about long distance,

242
00:09:17,952 --> 00:09:19,486
如果能行的话
as if that ever works.

243
00:09:19,486 --> 00:09:22,459
光聊天没性生活？杀了我吧
All talking and no sex.Kill me now.

244
00:09:22,939 --> 00:09:24,761
我知道这听起来也许比较土
I know it sounds lame,

245
00:09:24,761 --> 00:09:27,638
但我想Ted有可能就是我的真命天子
but I actually think that Ted might be the one.

246
00:09:27,638 --> 00:09:29,460
很难说离开就离开
That's pretty hard to walk away from.

247
00:09:29,556 --> 00:09:30,707
我不知道
I don't know.

248
00:09:30,707 --> 00:09:33,392
我觉得要是为了爱情拒绝事业就有点像《复制娇妻》了
I'd feel a little stepford turning down
a huge opportunity

249
00:09:33,392 --> 00:09:35,598
就为了和一个刚认识没两个月的男人
to chase some guy I'd only known two months.

250
00:09:35,598 --> 00:09:37,708
但这不是随便哪个男的
But this isn't just some guy.

251
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,147
这可是Ted
This is Ted.

252
00:09:39,147 --> 00:09:40,393
他棒极了
He's amazing.

253
00:09:40,393 --> 00:09:42,791
他是我认识的最好的男人
He's the best guy I know.

254
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,189
美国最好的，但是德国男人？
in America,but German guys?

255
00:09:45,189 --> 00:09:47,394
我愿意让他们每天给我的干果片撒上面包屑
I would let them bread my schnitz any day,

256
00:09:47,394 --> 00:09:48,353
明白我的意思吗？
if you know what I mean.

257
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,518
-说实话，不是很明白
-性爱
-I really don't...
-sex.

258
00:09:52,861 --> 00:09:53,916
对不起，女士
Excuse me,ma'am.

259
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,259
这瓶搞定了
This bastard's kicked.

260
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:56,314
谢谢
Thanks.

261
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,684
没关系，伙计们,我讨厌这套
It's okay,guys,I hate it.

262
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,602
-糟糕透了
-很丑，真的很丑
-Just horrible.
-It's bad,it's really bad.

263
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:05,328
前短，后长？
Short in front,long in the back?

264
00:10:05,328 --> 00:10:07,822
这是婚纱中的Mullet
（一种发型，前短后长）
That is the Mullet of wedding dresses.

265
00:10:09,069 --> 00:10:12,425
要知道，Victoria，Marshall和我曾经有过异地恋
You know,Victoria,Marshall and I did long distance once.

266
00:10:12,425 --> 00:10:15,303
大学的时候，我到巴黎去进修
In college,I did an art course in Paris.

267
00:10:15,303 --> 00:10:17,316
我是那儿唯一的美国人
I was the only American there.

268
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:18,659
非常的孤单
It was really lonely.

269
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,440
我只有一个朋友，Gabrielle
I only had one friend,Gabrielle.

270
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,030
她长得有点怪
She was kind of homely and strange-looking,

271
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:27,770
她还很在意她嘴唇上的两撇小胡子
and she was really self-conscious about
this little moustache she had.

272
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,209
后来，学期刚过一半的时候
Anyway,halfway through the semester,

273
00:10:29,209 --> 00:10:30,839
她忽然不理我了
she just stopped talking to me,

274
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,757
我一直没弄明白为什么
and I never figured out why.

275
00:10:33,908 --> 00:10:35,634
然后我又成孤单一人了
And then I had nobody.

276
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,648
唯一让我坚持过来的信念是
The only thing that got me through was knowing that

277
00:10:37,648 --> 00:10:40,429
我的心灵伴侣还在家乡等我回去
my soul mate was back at home waiting for me.

278
00:10:41,101 --> 00:10:42,252
如果Ted是你的心灵伴侣
If Ted's your soul mate,

279
00:10:42,252 --> 00:10:45,129
也许这就值得你留下
then it may be worth it to hang onto him.

280
00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:47,239
但我如何才能知道他是不是呢？
But how am I supposed to know if we're soul mates?

281
00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:49,061
这一切都太早了
It's too soon.

282
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,075
说曹操，曹操到
Speak of the devil.

283
00:10:51,075 --> 00:10:51,650
喂
Hello.

284
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,952
嘿，随机问题：你喜欢猫吗？
Hey,random question: How do you feel cats?

285
00:10:53,952 --> 00:10:56,637
猫，讨厌歌剧，喜欢动物
Cats. Hated the musical,love the animal.

286
00:10:56,637 --> 00:10:57,596
喜欢猫的人
A cat person.

287
00:10:57,596 --> 00:10:59,610
真是不出意料啊
Why am I not surprised?

288
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:02,104
拜
Bye.

289
00:11:02,104 --> 00:11:04,022
为什么Ted想知道我喜不喜欢猫？
Why does Ted want to know if I like cats?

290
00:11:04,022 --> 00:11:06,228
也许他想送你一只
Maybe he's going buy you one.

291
00:11:06,228 --> 00:11:08,529
我的确听到电话里有狗叫声
I did hear barking in the background.

292
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:10,256
也许他正在一家宠物店里
Maybe he was in a pet store.

293
00:11:10,256 --> 00:11:12,174
他想让我们一起养只猫吗？
Does he want us to get a cat together?

294
00:11:12,174 --> 00:11:15,914
也许他想用可爱的猫咪引诱你留下
Maybe he's using an adorable kitty to guilt you into staying.

295
00:11:16,202 --> 00:11:17,832
这招很低劣
that is low.

296
00:11:18,599 --> 00:11:19,942
你真这么认为？
Do you really think that's what he's doing?

297
00:11:19,942 --> 00:11:21,284
我都不会等等看是不是真的
I wouldn't even wait to find out.

298
00:11:21,284 --> 00:11:23,586
我立马坐下一班飞机去德国
I would be on the next plane to Germany.

299
00:11:27,326 --> 00:11:29,436
哦，天啊，你们真不会撒谎
Oh,god,you guys are sucky liars.

300
00:11:29,436 --> 00:11:32,218
-丑死了，丑死了
-我无语了
-Ugly,ugly,ugly.
-I don't know what to say.

301
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:33,656
知道吗
You know what?

302
00:11:33,656 --> 00:11:35,095
我们不敢这么找
We're doing this all wrong.

303
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:39,890
我去帮你那件橱窗里的婚纱，就试穿而已
I am going to get you one of those
front window dresses,just for fun.

304
00:11:42,096 --> 00:11:43,246
你还好吗？
Are you okay?

305
00:11:43,246 --> 00:11:44,589
我很好
I'm fine.

306
00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:45,644
好吧
Okay.

307
00:11:45,644 --> 00:11:49,001
只是看起来你恨不得马上让Victoria出国去
Just kind of seemed like you're trying to
hustle Victoria out of the country.

308
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:51,015
没有啊，我只是在支持她
I'm not,I'm just trying to support her.

309
00:11:51,015 --> 00:11:53,988
她获得了一个超级重要的甜点奖学金
She got a super-important dessert scholarship.

310
00:11:53,988 --> 00:11:55,330
别说得这么讽刺
stop being sarcastic.

311
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:58,016
那本就是个超级重要的甜点奖学金
It is a super-important dessert scholarship.

312
00:11:58,016 --> 00:12:00,989
谁说出口都显得讽刺
that's hard to say without sounding sarcastic.

313
00:12:01,564 --> 00:12:02,619
听着……
Look...

314
00:12:02,619 --> 00:12:04,729
我知道你不怎么喜欢Victoria
I know you're not Victoria's biggest fan,

315
00:12:04,729 --> 00:12:07,702
但Ted和她在一起很开心
but she seems to make Ted happy.

316
00:12:08,086 --> 00:12:12,401
所以在你用自己的航空附赠里程为她买机票前好好想想吧
So think about that before you use your
miles to buy her a plane ticket.

317
00:12:12,593 --> 00:12:14,415
有人想当“漂亮公主”
Somebody say "beautiful princess."

318
00:12:14,415 --> 00:12:17,484
哦，我的天啊，太完美了
Oh,my gosh,it's perfect!

319
00:12:17,484 --> 00:12:21,033
穿上这条裙子，我的新婚之夜一定彻夜难眠
This dress is totally going to get me
laid on my wedding night.

320
00:12:22,663 --> 00:12:25,348
哦，瞧她多幸福啊
oh,look how happy she is.

321
00:12:25,348 --> 00:12:27,650
要知道，我曾以为自己是那种……
You know,I've always thought of myself
as one of those

322
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:31,486
独立的女人，不会让感情破坏自己的事业
independent women who would never let
any guy mess with my career.

323
00:12:31,486 --> 00:12:33,884
而现在我却真的这么考虑了
And now I'm actually thinking about it.

324
00:12:33,884 --> 00:12:34,747
我感到内疚
I feel guilty,

325
00:12:34,747 --> 00:12:38,199
好像有点太小女人了
like it's un-feminist or something.

326
00:12:39,254 --> 00:12:40,981
我明白你的意思
I know what you mean.

327
00:12:40,981 --> 00:12:42,227
真的？
You do?

328
00:12:44,146 --> 00:12:48,653
我总是把事业放第一感情第二，然而……
I'm always putting my career ahead
of my relationships,and...

329
00:12:48,845 --> 00:12:52,106
说实话，我这样的工作总是带来不少孤独的夜晚
to be honest,there's a lot of lonely
nights in that job description.

330
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:54,311
瞧，我就是害怕这样
See,that's what I'm afraid of.

331
00:12:54,311 --> 00:12:59,298
选择Ted而不是事业并不是说明你小女人
Choosing Ted over your career doesn't
make you un-feminist.

332
00:13:00,066 --> 00:13:03,326
也许这意味着你们在一起会很幸福
Maybe it just means that you guys would be happy together.

333
00:13:04,477 --> 00:13:06,108
Robin...
Robin...

334
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:10,231
我觉得你是最酷的
I think that you are the coolest.

335
00:13:10,231 --> 00:13:12,341
我很高兴我们是朋友
I'm so glad that we're friends.

336
00:13:12,341 --> 00:13:12,917
不可能……
no way......

337
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:13,876
你才是最酷的
you're the coolest.

338
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,082
不，你才是
No,you are.

339
00:13:16,082 --> 00:13:17,712
好吧，我是
Okay,I am.

340
00:13:21,644 --> 00:13:23,274
我打算留下来
I'm going to stay.

341
00:13:31,618 --> 00:13:33,536
我真是太美了
I am so beautiful!

342
00:13:33,536 --> 00:13:34,879
别告诉我要花多少钱
don't tell me how much it costs.

343
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:35,934
就这样砍我的头吧
Just snap my neck now,

344
00:13:35,934 --> 00:13:37,852
我就可以死得其美
so I can die this pretty.

345
00:13:38,523 --> 00:13:41,017
你看起来美极了
you look incredible.

346
00:13:41,017 --> 00:13:42,263
好吧，好吧，这要多少钱？
Okay,okay,how much is it,

347
00:13:42,263 --> 00:13:44,565
是“永远不可能”还是“永远永远不可能”？
on a scale of never to never ever?

348
00:13:45,045 --> 00:13:47,442
永远永远永远……
Never ever,ever,ever,ever...

349
00:13:47,442 --> 00:13:49,264
无限时间……
times infinity.

350
00:13:51,566 --> 00:13:53,100
没关系
it's okay.

351
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,169
你知道，新娘之所以漂亮是因为……
You know,what makes a bride beautiful is that

352
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,951
她很开心就要嫁人了
she's just happy to be getting married.

353
00:14:02,307 --> 00:14:04,321
伙计们，我知道我看起来美极了
guys,I know I look amazing,

354
00:14:04,321 --> 00:14:08,733
但重要的是，Marshall和我彼此相爱，对不？
but the important thing is that
Marshall and I love each other,right?

355
00:14:08,733 --> 00:14:10,459
是的，没错
Yes,you're right.

356
00:14:10,939 --> 00:14:12,377
但顺便提一句
But also...

357
00:14:12,377 --> 00:14:14,967
你坐到蛋糕上了
you just sat down in the cake.

358
00:14:17,268 --> 00:14:17,940
没关系，要知道
but,you know what?

359
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,858
很容易洗的，只是些
It's going to come out because it's only...

360
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:21,968
巧克力和树莓
chocolate and raspberry.

361
00:14:21,968 --> 00:14:22,639
好吧
Okay.

362
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,845
来，站起来，看看有多糟
Come on,get up,let us see how bad it is.

363
00:14:33,188 --> 00:14:35,682
我找到的时候就是这样了
it was like this when I found it?

364
00:14:35,682 --> 00:14:37,888
你打算怎么赔？
And how will you be paying for this?

365
00:14:39,902 --> 00:14:42,107
信用卡……多张
credit card...s.

366
00:14:46,423 --> 00:14:48,149
我想给你……
I wanted to give you... ...

367
00:14:48,149 --> 00:14:49,684
这个
this.

368
00:14:50,067 --> 00:14:51,986
这个才是……
This is what happens when you...

369
00:14:51,986 --> 00:14:54,479
烤熟的成品
you know,let them finish baking.

370
00:15:01,096 --> 00:15:02,919
我想要你留下来
I want you to stay.

371
00:15:06,275 --> 00:15:07,234
我必须去德国
I have to go to Germany.

372
00:15:11,303 --> 00:15:12,645
你要走？
you're going?

373
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:13,412
是的
Yes.

374
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,755
我必须走
I have to.

375
00:15:14,755 --> 00:15:16,194
你真的这么决定了？
So that's what you decided?

376
00:15:16,194 --> 00:15:16,961
不是……
no......

377
00:15:16,961 --> 00:15:19,071
我本来打算留下来的
I mean,I actually came here tonight leaning toward staying,

378
00:15:19,071 --> 00:15:20,222
可听你说要我留下来
but when you just told me to stay,

379
00:15:20,222 --> 00:15:22,619
让我意识到我必须走
it made me realize that I have to go.

380
00:15:22,619 --> 00:15:24,250
什么意思，今天是反话节？
What is this,opposite day or something?

381
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:24,825
不是
No.

382
00:15:24,825 --> 00:15:26,551
意思是“是”？
So it is?

383
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,004
Ted，我们才相处两个月
Ted,we've only been dating for two months.

384
00:15:30,004 --> 00:15:32,306
我不能让你为我做决定
I can't let you make this decision for me.

385
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,840
我本来是想让你走的
I was totally going to tell you to go,

386
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,087
然后你又给我这个纸托蛋糕
but then you gave me this cupcake,

387
00:15:35,087 --> 00:15:37,005
让我想起来你有多么好
and it reminded me how great you are.

388
00:15:37,005 --> 00:15:39,978
有没有可能你愿意和我一起去德国？
is there any chance that you would move to Germany with me?

389
00:15:39,978 --> 00:15:41,896
那太疯狂
that's just crazy.

390
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:43,622
哦，好啊
Oh,okay.

391
00:15:43,622 --> 00:15:45,540
我为你做牺牲就行得通
So it's fine for me to make sacrifices for you,

392
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,403
要你来就太疯狂
but for you it's crazy.

393
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,034
但你留在这还有工作有生活
But you have a job here and a life;

394
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:48,897
我在那边一无所有
I'd have nothing there.

395
00:15:48,897 --> 00:15:49,472
你还有我啊
You'd have me.

396
00:15:49,472 --> 00:15:51,486
我们才相处两个月
We've only been dating two months.

397
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,268
哦，这不公平
Oh,it's not fair.

398
00:15:54,268 --> 00:15:56,090
我们必须分手，这真不公平
It's not fair that we have to break up.

399
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,241
我恨这样
I hate this.

400
00:16:00,214 --> 00:16:01,077
那么……
So...

401
00:16:02,036 --> 00:16:03,666
我们要分手了？
we're breaking up?

402
00:16:05,105 --> 00:16:06,735
我猜是吧
I guess so.

403
00:16:09,804 --> 00:16:11,338
我猜是吧
I guess so.

404
00:16:13,257 --> 00:16:15,366
老天，烂结局，伙计
God,that sucks,man.

405
00:16:15,366 --> 00:16:16,421
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

406
00:16:17,668 --> 00:16:19,011
只是压力太大也太早了
It was just too much pressure too soon.

407
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:22,080
我是说，也许这样想都太疯狂了……
I mean,maybe it was silly to even think...

408
00:16:22,463 --> 00:16:24,094
是的，Marshall,我看见你的新西服了
yes,Marshall,I see your new suit,

409
00:16:24,094 --> 00:16:25,340
棒极了
and it's awesome.

410
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,163
谢谢你的赞许
thank you for acknowledging it.

411
00:16:27,163 --> 00:16:28,218
奇怪，反应这么慢
It was weird that you hadn't.

412
00:16:28,218 --> 00:16:31,191
听着，我明白你们俩最后不得不分手
Look,I understand that you guys had to break up eventually,

413
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:32,246
但为什么要是今天
but why today?

414
00:16:32,246 --> 00:16:33,109
她明天就要走了
She's leaving tomorrow.

415
00:16:33,109 --> 00:16:34,835
但她还在这儿啊
but she's still in town.

416
00:16:34,835 --> 00:16:35,890
她……
she...

417
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,328
她还在这边
she's still in town.

418
00:16:37,328 --> 00:16:40,301
你们就多相处美好的一天啊
so you spend one more amazing day together.

419
00:16:40,301 --> 00:16:41,836
Ted，这样想
Ted,think about it this way:

420
00:16:41,836 --> 00:16:44,138
要是你知道明天你就要失去你的腿了
If you knew that you were going
to lose your leg tomorrow,

421
00:16:44,138 --> 00:16:46,152
你是坐在沙发上为此哭泣
would you sit on the couch and
cry about it,

422
00:16:46,152 --> 00:16:48,549
还是你会去跑，去跳
or would you run,and jump,

423
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:51,906
去做一些漂亮的凌空飞踢珍惜你的最后时光？
and do some awesome air kicks while you still could?

424
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,509
漂亮的凌空飞踢？
awesome air kicks?

425
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,290
新的睡裤？
New pajama bottoms?

426
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,537
终于发现了
You know it.

427
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,031
所以我们要么坐在原地哭泣
So we can sit around and cry,

428
00:17:03,031 --> 00:17:07,346
或者我们在腿被砍掉之前去跑，去做一些凌空飞踢
or we can run,and do awesome air kicks before our leg gets chopped off.

429
00:17:07,346 --> 00:17:09,360
等一下，这腿是我们共有的吗？
Wait,so we're sharing the leg?

430
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,566
不，这腿是个比喻
No,the leg is a metaphor.

431
00:17:11,566 --> 00:17:14,635
怎么可能这条腿今天还能做漂亮的凌空飞踢
How could the leg be well enough to
do awesome air kicks one day,

432
00:17:14,635 --> 00:17:17,800
但是却病得不行,必须被砍掉？
and yet still so sick it needs to be
chopped off the next?

433
00:17:19,526 --> 00:17:20,773
我不知道，Ted
I don't know,Ted.

434
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:22,499
来嘛，我们在一起很开心
Come on,we've had a good run.

435
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,417
为什么以一个吵架作结局？
Why end on a fight?

436
00:17:24,417 --> 00:17:25,856
你想怎么做？
what would you want to do?

437
00:17:25,856 --> 00:17:28,349
我们去完成那些以前谈到过却一直没实现的事情
Let's do all the stuff we talked about
doing and never got around to.

438
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:29,213
比如去MET？
（大都会艺术博物馆）
Like go to the MET.

439
00:17:29,213 --> 00:17:30,651
我们从布鲁克林大桥上走过去
we'll walk across the Brooklyn Bridge.

440
00:17:30,651 --> 00:17:32,186
看看动物园里的猴子？
See some monkeys at the zoo?

441
00:17:32,186 --> 00:17:35,830
去那个法国-越南式餐厅
我们每次路过都说要试试的
Go to that French-Vietnamese place
we keep passing and say we want to try?

442
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,748
哇，我们最好开始出发吧
Wow,we'd better get going.

443
00:17:38,419 --> 00:17:39,762
漫长的一天
big day.

444
00:17:39,762 --> 00:17:40,241
听我说，孩子们
And,kids,

445
00:17:40,241 --> 00:17:43,215
我们最后一天的确这么过了
that's exactly what we did with our last day.

446
00:17:43,215 --> 00:17:46,955
博物馆，大桥，餐厅
The museum,the bridge,the restaurant,

447
00:17:46,955 --> 00:17:49,736
所有一切美好的事情
and all of those nice things.

448
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,175
Lily，你必须告诉他
Lily,you have to tell him.

449
00:17:51,175 --> 00:17:52,421
那件婚纱可不便宜
That dress cost a fortune.

450
00:17:52,421 --> 00:17:55,682
不，我会等到Marshall什么时候做了错事
No,I'm just gonna wait for the next time
Marshall really screws up,

451
00:17:55,682 --> 00:17:56,737
然后，我在顺便提起来
and then,I'll just slip this in,

452
00:17:56,737 --> 00:17:59,422
这样有了比较就不显得糟
and it won't seem so bad by comparison.

453
00:17:59,422 --> 00:18:01,532
为他背着你偷腥干杯
here's hoping he cheats on you.

454
00:18:01,532 --> 00:18:03,834
但最好只到二垒
but only,like,second base.

455
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,054
瞧瞧我们，两个穿西装的男人
Look at us: Two guys in suits.

456
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:09,588
感受到空气中的一些刺激感了吗？
You feel that slight tingle?

457
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,178
那是酒吧里的每个姑娘都想要你
That's every girl in the bar wanting you,

458
00:18:12,178 --> 00:18:13,520
而每个男人都想要成为你
and every guy wanting to be you.

459
00:18:14,671 --> 00:18:15,438
事实上，大部分是冲我来的
Actually,it's mostly me,

460
00:18:15,438 --> 00:18:17,260
有些许反弹到你身上
but you're getting some of the splash.

461
00:18:20,138 --> 00:18:20,809
嘿，宝贝
hey,babe.

462
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:21,672
美元啤酒之夜
Dollar beer night,

463
00:18:21,672 --> 00:18:23,974
所以我炫耀一下,请每个人都喝一杯
so I splurged and got us each our own.

464
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,522
那么，有没有考虑到Barney集团来工作啊？
So,have you thought more about coming to work for Barney corp?

465
00:18:27,522 --> 00:18:28,002
得了吧
please

466
00:18:28,002 --> 00:18:30,591
你的公司才不叫Barney集团
your company is not called Barney corp.

467
00:18:30,591 --> 00:18:31,646
就快了
Yet.

468
00:18:32,317 --> 00:18:33,085
差点儿忘了
I almost forgot.

469
00:18:33,085 --> 00:18:34,523
Sergei把你的帐单给我
Sergei sent me your bill.

470
00:18:36,921 --> 00:18:40,086
B... Barney，这上面说要4000美元
B... Barney,this says $4,000.

471
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:42,867
我记得你说只要三分之一的价的
I thought you said that it was one-third price.

472
00:18:42,867 --> 00:18:44,209
那可能这是一套1万2的西装吧
must be a $12,000 suit.

473
00:18:44,209 --> 00:18:46,703
看来你必须来我公司了
guess you'll have to come work at my company.

474
00:18:47,278 --> 00:18:48,717
你忽悠我！
You set this up!

475
00:18:48,717 --> 00:18:50,156
这都是你在下圈套！
You set this whole thing up!

476
00:18:50,156 --> 00:18:53,512
我当然……这么做了
I most certainly did...

477
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:55,814
没用的
it won't work.

478
00:18:55,814 --> 00:18:57,636
就算我去打两份零工
Even if I have to get two extra night jobs,

479
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,266
我也会付这笔帐的
I'll pay your precious tailor.

480
00:18:59,266 --> 00:19:01,280
我不会出卖我的灵魂
I'm not selling my soul.

481
00:19:02,048 --> 00:19:03,966
宝贝，我知道今后会有点困难
Baby,I know that this will make things harder,

482
00:19:03,966 --> 00:19:06,076
但我会做到的，我保证
but I will make it work,I promise.

483
00:19:06,076 --> 00:19:09,049
我毁了一条8000块的婚纱
I destroyed an $8,000 wedding dress.

484
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:11,830
面试是什么时候？
What time is the interview?

485
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,940
上午9:00，你要准备双新鞋
9:00 A.M.,And you'll need new shoes.

486
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,762
别担心，我认识个人
Don't worry,I know a guy.

487
00:19:20,078 --> 00:19:23,626
我很高兴我们最后一天做了很多漂亮的凌空飞踢
I'm glad we got to spent the day doing awesome air kicks.

488
00:19:23,626 --> 00:19:26,311
我都快厌烦那些性爱了
I was almost too tired for all the sex.

489
00:19:29,476 --> 00:19:30,723
我会想念你的
I'm going to miss you so much.

490
00:19:30,723 --> 00:19:32,833
我也会想你的
I'm going to miss you,too.

491
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:40,889
嘿，你知道，我是说……要是
Hey,you know,I mean,if,

492
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:43,862
我回来之后，我们都还单身,我们可以……
when I get back,we're still single,we can...

493
00:19:43,862 --> 00:19:45,492
就算我们不是单身了
even if we're not.

494
00:20:05,248 --> 00:20:07,550
听着，我知道还没一次成功过
look,I know it never works for anyone,but...

495
00:20:07,838 --> 00:20:09,085
……你愿意尝试异地恋吗？
...do you want to try long distance?

496
00:20:09,085 --> 00:20:11,386
当然，当然！
Yes. Yes!

497
00:20:14,455 --> 00:20:15,318
我们可以打破绝对
we can beat the odds.

498
00:20:15,318 --> 00:20:16,757
绝对，去他的绝对
Odds,schmodds.

499
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,099
能成功的
It's gonna work.

500
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:18,963
我们会坚持下来的
We're going to make it work

501
00:20:18,963 --> 00:20:20,977
这能行
it'll work.

502
00:20:21,744 --> 00:20:23,182
这没成功
It didn't work.

503
00:20:23,182 --> 00:20:24,237
异地恋曾经是……
Long-distance was

504
00:20:24,237 --> 00:20:26,539
现在也是个糟糕的主意
and is a terrible idea,

505
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:28,937
非常糟糕的主意
a really terrible idea,

506
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:30,471
太糟糕了
just awful.

507
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:32,581
不过这都是后话了
But more on that later.
