4
00:00:13,106 --> 00:00:13,777
当你仍然单身
when you're single,

5
00:00:13,777 --> 00:00:15,504
但你的朋友们却陆续结婚时
and your friends start to get married,

6
00:00:15,504 --> 00:00:18,381
每一个婚礼邀请都是一次自我挑战
every wedding invitation presents a strange
moment of self-evaluation:

7
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:20,587
"您将带嘉宾出席
"Will you be bringing a guest,

8
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:22,696
还是独自出席?"
or will you be attending alone?"

9
00:00:22,696 --> 00:00:24,135
真正问的是
What it's really asking is,

10
00:00:24,135 --> 00:00:26,245
"3个月内去找个
"where do you see yourself in three months

11
00:00:26,245 --> 00:00:27,300
坐在旁边的女朋友
Sitting next to your girlfriend,

12
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,793
还是去追伴娘?"
or hitting on a bridesmaid?"

13
00:00:29,793 --> 00:00:32,191
我向来都是选择带嘉宾
I always checked that I was bringing a guest.

14
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,917
我是个乐观主义者
I was an optimist.

15
00:00:35,004 --> 00:00:35,932
两个月26天后
two months and 26 days later.

16
00:00:36,315 --> 00:00:37,753
我该带谁去这婚礼呢?
Who the hell am I gonna bring to this wedding?

17
00:00:37,753 --> 00:00:40,343
Ted, 你忘了我教你的吗?
Ted,have you ignored all my teachings?

18
00:00:40,343 --> 00:00:41,206
大部分是
For the most part,yeah.

19
00:00:41,206 --> 00:00:42,932
不, 你不能带伴去婚礼
No,you don't bring a date to a wedding.

20
00:00:42,932 --> 00:00:45,522
这就象拖着只鹿的尸体去打猎
That's like bringing a deer carcass on a hunting trip.

21
00:00:45,522 --> 00:00:46,672
噢 Ted 噢 Ted
oh,Ted. oh,Ted.

22
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:48,207
别 别带伴
No,no date.

23
00:00:48,207 --> 00:00:49,262
鹿尸? 真的吗?
Deer carcass? Really?

24
00:00:49,262 --> 00:00:50,796
你在暗示你要带去吗?
That's the metaphor you're going with here?

25
00:00:50,796 --> 00:00:52,235
Ted, 这只是个比喻
Ted,it's a simile.

26
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:53,673
已经太晚了
it's too late now.

27
00:00:53,673 --> 00:00:54,537
如果我不带个伴
If I don't bring a date,

28
00:00:54,537 --> 00:00:57,414
一份200块的鸡肉或鲑肉就没人吃了
a $200 piece of chicken/salmon
will go uneaten.

29
00:00:57,605 --> 00:00:59,332
我得带个人去, 但带谁呢?
I got to bring someone,but who?

30
00:00:59,332 --> 00:01:01,154
当然, 我知道我想带谁去
Of course,I knew who I wanted to bring.

31
00:01:01,154 --> 00:01:02,017
Robin
Robin

32
00:01:02,017 --> 00:01:04,702
不用想也知道的答案
the big unanswered question in my life.

33
00:01:04,702 --> 00:01:05,278
问题是
Problem was,

34
00:01:05,278 --> 00:01:08,155
她在和那个叫Derek的有钱家伙约会
she was dating this really rich guy named Derek.

35
00:01:08,826 --> 00:01:10,457
Derek.
Derek.

36
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,526
嗯, 我和Derek刚分手了
Well,Derek and I just broke up.

37
00:01:13,526 --> 00:01:14,964
噢, 太糟糕了!
no,that's terrible!

38
00:01:14,964 --> 00:01:15,731
你还好吧?
are you okay?

39
00:01:15,731 --> 00:01:17,841
你要喝点酒或者什么吗?
do you need a drink or something?

40
00:01:17,841 --> 00:01:18,800
我们不怎么合拍
we never really clicked.

41
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,759
但我还是满难过的
I felt bad,though.

42
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:20,718
他非常沮丧
He was pretty bummed.

43
00:01:20,718 --> 00:01:22,253
别责怪自己
don't beat yourself up.

44
00:01:22,253 --> 00:01:22,828
他会好起来的
He'll be fine.

45
00:01:22,828 --> 00:01:24,650
我说, 那家伙, 是个亿万富翁
I mean,the guy's,like,a billionaire.

46
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,568
他可以把他的白金卡放到钓线上
He can put his platinum card
on a fishing line

47
00:01:26,568 --> 00:01:28,678
钓10条比你性感的美女
and reel in ten chicks hotter than you.

48
00:01:28,678 --> 00:01:30,692
谢谢 我感觉好多了
Thanks. I feel a lot better.

49
00:01:30,692 --> 00:01:33,282
我想我要去喝点酒了
I think I'll get that drink now.

50
00:01:34,624 --> 00:01:36,447
好了, 伙计们, 我有话要说
Okay,guys,I got to say something.

51
00:01:37,214 --> 00:01:40,091
我觉得我对Robin的感觉又回来了
I think my feelings for Robin
may be resurfacing.

52
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:44,311
拜托 难道你还想死灰复燃
please,they were buried in a shallow grave.

53
00:01:44,311 --> 00:01:45,270
别又来
Not again.

54
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:45,845
拜托
Come on.

55
00:01:45,845 --> 00:01:46,517
伙计?
Dude?

56
00:01:46,517 --> 00:01:48,051
我们都知道电影的结果会怎样
We all know how this movie ends.

57
00:01:48,051 --> 00:01:49,394
Ted坠入爱河
Ted falls in love,

58
00:01:49,394 --> 00:01:52,271
Ted在萌芽期就被打击，然后就是滚动演员表
love kicks Ted in the sprouts,roll credits.

59
00:01:52,367 --> 00:01:55,244
不对, 你们看看这些画面就知道了
No,you guys just have to look
at the whole picture.

60
00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:58,984
场景: Robin对我一见钟情
fact:Robin was into me when we first met.

61
00:01:59,751 --> 00:02:00,902
场景: 尽管她不想交男朋友
fact:Even though she didn't want
a relationship,

62
00:02:00,902 --> 00:02:03,300
我们还是在屋顶来了个热吻
we had an amazing kiss on the roof.

63
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,410
场景: 新年夜
fact:On New Year's Eve,

64
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:06,848
我们又接吻了
we kissed again.

65
00:02:06,848 --> 00:02:09,533
场景: 我需要一个伴陪我去这个婚礼
fact:I need a date to this wedding.

66
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:10,972
祝我好运吧
Wish me luck.

67
00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:14,616
我不明白的是为什么Claudia要嫁给Stuart?
What I don't get is why is Claudia
marrying Stuart?

68
00:02:15,096 --> 00:02:16,822
她比他漂亮多了
She's way hotter than him.

69
00:02:16,822 --> 00:02:18,261
多多少?
How way?

70
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:19,603
多多了
Way way.

71
00:02:20,562 --> 00:02:23,440
但这个婚礼还是让人那么向往
This wedding does sound pretty amazing,though.

72
00:02:23,535 --> 00:02:25,645
高级酒店舞厅
Fancy hotel ballroom,

73
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,563
每个人都盛装打扮...
everybody all dressed up...

74
00:02:27,563 --> 00:02:28,618
来吧
here we go.

75
00:02:28,618 --> 00:02:29,290
什么?
What?

76
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,208
我们找不到满意的婚礼举行地
We can't get anywhere with our wedding plans

77
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:34,085
因为我想找有趣的的地方
而Marshall喜欢土气
because I want it to be fun and Marshall
wants it to be lame.

78
00:02:34,564 --> 00:02:36,578
好吧, 这说法真公平
Okay,that's a pretty fair assessment
of our two arguments.

79
00:02:36,578 --> 00:02:38,017
我也觉得
I thought so.

80
00:02:38,017 --> 00:02:38,496
知道吗?
You know what?

81
00:02:38,496 --> 00:02:41,278
抱歉 如果我不想赤脚在
Excuse me, if I don't want to get
married barefoot

82
00:02:41,278 --> 00:02:44,155
在车都开不进去的河边森林结婚
in the woods next to lake no-one's-
going- to-drive-that-far.

83
00:02:44,538 --> 00:02:45,306
是的
Yes.

84
00:02:45,306 --> 00:02:46,552
我想要在舞厅
I want a ballroom,

85
00:02:46,552 --> 00:02:49,430
想要支乐队, 还想要有鞋穿
and I want a band,and I want shoes.

86
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,019
我一直梦想着这天自从我还是个...
I've been dreaming about this day
since I was,like...

87
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:53,553
小女孩?
a little girl?

88
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:55,088
厉害!
what up!

89
00:02:55,088 --> 00:02:57,390
好吧 我只是想说这也是我的婚礼
Okay.I'm just saying that it's
my wedding,too,

90
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,732
我得发表点意见
and I should have a say in it.

91
00:02:58,732 --> 00:03:00,938
对啊, 但我才是新娘, 所以我说的算
Yes,but I'm the bride,so I win.

92
00:03:00,938 --> 00:03:03,815
我认为婚姻是两个平等的伴侣一起共渡余生
I thought marriage was about two
equal partners sharing a life together.

93
00:03:04,007 --> 00:03:06,405
对啊, 但我才是新娘, 所以我说的算
Right,but I'm the bride,so I win.

94
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,665
我说, 真的是Claudia和Stuart?
I mean,seriously,Claudia and Stuart?

95
00:03:09,665 --> 00:03:11,392
我是说, 我也交往过
I mean,I've hooked up with the odd lass

96
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:13,022
低于我魅力等级的女工
who was beneath my level of attractiveness,

97
00:03:13,022 --> 00:03:15,228
但, 我当时喝醉了
but,you know,I was drunk.

98
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:17,817
没道理Claudia醉酒了3年吧
There's no way Claudia has been drunk
for three years.

99
00:03:18,297 --> 00:03:20,311
你知道, 我一直认为忘记失恋痛苦
You know,I've always found that the best way

100
00:03:20,311 --> 00:03:22,133
的最好方法是去
to get over a failed relationship is

101
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:24,339
庆祝他人的美满生活
to celebrate someone else's successful one.

102
00:03:24,339 --> 00:03:26,161
有道理
it makes sense.

103
00:03:26,161 --> 00:03:27,791
那么, 你也这样想
So,with that in mind,

104
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,668
我们的朋友Claudia和Stuart周六举行个挺正式的婚礼
our friends Claudia and Stuart are having
this crazy black-tie wedding on Saturday.

105
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,162
你想当我的嘉宾吗?
You want to be my plus one?

106
00:03:33,641 --> 00:03:36,327
"嘉宾" 你说的真浪漫
"plus one." You make it sound so romantic.

107
00:03:36,327 --> 00:03:37,286
好了
Fine.

108
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,642
那你愿意当我的伴吗?
You want to be my date?

109
00:03:40,642 --> 00:03:41,122
你的伴?
Your date?

110
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:43,999
我很乐意
I'd love to.

111
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,492
这个婚礼到底多隆重?
How fancy are we talking about here?

112
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:48,315
你可能要带上你最好的行头
you're going to want to
bring your "A" game.

113
00:03:48,315 --> 00:03:48,890
噢 我会的
Oh,I'll bring it.

114
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:49,945
我会穿得很抢眼
I'll bring it so hard,

115
00:03:49,945 --> 00:03:52,438
让新娘看起来象个白色袋子装起来的螃蟹
the bride's going to look like a big white bag of crap.

116
00:03:53,877 --> 00:03:54,740
Lily?
Lily?

117
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,795
我需要件礼服
I need a dress.

118
00:03:55,795 --> 00:03:56,658
你要去吗?
you're going?

119
00:03:56,658 --> 00:03:57,617
太棒了!
That's awesome!

120
00:03:57,617 --> 00:03:58,289
我的天
my god

121
00:03:58,289 --> 00:03:59,344
四天内找到礼服?
four days to find a dress?

122
00:03:59,344 --> 00:04:01,262
我知道, 这会让人想自杀
I know,it's a suicide mission.

123
00:04:01,262 --> 00:04:02,317
如果我们现在就开始...
if we leave now...

124
00:04:02,317 --> 00:04:03,947
我们还有机会胜利
we can still have a fighting chance.

125
00:04:03,947 --> 00:04:05,098
来吧!
Let's do it!

126
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:06,057
拜, 宝贝
Bye,babe.

127
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,605
你们看她多有激情?
Did you see how fired up she was?

128
00:04:09,605 --> 00:04:11,044
我不知道, 已经有点什么了
I don't know,there's something there.

129
00:04:11,044 --> 00:04:12,099
等到周六
And,come Saturday,

130
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:14,305
来点音乐, 舞蹈,几杯香槟...
a little music,a little dancing, a lot of champagne...

131
00:04:14,305 --> 00:04:15,647
谁知道会怎样?
who knows?

132
00:04:15,647 --> 00:04:17,661
Ted, 你得再去认识个绅士了
Ted,you're going to have to find another gender for yourself,

133
00:04:17,661 --> 00:04:20,251
因为我要废了你的"兄弟"会员卡
cause I'm revoking your "dude"
membership.

134
00:04:20,634 --> 00:04:22,936
耶, 昨天你修甲修的怎么样?
Yeah,how was that manicure yesterday?

135
00:04:23,415 --> 00:04:25,238
不错, 谢谢
Invigorating,thanks.

136
00:04:26,005 --> 00:04:28,690
好吧, 我不会在他们面前说这些
Okay,I wasn't going to say it in front of the guys,

137
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,567
但我那时候真的认为事情会发展的很顺利
but back then I really thought that's how it worked.

138
00:04:35,595 --> 00:04:38,472
和你喜欢的女孩在浪漫的地方...
You put yourself and a girl you like
in some romantic setting...

139
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:43,363
...灯光闪烁...
...the stars line up...

140
00:04:44,131 --> 00:04:45,665
可惜眨眼就没
and shazam.

141
00:04:47,775 --> 00:04:49,981
我知道现实从来不会这么简单达成
I know now that life is never that
simple.

142
00:04:49,981 --> 00:04:51,515
嘿, Claudia!
Hey,Claudia!

143
00:04:52,187 --> 00:04:54,105
对, 我要塔希提香草!
yes,I want tahitian vanilla!

144
00:04:54,105 --> 00:04:55,735
你写错了吗?
You wrote it down wrong?

145
00:04:55,735 --> 00:04:57,174
不对, 不对, 听我说
No,no,no,no,listen to me

146
00:04:57,174 --> 00:04:59,763
如果我发现婚礼上蛋糕不是塔希提香草味的
if I go to my wedding and the cake is not tahitian vanilla,

147
00:04:59,763 --> 00:05:02,640
我会去你那把店给拆了!
I will come down there and
burn your little shop to the ground!

148
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,983
你想试下我是不是开玩笑吗?
Do you want to find out if I'm kidding?

149
00:05:03,983 --> 00:05:05,134
再见
good-bye.

150
00:05:08,682 --> 00:05:09,929
怎么样了?
How's it going?

151
00:05:09,929 --> 00:05:11,272
我的婚礼就在两天后了
My wedding is in two days,

152
00:05:11,272 --> 00:05:12,135
就这样
that's how it's going.

153
00:05:12,135 --> 00:05:13,286
别担心, 会很棒的
don't worry,it's going to be great.

154
00:05:13,286 --> 00:05:14,724
我很期待
I'm so excited.

155
00:05:14,724 --> 00:05:15,395
你当然会
you should be

156
00:05:15,395 --> 00:05:17,122
大把的单身女孩
lots of single girls.

157
00:05:17,122 --> 00:05:18,081
我会...
I'm...

158
00:05:18,081 --> 00:05:19,136
带个伴去
bringing a date,

159
00:05:19,136 --> 00:05:21,150
所以那些与我无关了
so I'll be off the market.

160
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:21,821
什么?
What?

161
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,068
我要带着伴去
I'm bringing a date.

162
00:05:23,068 --> 00:05:24,506
你不会带
You're not bringing a date.

163
00:05:25,178 --> 00:05:26,328
不, 我会
yes,I am.

164
00:05:26,712 --> 00:05:28,247
不, 你不会
no,you're not.

165
00:05:28,247 --> 00:05:29,110
我填了"带嘉宾"
I checked "plus one."

166
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,261
没, 你没有
No,you didn't.

167
00:05:30,836 --> 00:05:32,466
Claudia, 我很确定我有填...
Claudia,I'm pretty sure I checked...

168
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:34,001
Ted, 你没有填 "带嘉宾"!
Ted,you did not check "plus one"!

169
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,111
你不能带着伴来我婚礼!
You are not bringing a date to my wedding!

170
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,961
我已经邀请人了
But I already invited someone.

171
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:45,687
你不会带嘉宾来, Ted!
you are not bringing a guest,Ted!

172
00:05:45,687 --> 00:05:47,125
嘉宾名单几个月前就确定了
The guest list has been closed for months

173
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:47,893
几个月!
months!

174
00:05:47,893 --> 00:05:49,044
但我有填 "带嘉宾"!
But I checked "plus one"!

175
00:05:49,044 --> 00:05:50,290
我一直都是填"带嘉宾"!
I always check "plus one"!

176
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,592
你绝对没有填
"带嘉宾"!
You absolutely did not check
"plus one"!

177
00:05:52,592 --> 00:05:53,551
如果你填的是"带嘉宾"
If you had checked "plus one,"

178
00:05:53,551 --> 00:05:55,085
我会致电给你索要嘉宾姓名
I would have called you to get
the name of your guest,

179
00:05:55,085 --> 00:05:56,428
以便座位上放置名牌
so I could have the place cards
prind up.

180
00:05:56,428 --> 00:05:57,579
我有找你要你的嘉宾姓名吗?
Did I call you to get the name
of your guest?

181
00:05:57,579 --> 00:05:59,593
有印着她名字的名牌吗?
Is there a place card with her
name printed on it?

182
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:00,648
她不需要名牌
She doesn't need a place card.

183
00:06:00,648 --> 00:06:01,991
她知道自己叫什么
She knows her name.

184
00:06:01,991 --> 00:06:03,046
那她吃什么?!
What's she eating?!

185
00:06:03,046 --> 00:06:03,621
你定了鸡肉
You ordered the chicken.

186
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:04,196
她有什么?
What did she order?

187
00:06:04,196 --> 00:06:06,978
你知道你的故事有多少漏洞吗?
Do you see how your story is
full of holes?

188
00:06:06,978 --> 00:06:09,183
拜托, Claudia, 我们回到正事吧
Come on,Claudia,we go way back.

189
00:06:09,183 --> 00:06:11,101
就没有一个多出来的位置吗?
Isn't there room for just one
more person?

190
00:06:11,101 --> 00:06:13,211
别逼我出手, Ted
Don't make me hurt you,Ted.

191
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:15,129
我不敢相信!
I don't believ this!

192
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:16,856
Claudia疯了!
Claudia's crazy!

193
00:06:16,856 --> 00:06:17,527
但, 公平来说
But,to be fair,

194
00:06:17,527 --> 00:06:19,925
她也很性感
我明明填了"带嘉宾"
she's also hot 
I totally checked "plus one."

195
00:06:19,925 --> 00:06:20,884
我确定
I'm sure I did.

196
00:06:20,884 --> 00:06:22,226
是啊
我有填!
right.
I did!

197
00:06:22,226 --> 00:06:23,473
耶，我不觉得你有
Yeah,I don't think you did.

198
00:06:23,473 --> 00:06:24,432
知道为什么吗?
You know why?

199
00:06:24,432 --> 00:06:25,008
因为你内心深处
Because deep down,

200
00:06:25,008 --> 00:06:27,117
不想带着嘉宾参加婚礼
you didn't want to show up at
this thing with a date.

201
00:06:27,117 --> 00:06:29,995
你说了那么多关于准备好交女朋友的谎话
See,for all your big talk about being ready for a relationship,

202
00:06:30,282 --> 00:06:31,625
归根结底你还是单身
deep down,you're single.

203
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,447
这是你的"默认设置"
It's your "default setting".

204
00:06:33,447 --> 00:06:36,036
Ted, 你知道你脑袋深处?
Ted,you know what's in the back of your brain?

205
00:06:36,036 --> 00:06:38,242
噢天, "小Barney"演说又来了
great,here comes the little Barney speech.

206
00:06:38,242 --> 00:06:39,010
秘密的
Behind a curtain,

207
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,887
有一小处地方偷偷控制着你的行动?
in a dark little room secretly controlling your every move?

208
00:06:42,846 --> 00:06:45,051
小Barney...
A Little Barney...

209
00:06:45,051 --> 00:06:47,065
小Barney
a little Barney.

210
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,463
知道他说什么吗?
And you know what he said?

211
00:06:49,463 --> 00:06:50,518
"Ted... "
"Ted... "

212
00:06:50,518 --> 00:06:53,203
"你不会带着伴参加这个婚礼"
you will bring no dates to this wedding.

213
00:06:53,203 --> 00:06:54,258
"你... "
"You... "

214
00:06:54,258 --> 00:06:57,135
"你将和正常大小的Barney一起泡醉酒的伴娘"
will hit on drunk bridesmaids with actual-size Barney."

215
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,204
别说了
Please stop.

216
00:07:00,204 --> 00:07:01,259
我要去给Claudia打电话
I got to call Claudia.

217
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:02,698
- 如果我对她解释...
- Ted, 别!
-If I just explain to her...
-Ted,no!

218
00:07:02,698 --> 00:07:03,753
算了吧
Let it go.

219
00:07:03,753 --> 00:07:04,712
她要结婚了
She's about to get married,

220
00:07:04,712 --> 00:07:06,150
有够多的事情得操心了
she's got enough to worry about.

221
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,397
那我该怎么办?
Then what am I going to do?

222
00:07:07,397 --> 00:07:08,644
你能做的只有
The only thing you can do

223
00:07:08,644 --> 00:07:10,850
告诉Robin她不能去了
tell Robin she can't come.

224
00:07:14,878 --> 00:07:16,316
等一下!
Just a second!

225
00:07:19,193 --> 00:07:20,536
- 听着...
- 等等, 两件事
- Listen...
- wait,two things.

226
00:07:20,536 --> 00:07:21,591
首先...
First of all...

227
00:07:21,591 --> 00:07:23,509
我整个下午都在为你"打基础"
I have been laying groundwork all afternoon.

228
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:25,907
非常微妙地, 沉着地不催, 也不明显暗示
Totally subtle,totally cool,not pushing,not even nudging,

229
00:07:25,907 --> 00:07:28,688
都是为了今天的主题,"Ted最棒"
just: The theme of today is,"Ted rocks."

230
00:07:28,688 --> 00:07:30,510
她正慢慢中我的计
And she's picking up what I'm laying down.

231
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,373
- Lily,现在有问题是... !
- 等等, 别
- Lily,there's a problem... !
- Wait,no.

232
00:07:31,373 --> 00:07:34,058
第二件事: 礼服
Thing number two: The dress.

233
00:07:34,058 --> 00:07:35,401
我们找到了礼服
We got a dress.

234
00:07:37,799 --> 00:07:39,141
去吧
Go.

235
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:43,457
这样行了吧, 还是...
Did I bring it,or...

236
00:07:44,704 --> 00:07:45,663
这样行了吧?
did I bring it?

237
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,293
我确实穿了最好的行头
I think I brought it.

238
00:07:49,787 --> 00:07:51,513
就是为了这个
That's what I was going for.

239
00:07:52,088 --> 00:07:53,239
我太期待明天了
I'm so excited about tomorrow.

240
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,965
明天我们会很开心
We're going to have so much fun.

241
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,692
关于这个...
about that...

242
00:07:58,706 --> 00:08:00,624
我五点来接你
I'll pick you up at 5:00.

243
00:08:07,762 --> 00:08:10,160
嗯? 礼服怎么样?
so? The dress?

244
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,982
我不能带嘉宾去婚礼
I don't have a plus one for the wedding.

245
00:08:11,982 --> 00:08:12,749
什么?
What?

246
00:08:12,749 --> 00:08:13,420
我碰见Claudia
I ran into Claudia,

247
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,818
她告诉我我没有在回复卡上填"带嘉宾"
and she told me I didn't check
"plus one" on the reply card.

248
00:08:15,818 --> 00:08:16,873
为什么你没填 "带..."?
Why didn't you check "plus..."?

249
00:08:16,873 --> 00:08:18,599
我有填 "带嘉宾"
I did check "plus one."

250
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,134
Robin这么期待
But Robin is so excited.

251
00:08:20,134 --> 00:08:20,901
我知道
I know.

252
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:21,572
还有礼服!
And the dress!

253
00:08:21,572 --> 00:08:23,107
我知道
I know.

254
00:08:24,066 --> 00:08:24,641
好吧, 好吧
okay,okay.

255
00:08:24,641 --> 00:08:25,792
我们把她偷偷弄进去
we'll sneak her in.

256
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:26,847
我们不能把她偷偷弄进去
We can't sneak her in,

257
00:08:26,847 --> 00:08:28,669
我们又不是忍者
we're not ninjas.

258
00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:29,628
真希望我们是忍者
I wish we were ninjas.

259
00:08:29,628 --> 00:08:30,779
我知道
I know.

260
00:08:32,218 --> 00:08:33,752
你可以去问下Stuart
You could always ask Stuart.

261
00:08:33,752 --> 00:08:34,615
可以这样吗?
Can I do that?

262
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:35,574
当然
sure.

263
00:08:35,574 --> 00:08:38,068
你们那么久的朋友了
You guys have been friends for a long time.

264
00:08:38,068 --> 00:08:40,369
而且那婚礼他占4成
And it's 40% his wedding,too.

265
00:08:41,137 --> 00:08:42,096
我不知道...
I don't know...

266
00:08:42,096 --> 00:08:43,342
这可不太好谈
it's going to be a tough sell.

267
00:08:43,342 --> 00:08:45,356
伙计, 没问题
Dude,no problem whatsoever.

268
00:08:45,356 --> 00:08:46,028
真的吗?
Really?

269
00:08:46,028 --> 00:08:47,850
当然, 越多越好
Sure,the more,the merrier.

270
00:08:48,905 --> 00:08:50,248
谢谢你这样通融
thanks for being so cool about this,

271
00:08:50,248 --> 00:08:51,974
因为Claudia说...
cause you know,Claudia said...

272
00:08:51,974 --> 00:08:53,221
今天早晨演练时
This morning at the rehearsal,

273
00:08:53,221 --> 00:08:56,098
Claudia骂我们7岁的花童是婊子
Claudia called our seven-year-old
flower girl a whore.

274
00:08:56,673 --> 00:08:57,728
所以, 别生气
So,don't take it personally,

275
00:08:57,728 --> 00:08:59,167
她只是压力太大了
she's just a little stressed.

276
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:00,701
她一般不是这样的
she's not usually like that.

277
00:09:00,701 --> 00:09:01,852
是啊
No.

278
00:09:04,345 --> 00:09:05,688
谢谢, Stu!
thanks,Stu!

279
00:09:05,688 --> 00:09:07,894
婚礼会很棒的
It's going to be a great wedding.

280
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,593
亲爱的, 这杂志上说越来越多的夫妻
Honey,this magazine says more and more couples are opting

281
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:15,470
选择在树林里举行非传统的婚礼
to have non-traditional weddings out in the woods.

282
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,909
如果杂志都这样说了
if a magazine says so,

283
00:09:16,909 --> 00:09:18,252
我们应该在树林里结婚
we should go get married in the woods,

284
00:09:18,252 --> 00:09:20,361
就象松鼠一样
like a couple of squirrels.

285
00:09:20,361 --> 00:09:22,759
松鼠才不会结婚, Marshall
Squirrels don't get married,Marshall.

286
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:25,157
好象你就知道似的
Like you could possibly know that.

287
00:09:26,212 --> 00:09:27,171
我做到了
I did it.

288
00:09:27,171 --> 00:09:27,842
我做到了
I did it

289
00:09:27,842 --> 00:09:28,993
我要带她去婚礼
I'm taking her to the wedding.

290
00:09:28,993 --> 00:09:29,760
很好!
Nice!

291
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,623
什么? 怎么带?
What? How?

292
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,966
我找Stuart了
I talked to Stuart.

293
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:34,459
你找新郎下手
you went around the bride.

294
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:36,665
"噢, 这些黄蜂窝似乎无害
"Oh,this hornets' nest looks harmless.

295
00:09:36,665 --> 00:09:38,775
也许我可以用木棍去捅捅"
Maybe I'll poke it with a stick."

296
00:09:38,775 --> 00:09:39,926
"噢, 看, 有小妖精
"Oh,look,some gremlins.

297
00:09:39,926 --> 00:09:41,652
我们午夜后来喂他们!"
Let me go feed them after midnight!"

298
00:09:41,652 --> 00:09:43,378
你知道这些吗?
Did you know about this?

299
00:09:44,146 --> 00:09:46,351
那可能是我的主意
It may have been my idea.

300
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:47,598
什么?
what?

301
00:09:47,598 --> 00:09:49,612
Stuart就不能作主吗?
Stuart doesn't get a say?

302
00:09:49,612 --> 00:09:50,571
所以你同意了
So you admit it

303
00:09:50,571 --> 00:09:53,161
新郎有同等的权利
the groom should have an equal say.

304
00:09:53,161 --> 00:09:56,038
当然, 在一些蠢事上, 象邀请谁
sure,on the stupid stuff,like who comes.

305
00:09:56,038 --> 00:09:57,764
所以我随便邀请谁都行吗?
So I can invite whoever I want?

306
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,353
当然, 树林里空间很大
Sure,there's plenty of room in the woods.

307
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,190
是Claudia
it's Claudia.

308
00:10:04,861 --> 00:10:06,395
来了
So it begins.

309
00:10:06,395 --> 00:10:08,601
拜托, 不会那么糟的
Come on,it can't be that bad.

310
00:10:09,177 --> 00:10:10,711
来, Lily, 你来听
here,Lily,you answer it.

311
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:11,670
什么? 为什么?
What? Why?

312
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,109
因为这都是你的主意
Because this whole thing was your idea.

313
00:10:13,109 --> 00:10:14,355
而且...我很怕Claudia
And... Claudia scares me.

314
00:10:14,355 --> 00:10:15,314
但... 你才是...
But... but you're the...

315
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:16,561
但我只是想...

316
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,342
Ted的电话

317
00:10:20,014 --> 00:10:21,165
嗨 Claudia
Hi Claudia.

318
00:10:21,644 --> 00:10:22,699
什么?
What?

319
00:10:22,699 --> 00:10:23,946
我不在场
Now I wasn't there,

320
00:10:23,946 --> 00:10:25,192
但从我听到的判断
but from what I heard,

321
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:27,015
事情是这样的...
it went something like this...

322
00:10:27,015 --> 00:10:27,782
还有, 亲爱的
by the way,honey,

323
00:10:27,782 --> 00:10:30,659
Ted来过我告诉他可以带着伴来婚礼
Ted stopped by and I told him he could bring his date to the wedding.

324
00:10:31,043 --> 00:10:32,385
你说什么?
You what?

325
00:10:35,071 --> 00:10:37,756
...老是在背后拖我后腿...
...always undermining me at every turn...

326
00:10:40,249 --> 00:10:41,688
...试着变通一下
...try to show a little flexibility,

327
00:10:41,688 --> 00:10:42,647
但你没有!

328
00:10:42,647 --> 00:10:44,373
全是考虑你!

...还有你妈...
...and your mother...

330
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,101
你知道吗?

331
00:10:53,101 --> 00:10:54,827
婚礼取消!
The wedding's off!

332

不是我的错, 是不?

我爸已经为这婚礼花了很多钱了!
And my dad already paid for this huge wedding!

335

然后他会去杀了Ted!
And then he's gonna kill Ted!

337
00:11:10,747 --> 00:11:12,665
我也会去杀了Ted
Then I'm gonna kill Ted.

338
00:11:12,665 --> 00:11:13,624
是Robin

339
00:11:13,624 --> 00:11:14,775

我会让Lily转告我

听着, 我很想继续聊

348

但现在时机不对

349

还有我很期待明天好了, 拜

糟糕, 她买了双很贵的鞋

她真的很期待这个

你认为她喜欢我吗?

354

Ted, 注意!

好, 好了, 甜心, 冷静

你想去什么地方谈谈吗?

I miss being single.

395

我想念晚归
I miss staying out late,

396
00:13:11,622 --> 00:13:13,828
和家里一团乱不去清理

397
00:13:13,828 --> 00:13:15,171
我想念黄书
I miss owning porn.

398
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,993
伙计, 谁不会呢?
Dude,who doesn't?

399
00:13:16,993 --> 00:13:19,870
还有, 我会遇见一些超级性感的模特
我会想...
And you know,I'll see some
super-hot model chick,and I'll think,

but right now,that's just not
who I am.

409
00:13:31,954 --> 00:13:33,009
我不是一个懂承诺的人
I'm not a commitment guy;

410
00:13:33,009 --> 00:13:34,064
我是个单身的人

Stuart, 你不需要做任何人
Stuart,you don't have to be one

414
00:13:40,106 --> 00:13:41,353
需要很大努力
they're hard work.

415
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:42,695
这是关于包容
It's about compromise,

416
00:13:42,695 --> 00:13:44,709
一起成长...等等Phil博士语录

417
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:46,435
你怎么知道? 你都没结婚

You're not even married.

418
00:13:46,435 --> 00:13:47,682

422
00:13:53,628 --> 00:13:54,971
Stuart, 别结婚
Stuart,don't get married.

423
00:13:54,971 --> 00:13:55,834
- 伙计...
- 什么?
- Dude...
- what?

424
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,273
听着, 我很抱歉
Look,I'm sorry.

425
00:13:57,656 --> 00:13:59,095
做夫妻很难
Being in a couple is hard.

426
00:13:59,095 --> 00:14:01,972
承诺, 妥协, 都很难
And committing,making sacrifices,
it's hard.

427
00:14:02,355 --> 00:14:05,137
但如果是你的正确人选
就会很容易
But if it's the right person,
then it's easy.

428
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:06,096
看着这女孩
Looking at that girl

429
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:07,534
知道她就是你一生至爱
and knowing she's all you really
want out of life,

430
00:14:07,534 --> 00:14:09,069
这些事就顺理成章了
that should be the easiest thing
in the world,

431
00:14:09,069 --> 00:14:10,795
但如果不行
and if it's not like that,

432
00:14:11,275 --> 00:14:12,905
那她就不是最合适的
then she's not the one.

433
00:14:12,905 --> 00:14:14,056
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

434
00:14:18,563 --> 00:14:21,153
你知道我没有40万, 是不?
You know I don't have $400,000,right?

435
00:14:22,687 --> 00:14:24,893
也许我们结婚还太年轻了
Maybe we got together too young.

436
00:14:24,893 --> 00:14:27,482
也许这就是问题所在
Maybe that's what the problem was.

437
00:14:27,482 --> 00:14:30,359
我是说, 我28岁
I mean,I'm 28 years old,

438
00:14:31,031 --> 00:14:33,908
只和一个男人在一起过
and I've really only ever been
with one man.

439
00:14:35,634 --> 00:14:37,648
这太
that's just,

440
00:14:37,648 --> 00:14:38,511
这...
that's...

441
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:41,388
再来两杯草莓伏特加, 谢谢!
two more vodka cranberries,please!

442
00:14:42,827 --> 00:14:43,978
Claudia...
Claudia...

443
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:46,280
会好起来的
it's all gonna be okay.

444
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:50,691
谢谢你听我说, Barney
thanks for listening,Barney.

445
00:14:50,691 --> 00:14:52,801
对我来说很有帮助
it really means a lot to me.

446
00:14:53,376 --> 00:14:55,390
我们象这样相遇...
Isn't it weird that we should...

447
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,404
会不会很怪?
run into each other like this?

448
00:14:57,884 --> 00:14:59,610
两颗心
Two souls,

449
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:02,487
两个有同等级魅力的人
of equal levels of attractiveness,

450
00:15:02,775 --> 00:15:08,529
就像磁铁一样互相吸引
both fitting together like two
pieces of a very attractive puzzle.

451
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,927
去死, 别想!
hell,no!

452
00:15:13,133 --> 00:15:15,243
Claudia明天就要结婚了
Claudia is getting married tomorrow,

453
00:15:15,243 --> 00:15:16,393
帮帮我
and so help me god,

454
00:15:16,393 --> 00:15:19,270
如果被我抓到你和她呼吸同样的空气
if I catch you even so much as
breathing the same air as her,

455
00:15:19,366 --> 00:15:22,244
我都会抓住你当睾丸用的"花生仁"
I will take those peanuts you're
trying to pass off as testicles,

456
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:25,025
我会使劲捏,让你痛得眼珠都突出来
and I will squeeze them so hard
your eyes pop out,

457
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:27,710
然后把它象葡萄一样喂给你!
and then I'll feed them to you
like grapes!

458
00:15:27,998 --> 00:15:30,108
等等, 我的眼珠还是睾丸?
Wait,my eyes or my testicles?

459
00:15:30,108 --> 00:15:31,258
一样一颗
One of each.

460
00:15:31,258 --> 00:15:33,464
好吧! 好吧!
All right! All right!

461
00:15:33,464 --> 00:15:34,903
Claudia?
Claudia?

462
00:15:35,382 --> 00:15:36,533
Stuart
Stuart.

463
00:15:36,533 --> 00:15:37,492
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

464
00:15:37,492 --> 00:15:39,314
我也很抱歉
I'm so sorry,too.

465
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:40,082
我爱你
I love you.

466
00:15:40,082 --> 00:15:41,904
我也爱你, 宝贝
I love you too,babe.

467
00:15:41,904 --> 00:15:43,534
Marshall和Ted让我看清了
Marshall and Ted set me straight.

468
00:15:43,534 --> 00:15:45,165
当Marshall说我不要结婚时
And when Marshall told me not to marry you,

469
00:15:45,165 --> 00:15:46,220
让我明白我...
it made me realize I...

470
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,179
Marshall说什么?!
Marshall said what?!

471
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:48,905
事情比你想的复杂!
It's more complicated than that!

472
00:15:48,905 --> 00:15:50,439
他让我明白我有多爱你
He made me realize how much I love you.

473
00:15:50,439 --> 00:15:52,357
他们让我们俩复合
These guys got us back together.

474
00:15:52,357 --> 00:15:54,467
好了, 我没事了, 我没事了
Okay,I'm cool,I'm cool.

475
00:16:08,086 --> 00:16:10,867
那我带嘉宾的事什么时候讨论?
So where did we land on the whole
plus one thing?

476
00:16:12,018 --> 00:16:13,264
别, 别, 别, 别!
no,no,no,no!

477
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:16,142
又叫了3杯草莓伏特加才让Claudia静下来
It took three more vodka Cranberries
to subdue Claudia,

478
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:17,676
但, 最后
but,eventually,

479
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:20,553
她和善的同意了我带Robin去
she graciously agreed to let me
bring Robin.

480
00:16:23,143 --> 00:16:24,485
还是让人"哇"
Still wow.

481
00:16:25,157 --> 00:16:25,924
你也是
Wow yourself.

482
00:16:25,924 --> 00:16:27,746
看看你准备的行头
Look who else brought it.

483
00:16:28,609 --> 00:16:30,335
我本来不想穿这样的
I thought about leaving it at home,

484
00:16:30,335 --> 00:16:31,966
但我不想到那儿后
but I figured I don't want to get there

485
00:16:31,966 --> 00:16:34,172
发现我需要它再跑回去拿
and realize I need it and have to
go all the way back to get it.

486
00:16:34,172 --> 00:16:36,665
所以, 我穿来了
So,,I brought it.

487
00:16:37,816 --> 00:16:39,159
抱歉
sorry.

488
00:16:41,844 --> 00:16:43,091
喂?
Hello?

489
00:16:44,721 --> 00:16:45,968
我的天 今晚?
my god.Tonight?

490
00:16:45,968 --> 00:16:47,119
你开玩笑吧
You're kidding.

491
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:49,612
他们想要我今晚去代播新闻
They want me to anchor the news tonight.

492
00:16:49,612 --> 00:16:50,763
真的吗?
Really?

493
00:16:50,763 --> 00:16:53,065
真的代播?
Like anchor anchor?

494
00:16:54,407 --> 00:16:56,517
Sandy怎么了?
what happened to Sandy?

495
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:59,298
好 好 当然
Okay. Okay. Sure.

496
00:16:59,298 --> 00:17:00,353
要什么时候...
What time do you need me to...

497
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,600
就现在?!
right now?!

498
00:17:03,614 --> 00:17:04,765
去吧
Do it.

499
00:17:06,587 --> 00:17:07,738
去吧
Do it.

500
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,437
好的, 我需要5分钟换衣服, 然后
Okay,I need like five minutes to change,and,

501
00:17:12,917 --> 00:17:13,972
我在出租车上打给你...
I'll call you from the cab...

502
00:17:23,946 --> 00:17:25,288
同意吧
so admit it.

503
00:17:25,288 --> 00:17:28,165
这个在室内的婚礼同样精彩
This wedding is both indoors and amazing.

504
00:17:28,645 --> 00:17:29,892
我会给你点虾肉糕
I'll give you the crab puffs.

505
00:17:29,892 --> 00:17:31,426
那虾肉糕不错
The crab puffs are good.

506
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:32,577
那些虾肉糕让人难以置信
The crab puffs were incredible.

507
00:17:32,577 --> 00:17:34,303
我们婚礼上也应该有
We should totally have them at our wedding.

508
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,262
当然...
Definitely...

509
00:17:37,276 --> 00:17:38,619
嘿, 我们刚刚达成了某种共识
We just agreed on something.

510
00:17:38,619 --> 00:17:41,400
我们开始谈论我们的婚礼了吗?
Did we just start planning our wedding?

511
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,839
我想是的
I think that we did.

512
00:17:45,236 --> 00:17:47,442
我们也得那些棕色的酱汁
We totally have to get that brown dipping sauce.

513
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:49,936
我认为要红色那个,非常棒
I thought the red sauce was,like,awesome.

514
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:52,813
天, 你天生没有味蕾吗?
My god,were you born without taste buds?

515
00:17:54,443 --> 00:17:55,402
什么?
what?

516
00:17:56,074 --> 00:17:57,224
我爱你
I love you.

517

现在下一条新闻

00:18:03,938 --> 00:18:06,143
有蛇住在你们墙里面吗?
are there snakes living in your walls?

519
00:18:06,143 --> 00:18:07,870
答案可能会吓到你...
The answer may surprise you...

520
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,404
休息后揭晓
after the break.

521
00:18:16,117 --> 00:18:17,460
伙计, 你知道吗?
man,you know something?

522
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,995
Stuart是我的新英雄
Stuart's my new hero.

523
00:18:18,995 --> 00:18:21,200
如果那家伙能娶一个可以打9分的
If that dude can bag a nine,

524
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,886
那我就可以找到16分的
I got to be able to bag,like,a 16.

525
00:18:23,886 --> 00:18:25,324
16分是什么?
What's a 16?

526
00:18:25,324 --> 00:18:27,051
那边两个8分的加起来
Those two eights right over there.

527
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:30,983
嗨 Ted
Hi Ted.

00:18:30,983 --> 00:18:32,038
Claudia
Claudia.

529
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:35,682
我们想和那位差点让我们分手的女士合影
We just wanted to get a picture with the
woman who almost ended our relationship.

530
00:18:36,161 --> 00:18:37,504
她在哪?
where is she?

531
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,765
她没来
she couldn't make it.

532
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,176
有什么好笑的?
what's so funny?

533
00:18:45,176 --> 00:18:46,231
去策划一个婚礼
plan a wedding.

534
00:18:46,231 --> 00:18:47,190
你就知道了
You'll see.

535
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:52,945
看那边
Look at that.

536
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,575
应该那要才对
That's how it's supposed to be.

537
00:18:54,575 --> 00:18:55,822
就那样
That right there.

538
00:18:56,205 --> 00:18:57,740
容易, 简单
Easy,simple.

539
00:18:58,411 --> 00:19:00,617
和Robin一起就不能那样
It's just not like that with Robin.

540
00:19:01,001 --> 00:19:03,206
一点也不容易, 某种程度上来说
It's not easy,and on some level,

541
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,988
应该是很容易的
it has to just be easy.

542
00:19:06,851 --> 00:19:08,289
说道容易...
Speaking of easy...

543
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:09,728
伴娘们, Ted
bridesmaids,Ted.

544
00:19:09,728 --> 00:19:11,358
伴娘们
Bridesmaids.

545
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,756
顺便说下, 我差点忘了
By the way,I almost forgot.

546
00:19:13,756 --> 00:19:15,482
我们找到这个
We found this.

547
00:19:20,373 --> 00:19:22,099
我没有填 "带嘉宾"
I didn't check "plus one."

548
00:19:22,483 --> 00:19:23,538
你是对的
You were right.

549
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:25,168
当然, 我是对的
Of course,I was right.

550
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:27,854
我单身
I'm single.

551
00:19:28,621 --> 00:19:30,347
可能这就是我
Maybe that's just who I am.

552
00:19:30,347 --> 00:19:31,114
你知道吗?
And you know what?

553
00:19:31,114 --> 00:19:32,553
我喜欢单身
I like being single.

554
00:19:32,553 --> 00:19:33,992
单身很好
Being single's the best.

555
00:19:33,992 --> 00:19:35,238
想在外面待多晚都行
stay out as late as you want.

556
00:19:35,238 --> 00:19:36,101
不用对谁交代
Answer to no one.

557
00:19:36,101 --> 00:19:38,691
整个世界充满着无穷的可能性
The whole world full of endless possibilities.

558
00:19:38,691 --> 00:19:40,897
永远不用去农贸市场
Never having to go to a farmer's market.

559
00:19:45,308 --> 00:19:46,555
好了
Okay.

560
00:19:46,555 --> 00:19:48,281
来点算术
doing some math here.

561
00:19:48,281 --> 00:19:49,720
6号桌有3个伴娘
Table six has got three bridesmaids:

562
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,734
8分, 8分, 和一个7分
An eight,an eight,and a seven.

563
00:19:52,213 --> 00:19:54,994
我很乐意给你一个8分的
I am willing to give you one of the eights,

564
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:56,625
让我降低到15分
lowering myself to a 15,

565
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,831
这表示你欠我...
which means you owe me...

566
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:00,077
这就是我们
so there we were,

567
00:20:00,077 --> 00:20:01,420
两个单身的家伙
two single guys,

568
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,722
做着普通单身该做的事情
doing our usual single-guy thing.

569
00:20:04,009 --> 00:20:04,873
因为某种原因
For whatever reason,

570
00:20:04,873 --> 00:20:07,750
我让自己相信那晚是我的一个转折点
I had let myself believe that this night
would be a turning point,

571
00:20:08,421 --> 00:20:10,051
今晚我的生活
that this was the night my life

572
00:20:10,051 --> 00:20:10,915
我真正的生活
my real life

573
00:20:10,915 --> 00:20:12,353
即将开始
would finally begin.

574
00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:14,079
可笑的是...
The funny thing is...

575
00:20:14,655 --> 00:20:16,285
我没完全错
I wasn't totally wrong.

576
00:20:22,903 --> 00:20:25,780
因为那晚才刚开始
because that night was just beginning.

577
00:20:28,945 --> 00:20:30,888
