00:00:13,008 --> 00:00:14,303
想试试远距离恋爱吗?

8
00:00:14,408 --> 00:00:14,869

远距离恋爱遭透了?我今晚一定要和你谈谈
This long distance thing sucks, huh? And I really need to talk to you tonight.

10
00:00:18,973 --> 00:00:19,856
她要甩了我
She's gonna dump me!

11
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,419
她不会和你分手的, Ted
She's not gonna break up with you, Ted.

12
00:00:21,745 --> 00:00:22,100
喂?

How.I.Met.Your.Mother.
Season 01 Episode 18 

17
00:00:37,712 --> 00:00:42,556
孩子们, 你们的奶奶常说,凌晨两点以后不会有什么好事发生
Kids, your grandma always used to say to me,"Nothing good happens after 2:00 a.m,"

18
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,594
她是对的,凌晨两点就回家睡觉吧
and she was right,when 2:00 a.m. rolls around,just go home and go to sleep.

19
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:48,224
这就是一个好例子:
Case in point:

20
00:00:51,082 --> 00:00:51,734
喂?
Hello?

21

嗨, Ted, 是Robin
Hi, Ted, it's Robin.

22
00:00:54,506 --> 00:00:56,174
我知道已经很晚了, 但是
Listen, I know it's late,but

23
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:57,901
你想过来吗?
do you wanna come over?

24
00:00:59,368 --> 00:01:00,682
让我们回溯一点
Let's back up a little 

25
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:03,252
二十小时前
twenty hours ago

26
00:01:12,315 --> 00:01:13,149
坐下
Sit.

27
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:16,305
好孩子, 好了, 记住
Good boys. Okay. Remember

28
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:18,376
不要碰酒柜
stay out of the liquor cabinet.

29
00:01:21,896 --> 00:01:24,706
...电视播音员的生活是有益的
...So,the life of a television reporter
is very rewarding,

30
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:29,367
我很希望你们能以此作为职业, 谢谢
and I strongly urge you to consider it as a career.Thank you.

31
00:01:32,033 --> 00:01:32,455
说吧
Yeah.

32
00:01:32,781 --> 00:01:34,574
你有未婚夫吗?
Do you have a fiance?

33
00:01:35,658 --> 00:01:38,564
昨天Marshall来了,他们刚学会“未婚夫”这个词
Marshall was here yesterday.They just learned the word "fiance"

34
00:01:38,727 --> 00:01:40,875
不, 我没有未婚夫
No, I don't have a fiance.

35
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,314
那你和谁住在一起?
Then who do you live with?

36
00:01:42,448 --> 00:01:45,373
嗯，事实上, 我有五只狗
Well, actually, I've got five dogs.

37
00:01:45,507 --> 00:01:47,138
你不会孤独吗?
Don't you get lonely?

38
00:01:47,272 --> 00:01:49,382
不, 我有五只狗
No, I've got five dogs.

39
00:01:49,746 --> 00:01:53,017
我奶奶有五只猫, 她觉得孤独
My Grandma has five cats and she gets lonely.

40
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:56,325
但那是猫, 我不是什么可悲的猫女士
Well, yeah, that's cats.I'm not some pathetic cat lady.

41
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:57,822
你奶奶也不是
Not that your grandmother is...

42
00:01:58,963 --> 00:02:00,200
还有人有问题吗?
Does anyone else have a...

43
00:02:00,334 --> 00:02:00,823
说吧
Yes.

44
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:02,195
你是同性恋吗?
Are you a lesbian?

45
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:03,403
不 你是吗?
No, are you? 

46
00:02:03,528 --> 00:02:05,446
一个人住并不代表就是同性恋...
Just because a woman lives alone doesn't mean she's a les...

47
00:02:05,551 --> 00:02:05,906
好了
Okay.

48
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:09,033
让我们鼓掌感谢播音员Robin
Let's have a big hand for Robin the reporter!

49
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,363
好，我们的下一位客人是...
All right, our next guest is another friend...

50
00:02:11,497 --> 00:02:15,027
Robin, 你报道过火车相撞吗?刚才我可见到了.
So, Robin, you ever report on train wrecks
cause I just saw one. What up? 

51
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:16,331
小小地击掌
Tiny five.

52
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:19,429
别看你现在笑的开心
Laugh now. 

53
00:02:19,553 --> 00:02:21,903
这些孩子是魔鬼,他们会把你活吞了
Those kids are monsters.They're gonna eat you alive.

54
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:24,157
他的工作是…
He has a job doing...

55
00:02:24,703 --> 00:02:25,413
你是做什么的？
What do you do?

56
00:02:25,547 --> 00:02:26,650
呵呵, 拜托
(chuckles):Please.

57
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,125
孩子们 我们来乐乐
Kids, let's rap.

58
00:02:29,326 --> 00:02:32,098
你们对我怎么过活大概没什么兴趣
You guys don't give half a brown Crayola
what I do for a living, do you?

59
00:02:32,222 --> 00:02:33,105
对
No.

60
00:02:33,757 --> 00:02:37,018
我知道你们想要什么.
魔法!
No, no. I know what you want. 
Magic!

61
00:02:37,152 --> 00:02:37,996
耶!
Yeah!

62
00:02:39,722 --> 00:02:40,451
喂?
Hello?

63
00:02:40,576 --> 00:02:41,525
为什么她还没打来?
Why hasn't she called yet?

64
00:02:41,621 --> 00:02:43,155
好了, 你这样会把自己弄疯的
Okay, you're making yourself crazy.

65
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:45,284
现在是星期六的晚上, 出去玩玩吧
It's Saturday night.Go out and do something.

66
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,670
我干吗出去呢, 我有女朋友...眼下
No, what's the point of going out?
I got a girlfriend. For now.

67
00:02:49,418 --> 00:02:50,713
而且如果我出去谁看你们的新闻呢?
Besides, if I go out,who's gonna watch the news?

68
00:02:50,847 --> 00:02:51,883
我提供了你们一半的收视率
I'm like half your viewership.

69
00:02:52,017 --> 00:02:54,232
你说我们有两个观众高看我们了
I'm flattered you think we have two viewers.

70
00:02:57,253 --> 00:02:58,107
暂停
And, we're clear.

71
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,102
Scherbatsky, 你有男朋友吗?
So, Scherbatsky. Got a boyfriend?

72
00:03:00,265 --> 00:03:03,036
没有, 为什么今天老遇到这个问题
No, and why does this keep coming up today?

73
00:03:03,295 --> 00:03:05,002
我以为和你打电话的是你男朋友
I just thought that guy you were on the phone with...

74
00:03:05,165 --> 00:03:07,707
哦不, 那是Ted, 只是朋友
What? Oh, no. That was Ted.He's just a friend.

75
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:10,344
我们曾经有可能在一起
I mean, there was this moment where we almost dated,

76
00:03:10,478 --> 00:03:12,607
但是我们想要的完全不同
but we want completely different things.

77
00:03:12,732 --> 00:03:16,319
现在他有个女朋友在德国,他觉得她今晚会打电话来和他分手
Anyway, now he has his girlfriend in Germany and he thinks she's calling to dump him tonight,

78
00:03:16,453 --> 00:03:17,758
但我想不会
but I don't think she is.

79
00:03:17,882 --> 00:03:19,973
还有我们想要的完全不同
And, besides,we want completely different things.

80
00:03:20,587 --> 00:03:22,092
我们应该上床
We should have sex.

81
00:03:22,476 --> 00:03:23,234
什么?!
What?!

82
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,241
为什么不呢?
Why not?

83
00:03:24,442 --> 00:03:26,657
我们都单身, 我们都很迷人
We're both available. We're both
attractive. 

84
00:03:26,763 --> 00:03:29,170
而且我们都擅长此道, 至少我擅长
We're both good at it. At least, I'm good at it.

85
00:03:29,304 --> 00:03:31,664
即使你不好, 也不用担心,我还是会很开心的
And even if you're not, don't worry.
I'll have a good time either way.

86
00:03:32,805 --> 00:03:37,399
我不敢想象你的发胶壳撞击床头板的画面
Well, moving past the horrifying image of your hair helmet clanging against the headboard

87
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:39,815
我不会和同事交往的
I don't get involved with people I work with.

88
00:03:40,343 --> 00:03:42,750
交往? 谁说交往了?
Get involved? Who said get involved?

89
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,263
我只是说我们应该上床,没关系
I'm just saying we should have sex,it could be fun.

90
00:03:45,723 --> 00:03:47,152
上床没关系
Having sex is fun.

91
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:49,243
我的号码, 有时间打给我
Home number. Call me anytime.

92
00:03:49,435 --> 00:03:51,746
今晚有很多本地队伍的行动…
A lot of local teams in action tonight...

93
00:03:54,748 --> 00:03:55,486
伙计们
Hey, guys.

94
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:58,737
想我吗?
Miss me?

95
00:04:02,487 --> 00:04:03,475
我也想你们
I missed you, too.

96
00:04:50,094 --> 00:04:52,012
嗨, Ted, 是Robin
Hi, Ted, it's Robin.

97
00:04:52,827 --> 00:04:54,486
我知道已经很晚了, 但是
Listen, I know it's late,but 

98
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:55,906
你想过来吗?
do you wanna come over?

99
00:05:03,691 --> 00:05:04,602
Ted?
Ted?

100
00:05:04,765 --> 00:05:06,434
哦, 是, 我在
Yeah. Hi, I'm here.

101
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:08,975
你想过来吗?
Do you wanna come over?

102
00:05:09,263 --> 00:05:10,538
为什么? 怎么了?
Why? What's up?

103
00:05:13,444 --> 00:05:17,223
我刚装好了果汁机,准备调点果汁
Well, I just finally set up my new juicer, and I was gonna make some juice.

104
00:05:17,357 --> 00:05:19,371
然后我想, 谁喜欢果汁呢?
And I was like,You know who likes juice? 

105
00:05:19,477 --> 00:05:20,158
Ted!
Ted!

106
00:05:22,584 --> 00:05:23,524
我爱果汁
I love juice.

107
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,024
太好了, 那你想过来做果汁吗?
Great, so you wanna come over and make juice?

108
00:05:27,677 --> 00:05:30,410
凌晨两点以后, 睡觉吧
When it's after 2:00 a.m, just go to sleep

109
00:05:30,506 --> 00:05:34,514
因为凌晨两点以后的决定都是错误的决定
Because the decisions you make after 2:00 a. m.are the wrong decisions

110
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,399
好, 我过来, 我们喝果汁
Okay, sure, I'll come over, we'll...juice.

111
00:05:38,495 --> 00:05:39,492
对, 我们喝果汁
Yes, we'll juice.

112
00:05:39,847 --> 00:05:40,451
好
Okay.

113
00:05:41,036 --> 00:05:42,225
好, 再见
Okay, bye.

114
00:05:43,549 --> 00:05:44,162
再见
Bye.

115
00:05:50,396 --> 00:05:52,420
这没关系, 这完全没关系
This is fine. This is totally fine.

116
00:05:52,688 --> 00:05:53,897
什么没关系?
What's fine?

117
00:05:54,031 --> 00:05:56,409
哦, 我要去一个女孩家做果汁
Oh, I'm going over to this girl's house
to make some juice.

118
00:05:56,812 --> 00:05:58,375
呵呵, 好
Nice.

119
00:05:58,634 --> 00:06:00,035
不, 不是你想的那样
No, it's not like that.

120
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:01,636
我们像朋友那样做果汁
We're juicing as friends.

121
00:06:02,346 --> 00:06:05,798
我有女朋友, 我不会背叛她的
See, I have this girlfriend. I would never cheat on her.

122
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:07,045
她住在德国
She lives in Germany.

123
00:06:07,563 --> 00:06:11,696
四个小时之前她就应该打电话跟我谈一个很严重的问题
See, she was supposed to call me four hours ago to have a serious talk.

124
00:06:11,831 --> 00:06:13,365
但是到现在还没打, 我不知道...
I still haven't heard from her. I don't know...

125
00:06:14,602 --> 00:06:16,262
对不起, 我的麻烦烦到你了
Sorry to bug you with my problems.

126
00:06:16,847 --> 00:06:19,532
我猜出租车司机要变成酒吧招待了
Guess cab drivers are the new bartenders, huh?

127
00:06:20,472 --> 00:06:22,083
说的一点也不错, 孩子
You ain't kidding, kid.

128
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:24,730
来点?
Want a nip?

129
00:06:24,912 --> 00:06:26,360
就在这让我下吧
You could just let me out right up here.

130
00:06:27,828 --> 00:06:28,835
去哪, 伙计
Where are you going to buddy?

131
00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:30,206
公园街八号
Park Slope, Eighth and Eighth.

132
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:35,116
我和上个司机谈到这里为止
Okay, here's where I left off with the last guy.

133
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:38,444
我有女朋友,但我现在要去另一个女孩家
See, I have a girlfriend, but I'm going over
to this other girl's house...

134
00:06:38,578 --> 00:06:39,748
你想知道我会不会难过
And you're wondering if I'd be upset.

135
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:43,038
嗨,Ted 记得我吗? 你的女朋友
Hi,Ted.Remember me? Your girlfriend.

136
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:45,225
轻松点, Robin只是朋友
Okay, relax. Robin's just a friend.

137
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:47,574
对, 你要去做果汁
Right. You're gonna go make some juice.

138
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:50,720
对对, 果汁一点坏处也没有.
事实上
Yes, yes. Juice is perfectly harmless.
In fact,

139
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,727
还很健康呢!
it's healthy.

140
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,709
是吗?那你为什么在想她是不是没穿衣服
Oh, yeah? Then why are you wondering
what she looks like naked?

141
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,177
我没有在想...
I am not...

142
00:06:56,436 --> 00:06:58,785
好吧, 如果我有想,也是你提醒我的
Okay, even if I am wondering that,it's only 'cause you put it in my head.

143
00:06:58,948 --> 00:07:03,705
啊哈, 但我也在你的潜意识里,所以是你自己在想
But I am just a manifestation in your subconscious,,so actually, you put it in your own head.

144
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:04,808
TMD
Damn it!

145
00:07:04,914 --> 00:07:06,084
什么事都不会有的
Nothing's gonna happen.

146
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:06,832
对
Right.

147
00:07:06,966 --> 00:07:09,411
好吧好吧, 你想听听别人的意见?行!
Okay, okay. You want a second opinion? Fine.


148
00:07:14,619 --> 00:07:15,991
嗨, 她打来了吗？
Hey. Did she call?

149
00:07:16,154 --> 00:07:17,726
没有, 我需要点提醒
No. I need a ruling.

150
00:07:19,549 --> 00:07:24,277
也没什么大事情,我现在在去Robin家的路上
I'm... Yeah, this is stupid.It's not even a big deal,but I'm on my way over to Robin's,right now.

151
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:27,700
她有个新的果汁机什么的,我们要试试
She got a new juicer. Whatever.We're gonna test it out.

152
00:07:28,007 --> 00:07:29,436
好, 我再打给你
Let me call you back.

153
00:07:34,481 --> 00:07:37,070
亲爱的, 现在发生点情况
Honey, there's a situation developing.

154
00:07:37,195 --> 00:07:39,257
你记得吗, 你告诉我一个大秘密
Do you remember the huge secret that you told me

155
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:43,256
你本不该说的, 是关于Robin的...
that you weren't supposed to, but you did? The thing about Robin?


156
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:44,954
是说Robin爱Ted的事?
You mean, how Robin's in love with Ted?

157
00:07:45,088 --> 00:07:45,769
什么?
What?

158
00:07:45,903 --> 00:07:47,533
她已经告诉我了, 继续
Yeah. She told me already. Go on.

159
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,075
我是她唯一没有告诉的人?
Wait. So I'm the only one that she didn't tell?

160
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:51,801
她告诉你没有告诉我?
She told you and not me?

161
00:07:51,964 --> 00:07:54,544
我猜她只是认为我是比你更好的朋友
Well, I guess I'm just better friends
with her than you are.

162
00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:57,277
但是我是Ted更好的朋友
Well, I'm better friends with Ted than you are.

163
00:07:57,411 --> 00:07:58,581
你说谎
That is a lie.

164
00:07:58,716 --> 00:07:59,272
没有
It is not a lie.

165
00:07:59,435 --> 00:08:00,250
好 够了
Okay, that's it. 

166
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:07,673
(BOTH SHOUTING)

167
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:10,368
快点接电话啊
Come on. Pick up.

168
00:08:10,598 --> 00:08:13,466
Victoria你在哪? 接电话啊?
Damn it, Victoria. Where are you? Pick up,pick up

169
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,962
纸杯蛋糕?
Cupcake?

170
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,599
不, 谢谢
你在哪? 为什么没有打电话?
No, thanks. 
Where are you? Why haven't you called?


171
00:08:17,734 --> 00:08:20,534
哦 我在外面玩
Oh,I'm out hooking up.

172
00:08:20,659 --> 00:08:22,222
和三个男孩
With three other guys.

173
00:08:22,682 --> 00:08:26,816
或者, 我是个专情的女友,现在正在打给你
Or maybe I'm a devoted girlfriend and I'm calling you right now.

174
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:28,542
对哦, 这我毫不怀疑
Yeah, why do I doubt that?

175
00:08:31,361 --> 00:08:35,888
Ted, 我刚看了新闻:一辆满载硫酸的卡车
Hello?Ted. I just saw the news,and a truck carrying sulfuric acid

176
00:08:36,051 --> 00:08:38,362
在Robin家门前倾覆
overturned right in front of Robin's house.

177
00:08:38,545 --> 00:08:39,811
人行道被融出一个大洞
And it's melting through the sidewalk,

178
00:08:39,945 --> 00:08:41,153
从洞里可以直接看到地狱
You can see straight down into Hell.

179
00:08:41,316 --> 00:08:42,160
太可怕了
It's bad. 

180
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,436
你应该回家, 哥们儿
You should go home, dude.

181
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,044
Marshall没事的, 什么都不会发生
Marshall, it's fine.Nothing's gonna happen.

182
00:08:46,533 --> 00:08:48,490
Ted, 你妈总是怎么说?
Ted, what does your mom always say?

183
00:08:48,941 --> 00:08:51,847
凌晨两点之后不会有好事情发生
Nothing good ever... Nothing good ever happens after 2:00 a.m.


184
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:53,803
回家! 现在喝果汁太晚了
Go home! It's too late for juice.

185
00:08:53,937 --> 00:08:57,131
Robin和我只是朋友,她对我没有那方面的意思
Dude, Robin and I are just friends.
She doesn't even like me that way.

186
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:00,238
不, 她有,她告诉我她喜欢你
Yes, she does! She likes you. She told me.

187
00:09:01,025 --> 00:09:01,562
什么?
What?

188
00:09:01,725 --> 00:09:04,103
这是秘密,所以不要告诉她我告诉你的
It's a big secret. So don't tell her I told you

189
00:09:04,391 --> 00:09:07,863
但现在她很脆弱,而你也有女朋友
but she's very vulnerable right now,and you have a girlfriend. 

190
00:09:08,054 --> 00:09:09,522
回家 Ted
Go home, Ted.

191
00:09:10,078 --> 00:09:11,277
她喜欢我?
She likes me?

192
00:09:11,411 --> 00:09:15,544
是的!
所以你现在过去绝对是个坏主意
Yes!
So you see why it would be a very bad idea for you to go up there

193
00:09:15,717 --> 00:09:17,290
回家 Ted
Go home, Ted

194
00:09:18,134 --> 00:09:19,534
她喜欢我?
She likes me?

195
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,519
回家 Ted
Go home, Ted.

196
00:09:22,143 --> 00:09:26,190
好, 家里见
You're right, I'll...I'll see you at home.

197
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:29,614
好了, 他回家了
Good. He's going home.

198
00:09:29,872 --> 00:09:31,628
他不会回家的
He is so not going home.

199
00:09:31,762 --> 00:09:33,622
真不相信你告诉他了
I cannot believe you just told him that.

200
00:09:33,785 --> 00:09:34,629
你是什么意思?
What do you mean?

201
00:09:34,764 --> 00:09:35,905
Lily 这就是你的话的意思：
Lily, here's what you just said,

202
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,890
Ted, 不管你去哪, 别去那
Ted, whatever you do,don't go up there.

203
00:09:38,024 --> 00:09:40,499
因为那里有个漂亮女孩想和你上床
There's a beautiful girl who wants to have sex with you.

204
00:09:40,633 --> 00:09:43,529
而且她还会为你准备美味的果汁
And then she's gonna make you some delicious juice!

205
00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:47,576
不, 他不会去的, 他有理性
No. He's not going up there.
He has more sense than that.

206
00:09:48,161 --> 00:09:50,377
我确实有理性
I did have more sense than that

207
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:51,787
不用找了.谢谢
Keep the change. Thanks.

208
00:09:52,046 --> 00:09:55,469
但是凌晨两点以后 我的理性都睡着了
But after 2：a.m.my good sense was sound asleep

209
00:10:05,944 --> 00:10:07,862
你要这么做? 你要进去?
So, you're doing this?
You're going up there?

210
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:09,080
你要拦我?
You want to get out of the way?

211
00:10:09,473 --> 00:10:10,777
我没有拦你
I'm not in the way.

212
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,194
你知道, 如果你打给我,我一定...
You know, if you had just called me, I...

213
00:10:20,176 --> 00:10:20,569
-嗨！
-嘿.
-Hi!
-Hey.

214
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:24,540
我带了蔬菜来,有胡萝卜,豆子
I got some vegetables. I got carrots.
I got beets.

215
00:10:24,674 --> 00:10:25,815
我们就喝酒吧
Or we could just drink wine.

216
00:10:26,141 --> 00:10:27,350
为什么不呢?
Why not? 

217
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:28,884
这是我说的最蠢的话
Wow, that's the stupidest thing I ever said.

218
00:10:31,752 --> 00:10:33,708
-用大杯
-好的
-Make it a big glass. 
-Sure.

219
00:10:35,214 --> 00:10:36,451
过的怎么样?
So, how's it hanging?

220
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:43,183
你有没有这样过,也没什么发生
Haven't you ever had one of those days where nothing at all that monumental happens,

221
00:10:43,346 --> 00:10:49,475
但是你忽然不知道你自己是谁,你在过什么样的生活?
but, by the end of it, you have no idea who you are anymore,what the hell you're doing with your life?

222
00:10:49,647 --> 00:10:51,268
你有这样吗?
Do you ever have one of those days?

223
00:10:51,632 --> 00:10:52,937
每周一次
About once a week.

224
00:10:53,618 --> 00:10:56,236
我不知道, 只是难熬的一天
I don't know. It was just a rough day,

225
00:10:56,428 --> 00:10:59,362
在这一天结束的时候，我唯一想见的就是你
and the only person I wanted to see
at the end of it was you.

226
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:05,874
你女朋友的电话怎么说了?
So, how was the big phone call with your girlfriend?

227
00:11:06,181 --> 00:11:08,981
时针指向两点, 睡觉吧
When the clock strikes two，just go to sleep

228
00:11:10,027 --> 00:11:11,360
我们分手了
We broke up.

229
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:12,962
什么?
What?

230
00:11:13,096 --> 00:11:16,059
对, 她终于打来了, 我们谈了一会
Yeah. Yeah. She finally called.

231
00:11:16,261 --> 00:11:18,150
说了说远距离恋爱有多难,
We talked for a while.How hard long distance is,

232
00:11:18,802 --> 00:11:20,001
然后，她甩了我
and then she dumped me.

233
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:25,995
Ted我很遗憾，这太遭了, 我感觉遭透了
Ted, I'm so sorry. That's just terrible. I feel awful.

234
00:11:27,107 --> 00:11:28,373
你在笑
You're smiling.

235
00:11:28,584 --> 00:11:29,457
是吗?
Am I? 

236
00:11:29,591 --> 00:11:30,704
我没有
No, I'm not.

237
00:11:31,193 --> 00:11:33,926
我是播新闻的, 这是职业笑容
Well, I'm a news anchor. Smiling is a part of the job.

238
00:11:34,156 --> 00:11:36,890
今天的雪崩造成数千人丧生
Thousands died in a tragic avalanche today.

239
00:11:37,053 --> 00:11:37,839
看到了?
See?

240
00:11:40,122 --> 00:11:41,224
你也在笑
You're smiling, too.

241
00:11:43,843 --> 00:11:47,420
对, 我不知道这是怎么回事
Yeah. I have no idea what that's all about.

242
00:11:54,852 --> 00:11:56,809
这个韩国猫王有多酷?
How much does Korean Elvis rock?

243
00:11:56,972 --> 00:11:59,120
我自己回答: 无限
I'll answer that. Infinity.

244
00:11:59,715 --> 00:12:02,122
他无限的酷
He rocks infinity.

245
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:04,366
好了, 该睡觉了
Okay, it's time for bed.

246
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,294
什么? 不! 才2:30
What? No. It's 2:30.

247
00:12:06,514 --> 00:12:09,065
凌晨两点之后不会有好事情发生
And nothing good ever happens after 2:00 a.m.

248
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,760
我发现, 在我的人生旅程
You know, I have found in my travels

249
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:16,038
所有好的事情都发生在凌晨两点之后
that all the best things in life happen after 2:00 a.m.

250
00:12:16,162 --> 00:12:18,445
回头想想, 我生命中最美妙的故事
When I look back，at the best stories of my life,

251
00:12:18,579 --> 00:12:19,797
"自由钟事件"
the Liberty Bell incident, 

252
00:12:20,027 --> 00:12:22,118
"俄国大使馆事件"
the little scrape I got in at the Russian embassy

253
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:23,662
"差点就成了的四人行"
the almost four-way.

254
00:12:23,835 --> 00:12:26,098
-你从来没四人行，
-我说了差点...
-好，好
-You never had a four-way.
-I said "almost"!
-Well, all right.
 
255
00:12:26,817 --> 00:12:29,061
所有的事都是凌晨两点后发生的
All those things happened after 2:00 a.m.

256
00:12:29,205 --> 00:12:31,507
因为凌晨两点以后一切才会变的
Because after 2:00 a.m. is when things get,

257
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:35,218
观众们和我一起说: 传奇性的!
audience, say it with me, legendary!

258
00:12:35,775 --> 00:12:36,724
我要走了
We going home.

259
00:12:36,887 --> 00:12:39,496
你说什么? 理论很有意思, Barney，但是我们要证明.
What's that? "Interesting theory, Barney, "but I'll need some proof." Okay.

260
00:12:43,246 --> 00:12:47,676
韩国猫王, 想和我和我的朋友喝一杯吗?
Korean Elvis. How would you like
to have a drink with me and my friends?

261
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:48,942
摇滚吧
Rock 'n' roll.

262
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,174
开始了
And it begins.

263
00:12:55,464 --> 00:12:58,370
嘿, 我买了个新手机,和你的一样,看.
So,hey.I got a new phone. Same as yours. Look.

264
00:12:58,533 --> 00:13:00,422
哦 是啊, 你喜欢吗?
Oh, yeah, do you like it?

265
00:13:01,266 --> 00:13:02,791
对 对
Yeah.Yeah.

266
00:13:03,443 --> 00:13:04,910
这个手指略有微辞
This is some solid small talk.

267
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,507
我还有个手机, 也不错
I had that other phone, and it was good,

268
00:13:08,698 --> 00:13:10,914
但是一直以来, 部分的我
but I think, the whole time,a little part of me

269
00:13:11,595 --> 00:13:13,263
想换这只手机代替那只
wanted this phone instead.

270
00:13:13,647 --> 00:13:14,453
因为这只
This phone

271
00:13:16,217 --> 00:13:17,224
有对的感觉
feels right.

272
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,025
哇 奇怪
Oh, wow. Weird.

273
00:13:20,897 --> 00:13:21,655
对
Yeah, 

274
00:13:22,403 --> 00:13:23,602
我想私下接
I should probably take this.

275
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,530
我在这等你
I'll be here.

276
00:13:31,322 --> 00:13:31,974
喂?
Hello?

277
00:13:32,137 --> 00:13:33,998
Ted, 这里是NKE电台
Ted. This is your main man N.K.E.

278
00:13:34,238 --> 00:13:37,038
我要你尽快服用安眠药, 可以吗?
I want you to shake your tail feather
down here ASAP. You dig?

279
00:13:37,738 --> 00:13:38,649
对不起
Okay. Sorry about that.

280
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,443
刚才那是韩国猫王?
Who... Was that Korean Elvis?

281
00:13:40,606 --> 00:13:42,562
我以后再解释, 我们正去MacLaren酒吧.
I'll explain later.Hey, we're heading down to MacLaren's.

282
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:44,653
事实上
Actually

283
00:13:45,535 --> 00:13:48,853
我在Robin家,对,而且,
I'm at Robin's.Yeah, and,um...

284
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:54,617
我做了点坏事,我刚骗她说我和Victoria分手了
I might have done something bad.I just lied and told her I broke up with Victoria.

285
00:13:55,998 --> 00:14:00,861
Ted我不想在韩国猫王面前说脏话,但是你他-Beep-的要做什么!
Ted, I don't want to swear in front of Korean Elvis,but what the bleep are you doing, dude?

286
00:14:01,062 --> 00:14:03,814
我还能怎么样?是Robin啊! Victoria很好
What do you expect from me? It's Robin! Victoria's great, 

287
00:14:04,016 --> 00:14:05,579
但这是Robin啊!
but it's Robin!

288
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,523
我已经决定, 我要和Victoria分手
I've made up my mind,I'm gonna end it with Victoria.

289
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:09,434
要分手?
Gonna?

290
00:14:09,597 --> 00:14:10,931
对, 明天第一件事
Yes. First thing tomorrow.

291
00:14:11,094 --> 00:14:15,812
但是现在, 凌晨两点四十五
Okay, but as of right now, at 2:45 a.m. 

292
00:14:15,975 --> 00:14:17,701
你还是有女朋友的
You still have a girlfriend.

293
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,281
Ted我爱你, 我爱Robin
Ted, I love you. I love Robin.

294
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:22,295
但是如果你现在这么做
But if you do this right now,

295
00:14:22,497 --> 00:14:25,786
你们俩的未来都将是建立在一个谎言的基础上
your entire future with her will be built on a crime!

296
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:28,941
回家吧, Ted, 不要做错事
Just go home, Ted,Don't do this the wrong way!

297
00:14:29,267 --> 00:14:30,802
我讨厌你总是对的
I hate how you're always right.

298
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:33,084
这是我最好的也是最烦人的一次特征.
It's my best and most annoying trait.

299
00:14:36,422 --> 00:14:37,918
好吧, 我回家, 一会见
Okay. I'm coming home. I'll see you soon.

300
00:14:42,732 --> 00:14:43,768
- 嘿.
- 嘿.
- Hey.
- Hey.

301
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,723
我应该走了, 很晚了
I should probably get going.It's pretty late.

302
00:14:55,804 --> 00:14:59,055
- 对不起, 我
- 不, 我明白, 没关系
- I'm sorry. I...
- Oh, no. I understand. It's fine. Yeah.

303
00:15:02,345 --> 00:15:03,486
明天我能打电话给你吗?
Can I call you tomorrow?

304
00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:05,327
当然 当然 明天打给我
Totally.Totally. Call me tomorrow.

305
00:15:05,462 --> 00:15:06,210
好
Okay.

306
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,041
- 晚安Robin
- 晚安Ted
- Good night, Robin.
- Good night, Ted.

307
00:15:36,783 --> 00:15:38,998
噢,老天, 我们在亲热?
Oh, my God! We're making out.

308
00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:42,211
是吗，是吗，是吗!这太疯狂了.
Right!This is crazy.Right! Right!

309
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,153
我们应该进房间吗?
Should we go to my room?

310
00:15:46,354 --> 00:15:47,754
那有五只狗, 但是
I mean, there's five dogs in there, but...

311
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:48,618
好
Yeah.

312
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:49,989
-好吗?
-好.
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

313
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:57,738
我...我得去下洗手间,很快
I just, I have to run to the bathroom.
Real quick.

314
00:15:59,301 --> 00:16:00,279
好.
Okay.

315
00:16:13,437 --> 00:16:14,895
别再这样了
Stop doing that!

316
00:16:15,193 --> 00:16:16,267
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

317
00:16:17,178 --> 00:16:19,297
我要打电话给你, 我们要分手
I'm calling you. We're breaking up.

318
00:16:19,403 --> 00:16:20,506
我现在就要这么做
I'm doing this right now.

319
00:16:20,602 --> 00:16:22,174
走出这个洗手间的时候就是单身了
I'm coming out of this bathroom a single man.

320
00:16:22,596 --> 00:16:26,998
好, 但是Ted,你认为我们的谈话要花多长时间?
Okay. Say, Ted, how long do you think
that conversation's gonna be?

321
00:16:27,133 --> 00:16:28,763
和一般尿尿的时间一样?
Length of an average pee? 

322
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:31,429
不, 我们的电话至少要20分钟
No. We're gonna be on the phone for at least 20 minutes.

323
00:16:31,563 --> 00:16:34,335
Robin就在外面.她会认为你在这里打...
Robin's out there.She's gonna think
you're in here taking a massive...

324
00:16:34,498 --> 00:16:36,685
你要我怎么做? 人们会分手
What do you want from me?People break up. 

325
00:16:36,819 --> 00:16:38,133
这会发生
It happens.

326
00:16:38,727 --> 00:16:39,965
但不是这样分手
Not like this.

327
00:16:40,128 --> 00:16:43,647
不是在你马上要和她做爱的女孩的洗手间
Not from the bathroom of the girl that you're about to sleep with.

328
00:16:44,491 --> 00:16:46,457
这是不太理想
It's not ideal.

329
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:48,855
再说酒吧里
Meanwhile, back at the bar

330
00:16:48,951 --> 00:16:52,662
Barney还想证明凌晨两点后可能发生好事
Barney was still trying to prove that
good things can happen after 2:00 a.m.

331
00:16:52,796 --> 00:16:58,886
拜托Lily!有多少女人能享受韩国猫王为她单独唱小曲
Come on, Lily! How many women can say they've been personally serenaded by Korean Elvis?

332
00:17:00,852 --> 00:17:03,125
我想他刚刚向我吐口水了
I think he just spat on me.

333
00:17:03,221 --> 00:17:05,648
Barney你尝试过了,这很棒, 我们要走了
Barney,you tried.I think that's great.
But we're going.

334
00:17:05,744 --> 00:17:06,779
哦 不 不 拜托
No. No, come on!

335
00:17:06,885 --> 00:17:07,374
要!
Yes!

336
00:17:07,508 --> 00:17:13,282
伙计我们还没看到神奇的事,我们才看到“神”, 还有“奇”呢
Dude.We haven't hit legendary yet."We're only at the "le." We still got the "gen," the "da," the "ry.

337
00:17:13,406 --> 00:17:18,096
如果我们已经看到“神”, 不如回家吧
（legendry和let's go home都以le开头）
Okay, if we're at the "le," then I say we follow it up with a "t's go home."

338
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:22,373
哇,你受到打击了
Oh, wow! You just got burned.Phonics style!

339
00:17:22,498 --> 00:17:27,322
宝贝宝贝 不要走,再跳支舞吧
No, no, no, no. Baby, baby, baby, don't go. Just one dance, huh?

340
00:17:27,418 --> 00:17:28,636
好了, 我是认真的
Okay, seriously.

341
00:17:29,518 --> 00:17:31,014
我知道你想要什么
Hey, I know what you like.

342
00:17:38,102 --> 00:17:39,991
于是, Barney是对的
And so, Barney was right

343
00:17:40,221 --> 00:17:41,391
这一夜是传奇性的
The night was legendary

344
00:17:41,525 --> 00:17:45,275
这后来被大家称为Lily踢韩国猫王蛋蛋的一夜
It would come to be known as the time Lily kicked Korean Elvis in the nards

345
00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:49,284
你们记得Lily踢韩国猫王蛋蛋的那天?
Hey, you guys remember that time that Lily kicked Korean Elvis in the nards?

346
00:17:51,634 --> 00:17:54,885
你是对的,我欠你一个真正的分手电话
You're right. You're right. I owe you a real breakup call.

347
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:56,352
我明早打给你
I'll call you tomorrow.

348
00:17:56,525 --> 00:17:58,452
好, 那你回家吗?
Good. So, you're gonna go home?

349
00:17:59,824 --> 00:18:01,090
为什么我一定要回家?
Why should I have to go home?

350
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:05,242
有可能Robin就是我以后要娶的女人
You know, there's every chance Robin's the woman I'm gonna marry.

351
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:05,895
Ted
Ted.

352
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,045
这有可能!
It could happen!

353
00:18:07,247 --> 00:18:11,121
五十年之后这又会有什么关系,只是跳过一夜
And so, really, what's it gonna matter
in 50 years if I jump the gun by one night?

354
00:18:11,447 --> 00:18:13,730
我知道这不符合道德, 但...
Look,I know this is a moral gray area, but...

355
00:18:15,188 --> 00:18:16,502
是Robin啊
it's Robin.

356
00:18:17,461 --> 00:18:20,750
我精疲力竭了,我精疲力竭是因为要装作不爱她
And I'm exhausted. I am. I'm exhausted from pretending I'm not in love with her.

357
00:18:20,884 --> 00:18:22,448
我想这是个充分的理由
I think that makes this okay.

358
00:18:22,543 --> 00:18:24,759
得了, 你只是想和她上床
Oh, please. You just want to get laid!

359
00:18:25,181 --> 00:18:27,367
是的, 我是, 你说对了
Yes, I do. You got me.

360
00:18:27,463 --> 00:18:29,947
这就是现在我想要的, 那又如何?
That is exactly what I want right now.
And so what?

361
00:18:30,082 --> 00:18:32,297
我想要, 她也想要, 这事发生了
I want this. She wants this.

362
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:34,656
如果你不乐意, 不要在德国
It's happening. And if you have a problem
with it, don't be in Germany!

363
00:18:35,701 --> 00:18:37,591
假装和你谈话很愉快
It's been nice pretending to talk to you.

364
00:18:37,821 --> 00:18:39,605
谢谢你没有打电话给我, 晚安
Thanks for not calling me and good night.

365
00:18:41,437 --> 00:18:42,798
那不是你的电话
That's not your phone.

366
00:18:44,314 --> 00:18:45,580
这不是我的电话
This isn't my phone.

367
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,962
好的, 再见
Okay. Bye.

368
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,201
我以为是我的, 所以接了
I thought it was mine, so I answered it.

369
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:00,282
是谁?
Was it...

370
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:01,682
是你女朋友
It was your girlfriend.

371
00:19:02,986 --> 00:19:04,521
你可能想打回去给她
You might want to call her back.

372
00:19:25,792 --> 00:19:28,765
我在出租车上打给了Victoria,我们分手了
I called Victoria from the cab,and we broke up.

373
00:19:30,194 --> 00:19:30,846
对
Yes, I'm...

374
00:19:31,431 --> 00:19:33,292
现在你们知道了, 孩子们
And there you have it, kids

375
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,910
我做过的最愚蠢的事情
The stupidest thing I've ever done

376
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:39,737
在一夜我伤害了两个我最在乎的人
In one night, I managed to hurt two people I cared about

377
00:19:40,101 --> 00:19:42,930
如果我听妈妈的话, 这都不会发生
And none of it would've happened if I had just listened to my mom

378
00:19:53,623 --> 00:19:55,772
所以我想,我们要从中吸取的教训是
So, I guess if there's a lesson to be learned here, it's this

379
00:19:57,412 --> 00:19:58,908
凌晨两点以后
when it's after 2:00 a.m.

380
00:19:59,876 --> 00:20:01,219
睡觉吧
just go to sleep

381
00:20:21,277 --> 00:20:22,927
