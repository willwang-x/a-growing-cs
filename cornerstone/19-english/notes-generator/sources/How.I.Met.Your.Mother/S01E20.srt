老爸老妈的浪漫史
第一季 第二十集
How.I.Met.Your.Mother
Season 01 Episode 20

4
00:00:16,567 --> 00:00:17,142
孩子们
Kids,

5
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:19,923
大约在Lily阿姨和Marshall叔叔
订婚八个月的时候
about eight months into Aunt Lily
and Uncle Marshall's engagement,

6
00:00:19,923 --> 00:00:23,088
发生了件紧急情况
there occurred a game-changing emergency.

7
00:00:23,088 --> 00:00:24,335
Van Smoot现在可以预定
Van Smoot is available.

8
00:00:24,335 --> 00:00:25,582
噢, 我的上帝!
Oh,my god!

9
00:00:25,582 --> 00:00:28,842
Van Smoot是位于哈得孙河上的很棒的公寓
Van Smoot house was a gorgeous
mansion right on the Hudson River.

10
00:00:28,842 --> 00:00:31,240
它可以满足Marshall和Lily婚礼所有的需求
It had everything Marshall and
Lily wanted for their wedding,

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,774
但它从来没有空置
but it was never available.

12
00:00:32,774 --> 00:00:35,268
然后, 突然, 可以预定了
And then,suddenly,it was.

13
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:37,282
两个月后有一个预定被取消了
There was a cancellation two months from now.

14
00:00:37,282 --> 00:00:39,488
你想在两个月内举行婚礼?
You want to have our wedding in two months?

15
00:00:39,488 --> 00:00:41,022
不 这不可能
No. It's impossible.

16
00:00:41,022 --> 00:00:42,461
是Van Smoot, Lily
It's Van Smoot,Lily.

17
00:00:42,461 --> 00:00:43,995
这是我们的梦!
It's the dream!

18
00:00:43,995 --> 00:00:45,434
不, 没有足够的时间
No,there's just not enough time.

19
00:00:45,434 --> 00:00:46,681
没有可能...
There's no way...

20
00:00:47,544 --> 00:00:48,886
迷你呕吐
Mini-vomit.

21
00:00:48,886 --> 00:00:49,845
好吧, 听着, 听着
Okay,look,look,look.

22
00:00:49,845 --> 00:00:50,900
我知道这太突然了
I know that it's sudden,

23
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,435
但想想 如果我们不把握机会
but check it.If we don't take this,

24
00:00:52,435 --> 00:00:54,641
猜谁会去交定金
guess who's on their way with a deposit check.

25
00:00:54,641 --> 00:00:56,271
Todd和Valerie?
Todd and Valerie?

26
00:00:58,189 --> 00:00:59,340
当你计划婚礼时
When you're planning a wedding,

27
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,080
总有一对品味相近的新人走快你一步
there's always one couple with similar taste
that seems to be one step ahead of you.

28
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,765
Todd和Valerie就是
Todd and Valerie were that couple.

29
00:01:06,245 --> 00:01:07,779
我们得做决定
We got to make a decision.

30
00:01:07,779 --> 00:01:09,698
Todd和Valerie开始行动了
Todd and Valerie are in motion.

31
00:01:11,712 --> 00:01:13,438
Van Smoot!
Van Smoot!

32
00:01:13,821 --> 00:01:15,452
孩子们, 注意色彩!
Kids,color!

33
00:01:18,808 --> 00:01:19,959
加油, 宝贝
Come on,baby.

34
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:21,973
加油, 加油
Come on,come on,come on.

35
00:01:34,441 --> 00:01:36,263
好啊, Marshall
hello,Marshall.

36
00:01:36,551 --> 00:01:37,510
Lily
Lily.

37
00:01:38,085 --> 00:01:39,236
Todd
Todd.

38
00:01:39,907 --> 00:01:41,250
Valerie
Valerie.

39
00:01:42,593 --> 00:01:43,839
楼梯
Stairs.

40
00:01:46,716 --> 00:01:48,347
我不敢相信
I can't believe it.

41
00:01:48,347 --> 00:01:50,553
我们定到了Van Smoot公寓
We got Van Smoot house.

42
00:01:50,553 --> 00:01:52,087
开始了
It is on.

43
00:01:52,087 --> 00:01:52,950
拉开序幕!
It is on!

44
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,731
就象前苏联共和国阿塞拜疆
Like the Former Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan.

45
00:01:56,595 --> 00:01:57,937
- 什么?
- 你是个奇迹
- What?
- You're a wonder.

46
00:01:57,937 --> 00:01:59,759
你们两个月内就要举行婚礼了
You guys are getting married in two months.

47
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,102
要怎么把一切办妥?
How are you going to get everything done?

48
00:02:01,102 --> 00:02:02,349
分工
Division of labor.

49
00:02:02,349 --> 00:02:03,787
每个人都有任务
Everyone's got a job to do,

50
00:02:03,787 --> 00:02:04,651
听好
so listen up.

51
00:02:04,651 --> 00:02:07,240
Robin, 你和Ted去定花
Okay,Robin,you and Ted go to the florist.

52
00:02:08,966 --> 00:02:10,501
Robin一直生我气自从那晚
Robin had been mad at me since the night

53
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:14,433
我轻微的夸大了我"没有女朋友"
I slightly exaggerated my not-having
-a-girlfriend-ness.

54
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:15,296
那是...?
Was it...?

55
00:02:15,296 --> 00:02:16,830
是你女朋友
It was your girlfriend.

56
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:19,516
你可能想给她回电
You might want to call her back.

57
00:02:19,899 --> 00:02:21,626
或者, 事实上
Or,actually,

58
00:02:21,626 --> 00:02:23,735
Robin, 你去联系花商?
Robin,why don't you go to the florist?

59
00:02:23,735 --> 00:02:24,599
然后,Ted
And,Ted,

60
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,284
我可以利用你建筑上敏锐的眼光...
I could use your keen architectural eye on...

61
00:02:27,284 --> 00:02:29,394
来整理邀请函
on the invitations.

62
00:02:29,394 --> 00:02:32,079
哇,这真是尴尬啊, Lil
Wow,That was really awkward,Lil.

63
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:34,189
仍然
And still.

64
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:36,874
现在气氛仍然很尴尬
It's still really awkward right now.

65
00:02:38,505 --> 00:02:39,176
嘿, 那我呢?
Hey,what about me?

66
00:02:39,176 --> 00:02:39,751
我的工作是什么?
What's my job?

67
00:02:39,751 --> 00:02:40,615
我要做什么?
What do I get to do?

68
00:02:40,615 --> 00:02:42,149
好吧, 你的工作很简单
Okay,your job is very simple.

69
00:02:42,149 --> 00:02:43,683
在婚礼上
At the wedding,

70
00:02:43,683 --> 00:02:47,424
不要和任何与我沾亲的人睡觉
do not sleep with anyone even remotely related to me.

71
00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:51,356
Lil, 你知道我不能保证这个
Lil,you know I can't promise that.

72
00:02:57,973 --> 00:02:59,508
看她多可爱
Look how cute she looks.

73
00:02:59,508 --> 00:03:00,946
累坏了
All tuckered out.

74
00:03:02,385 --> 00:03:03,631
嘿, 宝贝
Hey,babe.

75
00:03:04,207 --> 00:03:05,645
嘿, 小家伙
Hey,little one.

76
00:03:05,645 --> 00:03:06,604
嘿, 百合花瓣
Hey,little sparrow.

77
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:07,564
糟糕!
Crap!

78
00:03:07,564 --> 00:03:08,331
乐队!
Band!

79
00:03:08,331 --> 00:03:09,578
我们忘了乐队!
We forgot a band!

80
00:03:09,578 --> 00:03:13,030
没有乐队的婚礼
只听到大家吃东西的声音
It's just gonna be silence and
then people chewing.

81
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,565
宝贝, 别担心
Baby,don't worry about it.

82
00:03:14,565 --> 00:03:16,579
我找了88乐队!
I called the 88!

83
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:17,250
谁?
Who?

84
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,209
88乐队
The 88.

85
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:19,552
一个很棒的乐队
They're this awesome band.

86
00:03:19,552 --> 00:03:20,702
他们在我法律评论派对上表演过
They played my law review party.

87
00:03:20,702 --> 00:03:21,949
他们在摇滚
They were found guilty.

88
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:23,963
三项审判上有罪
On three counts of rocking.

89
00:03:23,963 --> 00:03:25,785
我两个月前在我表亲Bonzo的婚礼上见过他们
I saw them two months ago at my cousin Bonzo's wedding,

90
00:03:25,785 --> 00:03:26,840
他们不错
they were great.

91
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,621
Led Zeppelin乐队的John "Bonzo" Bonham?
(著名重金属摇滚乐队)
John "bonzo" bonham from Led Zeppelin?

92
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:30,772
是的, Lily, 我的表亲
Yes,Lily,my cousin,

93
00:03:30,772 --> 00:03:31,827
Led Zeppelin的鼓手
the drummer from Led Zeppelin,

94
00:03:31,827 --> 00:03:32,978
1980去世的那个
who died in 1980,

95
00:03:32,978 --> 00:03:35,088
两个月前结婚了
got married two months ago.

96
00:03:35,472 --> 00:03:35,951
听着, 我...
Look,I...

97
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:38,541
不能请一个从来没见过的乐队
I can't sign off on a band I've never even seen.

98
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,555
我们甚至不知道他们能不能演奏我们的歌
We... we don't even know if they can play our song.

99
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:43,048
他们得先过来面试
They're... they're going to have to come over here and audition.

100
00:03:43,048 --> 00:03:44,870
宝贝, 88乐队不面试
Baby,the 88 don't audition.

101
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,788
他们就像婚礼乐队之王
They're,like,the wiggles of wedding bands.

102
00:03:47,747 --> 00:03:48,227
那...
then...

103
00:03:48,227 --> 00:03:49,665
我不干
I have to say no.

104
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:53,885
宝贝, 他们只在周一前接受预约
Baby,they're only holding the date until Monday.

105
00:03:53,885 --> 00:03:56,379
他们这周会在哪演出吗?
are they playing anywhere this weekend?

106
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,393
我去查查他们的网站
Let me check their website.

107
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,982
怎么?
What?

108
00:04:00,982 --> 00:04:03,092
Lily, 你对乐队的事有点紧张了
Lily,you're being a wee bit intense
about this band thing.

109
00:04:03,092 --> 00:04:04,531
紧张?
Intense?

110
00:04:04,531 --> 00:04:08,654
我要在九周内准备一个200人参加的婚礼
I have a wedding to plan in nine weeks for 200 people.

111
00:04:08,654 --> 00:04:11,627
就算是恐龙也会被我头撞飞
Even if a dinosaur should poke his head out of my butt

112
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:13,354
然后撞烂咖啡桌
and consume this coffee table,

113
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:15,559
你得全力支持我, 好不?
I need you to roll with it,okay?

114
00:04:17,573 --> 00:04:18,532
伙计们!
Guys!

115
00:04:18,532 --> 00:04:20,546
我刚尝到了很棒的包办伙食
I just tasted an amazing caterer.

116
00:04:20,546 --> 00:04:22,177
我们有伙食承办人了
We already have a caterer.

117
00:04:22,177 --> 00:04:24,095
噢, 对了 你要结婚了
Oh,right.You're getting married.

118
00:04:24,095 --> 00:04:25,533
你看我干的?
You see what I did there?

119
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:26,684
拿个...
Took A...

120
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:32,534
88乐队明天要在新泽西一个高中毕业舞会上演出
it looks like the 88 are playing at a high school prom in New Jersey tomorrow.

121
00:04:32,534 --> 00:04:33,302
毕业舞会?
A prom?

122
00:04:33,302 --> 00:04:34,740
我们可以去吗?
Can... can we go to that?

123
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,699
我们给那个高中打个电话
we'll just call the high school,

124
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:37,617
他们会让我们站在后面看的
they'll let us stand in the back and watch.

125
00:04:39,152 --> 00:04:40,590
[11秒后]
耶，不, 他们不干
Yeah,no,they won't.

126
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,262
为什么不行?
Why not?

127
00:04:41,262 --> 00:04:42,892
因为我们不是高中生
Cause it turns out we're not in high school.

128
00:04:42,892 --> 00:04:44,618
别担心, 我们可以溜进去
No sweat,we'll just sneak in.

129
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,536
我们不会溜进高中毕业舞会
We're not sneaking in to a high school prom.

130
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,496
不, 我们会
Yes,we are.

131
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:48,550
这是唯一的办法了
It's the only way.

132
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,181
你要用Barney的主意吗?
You're getting on board with Barney's idea?

133
00:04:50,181 --> 00:04:52,003
天, 你真太着急了
Man,you really have snapped.

134
00:04:52,003 --> 00:04:53,825
离婚礼只有九周了
It's nine weeks till the wedding.

135
00:04:53,825 --> 00:04:54,401
基于这点
At this point,

136
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:57,086
我会对任何事说yes
I'd say yes to just about anything.

137
00:04:57,086 --> 00:04:58,524
不, Barney
no,Barney.

138
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,290
所以Lily阿姨开始计划溜进毕业舞会
And so, Aunt Lily hatched the plan to crash a prom,

139
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,345
我和你一起
I'll go with you.

140
00:05:05,345 --> 00:05:06,208
真的吗?
Really?

141
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,263
我从来没去过我的毕业舞会
I never got to go to my prom.

142
00:05:07,263 --> 00:05:09,949
春天总有国家曲棍球比赛
We always had field hockey nationals 
in the spring.

143
00:05:11,004 --> 00:05:12,059
女同性恋
lesbian.

144
00:05:12,826 --> 00:05:15,032
咳嗽应该掩盖住"女同性恋"
The cough is supposed to cover the "lesbian."

145
00:05:15,032 --> 00:05:17,813
不, 我在尝试和咳嗽分开来的新方法
No,I'm trying to start a thing where the cough is separate.

146
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,170
你们觉得我们看起来够年轻溜进高中吗?
Do you think we look young enough
to blend in at a high school?

147
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,512
拜托, 我永远不会变老
Please,I'm ageless,

148
00:05:22,512 --> 00:05:23,855
Scherbotsky只是需要充足的睡眠
Scherbotsky just needs a good night's sleep,

149
00:05:23,855 --> 00:05:26,444
你的身材还是凹凸有致
and you've got "statutory" written all over your body.

150
00:05:27,691 --> 00:05:28,746
嘿, 为什么不我们都去?
Hey,why don't we all go?

151
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:29,417
不知道
I don't know

152
00:05:29,417 --> 00:05:30,760
人多可能不好溜进去
more people might be harder to sneak in.

153
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,966
我们可不想把Lily的事情搞砸
We don't want to mess things up for Lily.

154
00:05:33,829 --> 00:05:34,884
耶, 你是对的
Yeah,you're right.

155
00:05:34,884 --> 00:05:36,035
另外, 我和Marshall计划
Besides,Marshall and I have been planning

156
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:37,857
婚礼前的男士单身之夜
on having a guy's night out before the wedding.

157
00:05:37,857 --> 00:05:39,295
为什么不干脆明晚呢?
Why don't we just make it tomorrow night?

158
00:05:39,295 --> 00:05:40,542
听起来很棒
Sounds awesome.

159
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:42,748
我们怪异的出去
We should go out and just get freakin' weird.

160
00:05:42,748 --> 00:05:44,762
因为, 你知道, 你是坏人
Cause,you know,you be a bad,bad man,

161
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:46,776
我是罪犯
and I be an outlaw.

162
00:05:46,776 --> 00:05:48,502
怎样?
What?

163
00:05:49,365 --> 00:05:50,708
嘿, Thelma, Louise
Hey,Thelma,Louise,

164
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,297
你们别太越过界了, 听到没?
y'all don't drive off no cliffs now,ya hear?

165
00:05:53,297 --> 00:05:55,120
糟糕!
Lame!

166
00:05:55,887 --> 00:05:56,846
但说正经的
But seriously,

167
00:05:56,846 --> 00:05:57,421
给我留言
leave me a message,

168
00:05:57,421 --> 00:05:59,052
我稍后去找你们
and we'll meet up later.

169
00:06:02,025 --> 00:06:03,847
好了, 你觉得怎么样?
All right,what do you think?

170
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:05,765
恐怖
Horrible.

171
00:06:06,148 --> 00:06:08,834
真是个不错的父亲
You're gonna make such a great dad.

172
00:06:08,834 --> 00:06:10,464
你们看起来很古典
You look so classy and nice.

173
00:06:10,464 --> 00:06:12,190
你们这样去肯定立马被认出来
You're going to stick out like a sore thumb.

174
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,204
你们有见过现在孩子们怎么打扮吗
Have you seen how the kids are dressing
 these days,

175
00:06:14,204 --> 00:06:16,698
看看阿什莉・辛普森, 林赛罗韩和帕里斯・希尔顿?（都是It Girl）
with the Ashlee and the Lindsay and the Paris?

176
00:06:16,698 --> 00:06:18,041
都穿的像脱衣舞女郎
They all dress like strippers.

177
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,726
现在是变浪荡还是被赶回家
It's go whore or go home.

178
00:06:21,205 --> 00:06:22,356
恩, 我们必需得进去
Well,we have to get in.

179
00:06:22,356 --> 00:06:23,507
我得去看那个乐队
I have to see this band,

180
00:06:23,507 --> 00:06:25,233
因为我们周一前得做决定
cause we have to make a decision by Monday,

181
00:06:25,233 --> 00:06:27,151
因为我71天内就要结婚了
cause I'm getting married in 71 days,

182
00:06:27,151 --> 00:06:28,111
但我们还没有...
and we still don't have...

183
00:06:28,111 --> 00:06:31,275
甜心, 一次只顾一件事, 好吗?
Sweetie,just focus on one thing at a time,okay?

184
00:06:31,275 --> 00:06:34,344
现在, 你只要打扮的像妓女就行了
Right now,you just have to dress like
a whore and that's it.

185
00:06:34,344 --> 00:06:35,303
好的
All right.

186
00:06:35,303 --> 00:06:36,358
这就是精髓
That's the spirit.

187
00:06:36,358 --> 00:06:38,948
现在, 女士们, 放浪起来!
Now,ladies,slut up!

188
00:06:41,921 --> 00:06:44,318
我从没想过这会坏事
I never thought this would be a bad thing,

189
00:06:44,318 --> 00:06:46,812
但我的衣橱就是不够放浪
but my wardrobe just isn't slutty enough.

190
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:50,456
我都不知道我还有这件衣服
I didn't know I still had this.

191
00:06:50,456 --> 00:06:51,607
什么?
What?

192
00:06:51,991 --> 00:06:54,676
我在毕业舞会上穿的礼服
The dress I wore to my actual prom.

193
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:02,636
天那, 你是这舞会上最美的女孩
Dude,you are the hottest girl at this prom,

194
00:07:02,636 --> 00:07:04,650
不是一般的美
and not like in a corporate,plastic way.

195
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,143
是真的真的很美
Like,truly,truly hot.

196
00:07:07,143 --> 00:07:08,486
像美丽的灵魂
Like a hot soul.

197
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,939
啊, 你看起来也不错, Scooter
Aw,you look great,too,Scooter.

198
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:13,185
有个好消息
So big news.

199
00:07:13,185 --> 00:07:14,624
裁判学校来的消息
I heard from umpire school.

200
00:07:14,624 --> 00:07:15,775
我被录取了!
I'm in!

201
00:07:16,734 --> 00:07:18,652
噢, disco!
Oh,disco!

202
00:07:18,652 --> 00:07:21,050
我真为你开心
I am so happy for you.

203
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,214
你是想说为我们两开心, 是不, 宝贝?
You mean happy for us,right,babe?

204
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:28,051
Scooter, 你会成为裁判的
Scooter,you're gonna be an umpire someday.

205
00:07:28,051 --> 00:07:29,201
不, 宝贝
No,baby.

206
00:07:29,489 --> 00:07:32,078
我们将成为裁判的
We're gonna be an umpire someday.

207
00:07:33,997 --> 00:07:34,956
不错
Nice.

208
00:07:34,956 --> 00:07:36,011
你们看起来很不错
You ladies look good,

209
00:07:36,011 --> 00:07:38,025
但你们的行头还差样东西
but your outfits are missing just one thing.

210
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:39,079
别, Barney
No,Barney,

211
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,134
这是我们的极限了
this is as far as we're going to go.

212
00:07:40,134 --> 00:07:41,093
我不会再露...
I'm not showing anymore...

213
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:45,409
两朵美丽的花配上两个如花似玉的人
two beautiful flowers for two beautiful flowers.

214
00:07:45,793 --> 00:07:47,327
真好
Sweet.

215
00:07:47,327 --> 00:07:48,958
谢谢
Thank you.

216
00:07:49,917 --> 00:07:52,218
噢, Robin, 你哭了吗?
oh,Robin,are you tearing up?

217
00:07:52,218 --> 00:07:53,177
没有
No.

218
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:56,726
我从来没参加过毕业舞会, 好不?
I've never been to prom before,okay?

219
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,068
我们得走了 回头见
We got to go.See ya.

220
00:07:58,068 --> 00:07:59,219
拜, 玩的开心
Bye,have fun.

221
00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:00,274
回头见
See you.

222
00:08:02,384 --> 00:08:05,165
她们长大的真快, Ted?
They grow up into skanks so fast,
don't they,Ted?

223
00:08:05,165 --> 00:08:07,083
那好, 准备好了吗?
So,what,we ready for tonight?

224
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,426
有件事我们得先做
Just one thing we got to do first.

225
00:08:08,426 --> 00:08:09,769
来点吉姆・宾波本威酒?
Shot of Jim Beam?

226
00:08:09,769 --> 00:08:10,632
耶!
Yes!

227
00:08:10,632 --> 00:08:14,276
还有我答应Lily要装好200份邀请函
And then I promised Lily that we'd stuff
200 wedding invitations.

228
00:08:14,276 --> 00:08:14,852
什么?!
What?!

229
00:08:14,852 --> 00:08:15,715
抱歉, 伙计
I'm sorry,dude,

230
00:08:15,715 --> 00:08:17,345
但你也看到她压力有多大拉
but you saw how stressed out she is.

231
00:08:17,345 --> 00:08:19,167
拜托! 你一直不停的忙婚礼的事情
Come on! You've been doing wedding stuff nonstop.

232
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:20,222
休息下
Take a break.

233
00:08:20,222 --> 00:08:21,277
一旦结婚
Once you're married,

234
00:08:21,277 --> 00:08:23,099
如果你出门喝醉酒呕吐
if we go out and you get so drunk you throw up,

235
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:24,058
会很惨
it'll be sad,

236
00:08:24,058 --> 00:08:25,689
但如果今晚这样...
but if we do it tonight...

237
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:27,223
会比结婚后好点
it'll be less sad.

238
00:08:27,223 --> 00:08:28,086
好吧, 这样会很酷
Okay,it'll be cool

239
00:08:28,086 --> 00:08:28,758
我来告诉你
I'll tell you what.

240
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:29,909
我们来玩个游戏
We'll make a game out of it.

241
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:33,457
首先把邀请函装好得到个大奖励
First one to stuff a hundred invitations
gets a big prize.

242
00:08:33,457 --> 00:08:35,183
我看起来象才4岁吗?
Do I look like I'm four?

243
00:08:35,663 --> 00:08:37,293
好吧, 你说的是什么奖励?
All right,what kind of prize are we talking?

244
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:42,376
比我们高中时候保安更多
a lot more security than when we were kids.

245
00:08:42,376 --> 00:08:43,911
这样行吗?
Is this gonna work?

246
00:08:43,911 --> 00:08:45,253
听着, 我17岁时
Look,when I was 17,

247
00:08:45,253 --> 00:08:47,459
我经常溜进酒吧
I used to sneak into clubs all the time.

248
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,569
关键是要有自信
It's all about confidence.

249
00:08:49,569 --> 00:08:50,720
跟着我
Follow me.

250
00:08:51,871 --> 00:08:53,597
舞会快乐, 各位
Happy prom,everybody.

251
00:08:53,597 --> 00:08:55,131
去舞会咯
Going to prom

252
00:08:56,186 --> 00:08:56,858
你们是成人

253
00:08:56,858 --> 00:08:58,296
好吧, 拜
Okay,bye.

254
00:08:59,351 --> 00:09:00,214
好吧, 听着
Okay,look,

255
00:09:00,214 --> 00:09:01,845
我只是想看看乐队
I just need to see the band.

256
00:09:01,845 --> 00:09:03,859
我两个月内就要举行婚礼了, 但...
I'm getting married in two months,and...

257
00:09:03,859 --> 00:09:05,873
那你现在才找乐队?
And you're just finding a band?

258
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,325
抱歉, 夫人
I'm sorry,ma'am.

259
00:09:09,325 --> 00:09:12,490
必需得是学生或者学生的舞伴
You either need to be a student or the date of a student.

260
00:09:15,463 --> 00:09:16,326
"夫人?"
"Ma'am?"

261
00:09:16,326 --> 00:09:17,765
真失败
Check and mate.

262
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:18,436
很酷
It's cool.

263
00:09:18,436 --> 00:09:20,162
该执行计划B了
Time to activate plan B.

264
00:09:20,162 --> 00:09:23,039
Scherbotsky, 会用十字弩吗?
Scherbotsky,how comfortable are you with a crossbow?

265
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:24,286
Scherbotsky?
Scherbotsky?

266
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:26,300
嘿, 伙计们

267
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,081
你们想带两个辣妹去舞会不?
Do you want to take two hot girls to prom?

268
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:30,999
我们没钱

269
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:32,822
免费的
For free.

273
00:09:36,945 --> 00:09:37,521

283
00:10:02,405 --> 00:10:02,884
谢谢
Thank you.

284
00:10:02,884 --> 00:10:04,035
我们休息片刻
We're going to take a break.

285
00:10:04,035 --> 00:10:05,953
在开玩笑吧
you're kidding me.

286
00:10:06,337 --> 00:10:09,118
女士们想来点跨越年龄的东西吗?
you ladies want something to take the edge off?

287
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,954
管他呢? 这可是是毕业舞会
what the hell?It's prom.

288
00:10:16,982 --> 00:10:18,804
喝起来象止咳糖浆
that tastes like cough syrup.

289
00:10:18,804 --> 00:10:21,010
我们弄不到酒精
we couldn't get any alcohol.

290
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,641
我们的假身份证上写的是20岁
our fake ids say we're only 20.

291
00:10:22,641 --> 00:10:25,134
我们买回来才发现
We didn't realize it till after we bought them.

292
00:10:25,518 --> 00:10:27,819
不擅长数学的书呆子?
Nerds who aren't good at math?

293
00:10:27,819 --> 00:10:29,929
你们的未来很坎坷, 小伙子们
Life's going to be rough,boys.

294
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:33,286
嗨
Hi.

295
00:10:33,286 --> 00:10:34,341
打扰
Excuse me.

296
00:10:34,341 --> 00:10:37,889
不知道你们能不能演奏Violent Femmes的"good feeling"
I was wondering if you guys could play
"good feeling" by the Violent Femmes.

297
00:10:37,889 --> 00:10:39,424
我知道这可能不在你们的节目单上
I know it's probably not in your repertoire,

298
00:10:39,424 --> 00:10:43,164
但我快结婚了,我未婚夫想请你们在婚礼上演奏
but I'm getting married and my fiance
wants to hire you guys as the band,

299
00:10:43,164 --> 00:10:45,658
但我没听过你们演奏"good feeling"就不能接受你们
but I can't sign off on it until I hear you play "good feeling"

300
00:10:45,658 --> 00:10:46,617
因为这是我们的歌
because that's our song,

301
00:10:46,617 --> 00:10:47,767
如果你们不能演奏我们的歌
and what kind of wedding band would you be

302
00:10:47,767 --> 00:10:49,398
哪算婚礼乐队, 对吗?
if you couldn't play our song,right?

303
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,357
对吗?
Right?

304
00:10:50,453 --> 00:10:52,467
听着, 我现在有点迷糊
Look,I'm kinda wasted right now,

305
00:10:52,467 --> 00:10:54,193
听不懂你说什么
so I didn't understand any of that.

306
00:10:54,768 --> 00:10:56,303
但如果你找来活页乐谱
But,if you get us the sheet music,

307
00:10:56,303 --> 00:10:57,933
我们就演奏你的歌
we'll play your song.

308
00:10:58,509 --> 00:11:01,673
有反应吗, 宝贝?
So,you buzzing,baby?

309
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,783
我的痰没了
My phlegm feels looser.

310
00:11:16,155 --> 00:11:17,402
这太可悲了
This is pathetic.

311
00:11:17,402 --> 00:11:18,265
现在是单身之夜
It's guys' night.

312
00:11:18,265 --> 00:11:21,813
我们应该在酒吧里大打一场
We should be out in a bar getting in fights.

313
00:11:22,197 --> 00:11:24,115
如果我打架, 你会帮我吗?
If I got in a fight,would you have my back?

314
00:11:24,115 --> 00:11:25,745
当然
You know it.

315
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,527
我也会
I'd have your back,too.

316
00:11:29,486 --> 00:11:30,636
这不错
That's cool.

317
00:11:32,171 --> 00:11:34,281
什么, 你觉得不需要我帮助吗?
what,you don't think you'd need my help?

318
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,623
你不知道我多厉害
You don't know what I can do.

319
00:11:35,623 --> 00:11:37,062
我就像...
I'm like...

320
00:11:37,637 --> 00:11:38,884
像个狂暴战士
like a berserker.

321
00:11:38,884 --> 00:11:40,035
好了, Ted
Okay,Ted.

322
00:11:40,706 --> 00:11:41,378
喂
Hello.

323
00:11:41,378 --> 00:11:42,912
嘿, 我是Robin
Hey,it's Robin.

324
00:11:42,912 --> 00:11:45,502
Lily要你下载"good feeling"的活页乐谱
Lily needs you to download the sheet
music for "good feeling"

325
00:11:45,502 --> 00:11:48,283
然后马上带过来
and bring it out here,like,now.

326
00:11:48,283 --> 00:11:49,338
等等
Hang on.

327
00:11:49,338 --> 00:11:50,105
是Robin
It's Robin.

328
00:11:50,105 --> 00:11:51,735
她想让我去舞会
She wants me to go to prom.

329
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,558
Ted可以去吗?
Can Ted come?

330
00:11:53,558 --> 00:11:54,421
等等! 别问!
Wait! Don't ask!

331
00:11:54,421 --> 00:11:55,859
这太蹩脚了!
That's so lame!

332
00:11:55,859 --> 00:11:57,490
我根本不想去
I don't even want to go anyway.

333
00:11:58,832 --> 00:11:59,791
呃, 我不知道
Uh,I don't know.

334
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,422
现在我们两之间太怪异了
Things have been so weird between us.

335
00:12:01,422 --> 00:12:03,148
她说什么?
What'd she say?

336
00:12:03,627 --> 00:12:06,025
他撒谎说和女朋友分手
He lied and told me he broke up
with his girlfriend

337
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,039
来勾搭我
to try to hook up with me.

338
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:09,478
我是说, 我知道他道歉了
I mean,I know he apologized for it

339
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,875
但是很难原谅他
but it's just,it's not easy to forgive.

340
00:12:12,451 --> 00:12:14,561
听着, 如果你一定要带Ted来
Look,if you absolutely must bring Ted,

341
00:12:14,561 --> 00:12:17,821
我也不至于把自己眼珠挖出来
it's,it's not like I'm going to claw
my own eyes out if he comes.

342
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:19,356
好, 拜
Okay,bye.

343
00:12:20,602 --> 00:12:23,096
她完全愿意你过去
She totally wants you to come.

344
00:12:26,453 --> 00:12:29,138
好了, 活页乐谱在路上了
All right,sheet music's on the way.

345
00:12:30,672 --> 00:12:31,823
你还好吧?
Are you okay?

346
00:12:32,495 --> 00:12:34,413
婚礼还有好多事情要筹备
There's just so much to do for this wedding.

347
00:12:34,413 --> 00:12:36,331
我脑袋晕了
My head is swirling.

348
00:12:36,331 --> 00:12:39,304
这些来的太快了
It's just all moving too fast.

349
00:12:39,304 --> 00:12:40,934
怎么快了?
How is it moving too fast?

350
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:42,852
我们在一起两年拉
We've been together for two years.

351
00:12:42,852 --> 00:12:43,907
我只是...
I just...

352
00:12:43,907 --> 00:12:47,551
我只是不想人生每件事都被决定好
I just don't want everything in
my life to be decided already.

353
00:12:47,551 --> 00:12:48,990
什么决定好了?
What's decided?

354
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,045
我去裁判学校
I go to umpire school,

355
00:12:50,045 --> 00:12:51,004
你去念大学
you go to college.

356
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:53,210
我们搬进我爸爸斯塔腾岛上的房子
We move into my dad's house in Staten Island.

357
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,840
我们会有孩子, 我们一起变老
We have kids,we grow old together.

358
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,183
有什么决定好了?
What's decided?

359
00:12:56,183 --> 00:12:57,909
充满变数的!
It's wide open!

360
00:12:58,676 --> 00:12:59,827
Scooter
Scooter,

361
00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:02,225
我去大学的时候
when I go off to college,

362
00:13:02,225 --> 00:13:04,431
就是我们结束的时候
that's the end for us.

363
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,869
你要
You're,

364
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:07,883
你要和我分手吗?
you're breaking up with me?

365
00:13:07,883 --> 00:13:10,281
还有很多我想做的事情
There's still so much I want to do.

366
00:13:10,281 --> 00:13:12,007
我想去旅行
I want to travel,

367
00:13:12,007 --> 00:13:14,309
做个海外艺术青年
live overseas as an artist,

368
00:13:14,309 --> 00:13:17,090
也许来段同性恋情
maybe have a lesbian relationship.

369
00:13:17,665 --> 00:13:19,583
另外, 我和你约会
Plus,I think I was just dating you

370
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:22,173
是因为你长有点象Kurt Cobain
(吞枪自杀的Nirvana主唱)
cause you look a little bit like Kurt Cobain.

371
00:13:22,173 --> 00:13:23,611
我不敢相信这个
I can't believe this.

372
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:25,338
我可以改变
I can change.

373
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:26,968
我可以让自己更象Kurt Cobain
I can look more like Kurt Cobain.

374
00:13:26,968 --> 00:13:29,366
拜托, 别离开我
Please,just don't leave me.

375
00:13:29,366 --> 00:13:30,900
除了你我什么都没有了, 宝贝
I'm nothing without you,baby.

376
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,490
拜托别给我这么大压力!
Please don't put that kind of pressure on me!

377
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,120
这太多了!
It's too much!

378
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,613
只是一支舞, 天那!
It's just one dance,god!

379
00:13:37,613 --> 00:13:38,860
什么?
What?

380
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,066
我们答应他们跳支舞的
we did promise them one dance.

381
00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:42,984
当然可以
sure,okay.

382
00:13:50,848 --> 00:13:52,383
那么Andrew
so Andrew,

383
00:13:52,383 --> 00:13:53,725
你的人生大计是什么?
what's your big plan?

384
00:13:53,725 --> 00:13:56,219
今晚之后生活将怎样安排?
What's life going to be like after tonight?

385
00:13:56,219 --> 00:13:58,425
我把一切都安排好了
you know I got it all worked out.

386
00:13:58,425 --> 00:14:00,055
头也不回地离开这个地方
leave this place in my dust,

387
00:14:00,055 --> 00:14:01,493
大学四年的精彩生活
four awesome years at college,

388
00:14:01,493 --> 00:14:03,124
然后我会搬去布拉格
and then I'll move to prague

389
00:14:03,124 --> 00:14:05,713
或者开办我自己的游戏公司或其他什么
or start my own video game company or something.

390
00:14:05,713 --> 00:14:06,672
不, 你不会
No,you won't.

391
00:14:06,672 --> 00:14:07,535
我不会?
I won't?

392
00:14:07,535 --> 00:14:10,892
对, 你不会达成你设想的任何事
No,you won't accomplish anything you set out to.

393
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:13,194
你会在大学第一天交个女朋友
You'll get a girlfriend the first day of college

394
00:14:13,194 --> 00:14:14,728
然后你放弃独立
and you'll give up your independence

395
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:15,975
然后你永远不会住在国外
and you'll never live abroad

396
00:14:15,975 --> 00:14:18,181
你会在思考"我的希望和梦想呢?"
and you'll wind up old before your time wondering

397
00:14:18,181 --> 00:14:21,250
前慢慢变老
"whatever happened to my hopes and my dreams?"

398
00:14:22,113 --> 00:14:24,127
你真觉得我会找到个女朋友吗?
You really think i'll get a girlfriend?

399
00:14:25,853 --> 00:14:27,675
是为了什么?
So what's the deal here?

400
00:14:27,675 --> 00:14:29,018
我今晚走运了吗?
Am I getting lucky tonight?

401
00:14:30,456 --> 00:14:31,895
Sean, 听着
Sean,look,

402
00:14:33,142 --> 00:14:34,293
你是个好人
you're a nice guy,

403
00:14:34,293 --> 00:14:36,307
但是我只是...
but I just don't...

404
00:14:38,417 --> 00:14:40,526
不, 你今晚不会走运
no,you're not getting lucky tonight.

405
00:14:52,882 --> 00:14:53,554
好了, 酷一点
Okay,just be cool.

406
00:14:53,554 --> 00:14:54,896
别看着我
Don't look at me.

407
00:14:55,855 --> 00:14:57,198
好的
Okay.

408
00:14:57,198 --> 00:14:58,541
你们怎么进来的?
How'd you get in here?

409
00:14:58,541 --> 00:14:59,596
怎么了你
What's it to you,

410
00:14:59,596 --> 00:15:00,842
巨型海龟?
giant turtle?

411
00:15:01,706 --> 00:15:03,528
是我, Barney
It's me,Barney.

412
00:15:05,254 --> 00:15:05,829
Lily呢?
Where's Lily?

413
00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:07,364
她去洗手间了
She's in the bathroom.

414
00:15:07,843 --> 00:15:08,803
等在这, 我得去找下乐队
Wait here,I should go talk to the band.

415
00:15:08,803 --> 00:15:09,282
好
All right.

416
00:15:09,282 --> 00:15:10,529
你们两个家伙怎么进来的?
How did you guys get in here?

417
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:11,584
我们从后面进来的
We just snuck in the back.

418
00:15:11,584 --> 00:15:12,639
你们...
You just snu...

419
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,694
真的吗?
are you serious?

420
00:15:13,694 --> 00:15:15,803
我整晚都在试着溜进来
I've been trying to get in here all night.

421
00:15:15,803 --> 00:15:20,695
最后好不容易才给了看门人200块钱
让我借了这套吉祥物制服
I finally paid a janitor 200 bucks
to let me borrow this mascot costume.

422
00:15:20,695 --> 00:15:21,941
但你还是进来了
But you got in.

423
00:15:22,517 --> 00:15:24,818
又慢又稳的赢得了赛跑
slow and steady won the race.

424
00:15:27,696 --> 00:15:28,271
嘿, 兄弟
Hey,bro,

425
00:15:28,271 --> 00:15:29,805
你们有看见我的未婚妻Lily吗?
have you seen my fiancee Lily?

426
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:31,340
你未婚妻?
Your fiancee?

427
00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:33,833
今晚她是我的伴, 兄弟
tonight she's with me,bro.

428
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,943
除非你想找茬
Unless you're looking for trouble.

429
00:15:35,943 --> 00:15:36,615
听着, 小家伙
Listen,little buddy,

430
00:15:36,615 --> 00:15:37,670
我知道这是毕业舞会
I understand it's prom

431
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,916
肾上腺素增长, 但...
and the adrenaline's pumping,but...

432
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:39,875
不, 不是今晚
no,not tonight.

433
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:40,834
我等待这刻很久了
I've waited too long for this.

434
00:15:40,834 --> 00:15:41,889
我终于找到了个女孩
I finally got a girl

435
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:44,191
我不会让你把她从我旁边带走的
and I'm not going to let you take
her away from me.

436
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:47,260
听着, 不是带走
Look,let's not get carried away.

437
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,562
呀! 双节棍!
Yah! Nunchaku!

438
00:15:53,014 --> 00:15:55,987
我不敢相信我对个高中生那样
I can't believe I unloaded like that
on a high school senior.

439
00:15:55,987 --> 00:15:59,248
我不敢相信一个高中生对我那样
I can't believe a high school senior
unloaded like that on me.

440
00:16:01,358 --> 00:16:02,509
我要问你个问题
I'm going to ask you something

441
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:04,619
也许这很疯狂
and,maybe it's crazy

442
00:16:04,619 --> 00:16:06,633
因为你们永远是最可爱的一对
cause you guys are the cutest couple ever.

443
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:07,783
但, 呃
But,um

444
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,085
你犹豫了吗?
are you having second thoughts?

445
00:16:14,113 --> 00:16:15,935
嗯,但不是因为Marshall
But not about Marshall.

446
00:16:15,935 --> 00:16:17,470
是我自己
About me.

447
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:21,594
我不停的想着十年前的自己
I just keep thinking about the girl
I was ten years ago

448
00:16:21,594 --> 00:16:24,087
想着她经历了什么
and wondering what happened to her.

449
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,293
我不想被绑死在一个地方
I don't want to be tied down.

450
00:16:26,293 --> 00:16:29,362
我想游居于法国, 西班牙和意大利
I want to live in France and Spain and Italy

451
00:16:29,362 --> 00:16:31,088
汲取生活
and just soak up life

452
00:16:31,088 --> 00:16:32,814
然后画在画布上
and put it on a canvas,

453
00:16:32,814 --> 00:16:36,555
就算得在烂咖啡馆里端上五年盘子
even if it means being a waitress
in crappy cafee for five years,

454
00:16:36,555 --> 00:16:37,610
我也不在乎
I don't care.

455
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,952
我要当个画家
I'm going to be a painter.

456
00:16:38,952 --> 00:16:41,062
旁边有个男朋友牵着我脖子
And I can't do any of that with a,

457
00:16:41,062 --> 00:16:44,227
我就做不了这些了, 你懂吗?
with a boyfriend shackled
around my neck,you know?

458
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,775
但无论如何, 我话多
But anyway,I'm blabbering.

459
00:16:47,775 --> 00:16:49,789
交朋友的方式, Lily
Way to make new friends,Lily.

460
00:16:50,461 --> 00:16:51,324
抱歉
I'm sorry.

461
00:16:51,324 --> 00:16:53,146
能再说次你的名字吗?
What was your name again?

462
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:54,201
Marshall

很高兴认识你, Marshall
Nice to meet you,Marshall.

464
00:16:57,174 --> 00:16:58,804
我们住对门
Guess we're hallmates.

465
00:17:03,312 --> 00:17:04,942
装好了

我喜欢这首歌
I love this song.

00:17:08,011 --> 00:17:09,450
我也是
Me,too.

469
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:16,163
我的人生计划一件都没实现
I didn't have any of the experiences I set out to.

470
00:17:16,643 --> 00:17:17,889
旅行
The travel,

471

Lily
Lily,

475
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,535
你要和世界上你最好的朋友结婚了
you're marrying your best friend in the world.

476
00:17:28,535 --> 00:17:32,179
这难道不值得用所有这些经历换取吗?
I mean,isn't that worth all the other
experiences combined?

477
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,399
还有, 你还是可以旅行
And look,you can still travel,

478

还是可以绘画

至于你的同性恋经历...

480
00:17:44,071 --> 00:17:45,030
开心了不?

现在欲火中烧了吧?
So felt hotty?

482
00:17:48,483 --> 00:17:49,729
闭嘴
Shut up.

非法入侵, 袭击未成年人
Trespassing,assaulting a minor.

485
00:17:56,922 --> 00:17:59,799

We can have you guys arrested,you know that?

486
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:00,471
噢, 拜托
Oh,come on

487
00:18:00,471 --> 00:18:02,197
你让孩子带着双节棍进去
you're the one who let in a kid with nunchakus.

488
00:18:02,197 --> 00:18:03,252
你们称的上保全人员吗?
You call yourself security guards?

489
00:18:03,252 --> 00:18:04,978
我只是在保护我的男孩
I was just defending my boy here.

490
00:18:04,978 --> 00:18:06,225
我完全可以搞定那个小孩

491
00:18:06,225 --> 00:18:07,951
我也完全帮你了, 所以...

00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:30,393
你知道, 作为乌龟

他跑的惊人的快

508
00:18:50,341 --> 00:18:53,889
*It always seems like you're leaving
It always seems like you're leaving

509
00:18:53,889 --> 00:19:00,794
*when I need you here just a little longer

510
00:19:02,137 --> 00:19:04,343
你的第一个毕业舞会怎么样?
so how was your first prom?

511
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:05,494
你告诉我
You tell me.

512
00:19:05,494 --> 00:19:06,836
我讨厌我的礼服
I hated my dress,

513
00:19:06,836 --> 00:19:09,138
我的舞伴吐在我身上
my date got wasted and puked on me,

514
00:19:09,138 --> 00:19:12,399
发生了打斗事件还有我吻了个女孩
there was a huge fight and I kissed a girl.

515
00:19:12,399 --> 00:19:13,741
那么, 基本上
So,basically,

516
00:19:13,741 --> 00:19:15,180
确实是毕业舞会
it was a prom.

517
00:19:16,331 --> 00:19:17,961
好吧, 我有想你
Okay,I've missed you.

518
00:19:18,537 --> 00:19:21,222
不是因为理解
Not in a we're-going-to-make-out way,

519
00:19:21,222 --> 00:19:23,619
不是因为我原谅你
not even in an I-forgive-you way.

520
00:19:24,674 --> 00:19:26,688
只是我很想你
Just in a I've-missed-you way.

521
00:19:27,743 --> 00:19:29,374
我还奢望别的什么呢？
what I can get?

522
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:33,306
我的朋友们
And that,my friends,

523
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:37,238
所以说穿着牛仔装去看脱衣舞很吃亏
is why you don't get your money's worth when you wear jeans to a strip club.


524
00:19:40,307 --> 00:19:41,841
所以你得同意
So you got to admit,

525
00:19:41,841 --> 00:19:43,759
88乐队在摇滚我们的歌

526
00:19:44,335 --> 00:19:45,486
