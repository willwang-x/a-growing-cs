The Words of Love

00:00:03,446 --> 00:00:05,364
老爸老妈的罗漫史
第1季 第13集
How.I.Met.Your.Mother
Season 01 Episode 13

4
00:00:13,132 --> 00:00:16,009
孩子们, 生活中有很多浪漫的时刻
Kids,in life there are a lot of big romantic moments.

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,215
这让生活更精彩
And they make life worth living

6
00:00:18,215 --> 00:00:19,653
但问题是
but here's the problem:

7
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:21,284
浪漫过后
Moments pass,

8
00:00:21,284 --> 00:00:23,873
潜伏在角落里的是个满面胡子残酷的
and lurking just around the corner from those moments

9
00:00:23,873 --> 00:00:26,750
名叫现实的家伙
is a cruel,unshaven bastard named reality.

10
00:00:27,805 --> 00:00:30,203
那么, 回溯到2006年
And so,back in 2006,

11
00:00:30,203 --> 00:00:32,792
Claudia和Stuart婚礼的那个晚上
on the night of Claudia and Stuart's wedding,

12
00:00:32,792 --> 00:00:34,518
现实就是敌人
reality was the enemy.

13
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:36,820
（美国的）和平队?
The Peace Corps?

14
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,601
我明天出航 时间两年
I ship out tomorrow two years.

15
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:43,150
你知道, 有些人说参加和平队是一个人能做的最高尚的事
You know,some people say the Peace Corps is
the most noble thing a person can do.

16
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:46,219
对这些人, 我会问 "是吗?"
To those people,I say,"is it?"

17
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:49,096
一般他们会答 "对, 是的"
And usually they say,"yes,it is."

18
00:00:49,671 --> 00:00:51,493
Barney, 他们是对的
Barney,they are so right.

19
00:00:51,493 --> 00:00:53,699
我希望我也能做点什么
I wish there was something I could do.

20
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:55,042
噢 Tanya...
Oh Tanya...

21
00:00:55,042 --> 00:00:57,919
我很高兴你能这么说
I'm so glad you said that.

22
00:00:57,919 --> 00:01:00,796
这不是我预期的的一晚
This wasn't how I'd thought the night would
turn out.

23
00:01:01,276 --> 00:01:04,153
今晚应该是我和Robin共渡的浪漫时刻
This was finally supposed to be my big moment with Robin.

24
00:01:04,632 --> 00:01:06,934
但是现实随后而来
But then reality came along.

25
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:09,811
Robin在最后一分钟被叫去代播11点新闻
Robin got called up last minute to anchor
the 11:00 news.

26
00:01:10,482 --> 00:01:12,113
那是她事业的大突破
It was her big break.

27
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:14,702
我只好一个人去婚礼
And I went to the wedding stag.

28
00:01:14,702 --> 00:01:17,100
然后, 当我期待着至少...
Then, when I least expected it...

29
00:01:27,457 --> 00:01:30,239
你昨晚干嘛去了?
where the hell did you disappear to last night?

30
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,116
我渡过了最难忘的一晚
I had the most amazing night ever.

31
00:01:33,308 --> 00:01:33,979
说来听听
Tell me about it.

32
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:34,842
那蛋糕
That cake.

33
00:01:34,842 --> 00:01:36,089
是我吃过的最棒的蛋糕
Best cake I ever had.

34
00:01:36,089 --> 00:01:36,760
说真的
Seriously.

35
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,582
我的胃象在说 "嘿, 伙计"
My stomach was,like,"hey,bro,"

36
00:01:38,582 --> 00:01:39,445
不知道你在吃什么
I don't know what you're eating,

37
00:01:39,445 --> 00:01:40,405
因为我没长眼睛
cause I don't have any eyes,

38
00:01:40,405 --> 00:01:41,459
但是这真的很棒
but it's basically awesome,

39
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:43,569
多送点来食管"
so keep sending it down gullet alley."

40
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:44,337
我知道
I know.

41
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:45,296
我的胃像在说
My stomach was,like,

42
00:01:45,296 --> 00:01:48,173
"女朋友, 我们不是一直相处的和睦
但那蛋糕..."
"girlfriend,we don't always get along,
but that cake..."

43
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,515
Lily
Lily.

44
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,433
对了
right.

45
00:01:51,433 --> 00:01:54,215
"有史来最美妙的一晚" 说吧
"Most amazing night ever," and go.

46
00:01:54,215 --> 00:01:56,900
你知道, 我得告诉你, 我有个原则
You know,I should tell you,I have a rule.

47
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,010
我向来不在婚礼上找伴
I never hook up at weddings.

48
00:01:59,394 --> 00:02:01,695
我猜你不是一直都坚守原则
I'm guessing you haven't always had this rule.

49
00:02:01,695 --> 00:02:04,572
因为, 这些浪漫时刻
here's the thing,those big romantic moments,

50
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,394
经历的时候很棒
they're great when they happen,

51
00:02:06,394 --> 00:02:07,641
但它们并不现实
but they're not real.

52
00:02:07,641 --> 00:02:10,231
是啊, 是啊，就像,就像，现在
Exactly,exactly，like，like just now,

53
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:11,573
当我看见你在那边跳小鸡舞时
when I saw you doing the chicken dance out there,

54
00:02:11,573 --> 00:02:13,012
我不会说谎骗你
I'm not gonna lie to you,

55
00:02:13,012 --> 00:02:14,546
当时我象被电闪了
big time thunderbolt.

56
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,464
你应该看我跳踢踏舞
You should see me tap dance.

57
00:02:16,464 --> 00:02:18,191
你会跪地哀求
You'd be down on bended knee.

58
00:02:18,191 --> 00:02:20,396
还好没有疯狂
Sadly not out of character.

59
00:02:20,396 --> 00:02:22,602
但我知道这只是幻觉
But I know now it's just a mirage.

60
00:02:22,602 --> 00:02:24,233
婚礼幻视
Wedding goggles.

61
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:25,000
正确
Exactly.

62
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,055
所以, 简单的说
And that,in a nutshell,

63
00:02:26,055 --> 00:02:27,973
这就是为什么我不会对你采取进一步行动
is why I'm not putting the moves on you.

64
00:02:27,973 --> 00:02:29,124
现在这不是你的行动吗?
This isn't the moves?

65
00:02:29,124 --> 00:02:29,987
什么, 你...
What,you...

66
00:02:29,987 --> 00:02:30,754
你觉得这是吗?
you think this is the moves?

67
00:02:30,754 --> 00:02:32,576
相信我, 你知道什么是真正的行动
Believe me,you'd know the moves.

68
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:35,453
那么10桌外的人们也知道了
People ten tables away would know the moves.

69
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:36,988
这太糟了
that's too bad.

70
00:02:36,988 --> 00:02:38,235
说来听听
Tell me about it.

71
00:02:38,618 --> 00:02:40,345
你知道, 我认为...
You know,I think...

72
00:02:40,345 --> 00:02:41,783
我有解决办法
I have a solution.

73
00:02:41,783 --> 00:02:42,742
有意思
Interested.

74
00:02:42,742 --> 00:02:44,948
首先
And to preface this,

75
00:02:44,948 --> 00:02:46,770
我们今晚不会上床
we're not gonna sleep together tonight.

76
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,688
没那么有趣了
Less interested.

77
00:02:48,688 --> 00:02:49,551
继续
go ahead.

78
00:02:49,551 --> 00:02:50,510
好的
Okay.

79
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,387
所以一般搞砸的会是第二次见面
So the thing that always screws it up is 
the next day.

80
00:02:53,963 --> 00:02:55,018
是吗?
Right?

81
00:02:55,018 --> 00:02:55,977
那么...
So...

82
00:02:55,977 --> 00:02:58,566
为什么我们不直接把那部分去掉呢?
why don't we just cut that part out?

83
00:02:58,566 --> 00:02:59,525
你的意思是?
What are you saying?

84
00:02:59,525 --> 00:03:02,307
我是说, 我在这儿, 你也在这儿
I'm saying,I'm here,you're here,

85
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,512
这是个盛大的婚礼
this is a big romantic wedding

86
00:03:04,512 --> 00:03:07,389
为什么我们不跳跳舞共渡美妙时光
why don't we just dance and have a great time,

87
00:03:08,253 --> 00:03:11,130
然后结束后
不要再见面
and then when it's over,
never see each other again.

88
00:03:13,048 --> 00:03:13,623
除非...
Unless...

89
00:03:13,623 --> 00:03:15,637
不 没有除非
no. No unless.

90
00:03:15,637 --> 00:03:18,514
不留e-mail, 不留电话甚至不留姓名
No e-mails,no phone numbers,not even names.

91
00:03:19,665 --> 00:03:22,542
今晚我们将有一个永不磨灭的回忆
Tonight we will make a memory that will never be tarnished.

92
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,091
然后...
And then...

93
00:03:26,091 --> 00:03:28,105
当我们老去时
when we're old and gray,

94
00:03:28,105 --> 00:03:29,927
回想今晚
we'll look back on this night

95
00:03:29,927 --> 00:03:31,749
将是完美的一晚
and it'll be perfect.

96
00:03:36,352 --> 00:03:37,311
好吧, 我参加
Okay,I'm in.

97
00:03:37,311 --> 00:03:37,791
好的
Okay.

98
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,997
我想, 我们得有假名?
I guess,what,we'll need fake names?

99
00:03:41,148 --> 00:03:43,258
你可以叫我奶油花
you can call me Buttercup.

100
00:03:43,737 --> 00:03:45,272
很高兴认识你, 奶油花
Pleased to meet you,Buttercup.

101
00:03:45,272 --> 00:03:47,669
我叫... Lando Calrissian
（星战里面的赌徒无赖）
I'm... Lando Calrissian.

102
00:03:49,108 --> 00:03:50,067
这有点让人激动
this is kind of exciting.

103
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:51,505
我们的名字会永远...
Our names will forever be shrouded...

104
00:03:51,505 --> 00:03:52,560
Ted,Ted,Ted
Ted,Ted,Ted.

105
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,327
看, 我钓到了个伴娘
Look,I got a bridesmaid.

106
00:03:53,327 --> 00:03:55,437
Ted, 看, 看, Ted, 第二辣的伴娘
Ted,look,look,Ted,the second hottest bridesmaid.

107
00:03:55,437 --> 00:03:56,205
Ted,看
Ted,look.

108
00:03:56,205 --> 00:03:57,260
再见咯,Ted
See ya,Ted.

109
00:04:00,712 --> 00:04:02,247
恩,我是Ted.
So,I'm Ted.

110
00:04:02,247 --> 00:04:03,589
Victoria
Victoria.

111
00:04:04,165 --> 00:04:04,932
不要说姓
But no last names.

112
00:04:04,932 --> 00:04:06,466
不说姓
No last names.

113
00:04:08,768 --> 00:04:10,494
你有问题啊?
what is wrong with you?

114
00:04:10,494 --> 00:04:12,796
伙计, 那就象...
Dude,that is just,like...

115
00:04:12,796 --> 00:04:14,810
个烂点子
a weenie-ass idea.

116
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,057
不, 那很棒
No,it was awesome

117
00:04:16,057 --> 00:04:16,824
我有个很棒的夜晚
I had a great night,

118
00:04:16,824 --> 00:04:17,879
我再也不会见到她
I'm never gonna see her again,

119
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:19,701
没人能破坏那一晚
and there's no way to ruin it.

120
00:04:19,701 --> 00:04:21,236
Ted, 我该怎么跟你说?
Ted,how do I explain this to you?

121
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,880
昨晚我吃了这辈子吃过最好吃的蛋糕
Last night I ate the best cake of my life.

122
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,414
现在, 你想让我再也吃不到了吗?
Now,you think I'm gonna let that cake
out of my life?

123
00:04:26,414 --> 00:04:28,332
天, 不要 我要找到是谁做的那蛋糕
Hell,no.I'm gonna find out what bakery
made that cake,

124
00:04:28,332 --> 00:04:30,250
然后我要弄多点蛋糕来
and then I'm gonna get some more cake.

125
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,840
那蛋糕真的很吸引你?
That cake really got to you?

126
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,087
它勾引我
It haunts me.

127
00:04:35,429 --> 00:04:37,347
恩, 后来怎么了?
So,what happened next?

128
00:04:37,347 --> 00:04:38,402
好了
Okay.

129
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:40,704
基本规则已经建立了
Ground rules have been established.

130
00:04:40,704 --> 00:04:43,581
现在让我看看你说了那么多的行动怎么进行
Now let's see some of these moves I've heard
so much about.

131
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,829
等等,等等
Wait,wait,wait,wait,wait.

132
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,377
我们来做所有单身女性都想在婚礼上干的偷走花球
Let's do all the single ladies in this joint a big favor and steal the bouquet.

133
00:04:56,624 --> 00:04:58,638
好, 但我们得...
Yes,but we'll need...

134
00:04:58,638 --> 00:04:59,981
分散大家注意力
a diversion.

135
00:05:00,364 --> 00:05:01,611
接吻!
kiss!

136
00:05:01,611 --> 00:05:03,913
吻! 吻, 来一个!
Kiss! Kiss,come on!

137
00:05:03,913 --> 00:05:05,543
接吻! 接吻! 接吻!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

138
00:05:05,543 --> 00:05:06,886
走, 走, 快走
Go,go,go,go,go,go,go.

139
00:05:06,886 --> 00:05:09,763
那就是花球的下落
So that's what happened to the bouquet.

140
00:05:09,955 --> 00:05:11,585
你知道, Victoria干的好
You know,good for Victoria.

141
00:05:11,585 --> 00:05:14,079
真是邪恶的传统
It's such an evil tradition.

142
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,997
你不会在你的婚礼上抛花球?
You're not gonna do it at your wedding?

143
00:05:15,997 --> 00:05:17,819
天, 我要拿起那束花弹
Hell,I'm gonna take that flower-grenade

144
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:19,257
甩到人群里然后大叫
and chuck it into the crowd and scream,

145
00:05:19,257 --> 00:05:21,271
"爬过来抢吧, 婊子们!"
"crawl for it,bitches!"

146
00:05:22,135 --> 00:05:23,957
那就是女孩们想做的
That's just what girls do.

147
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,163
那么, 你们两去哪了?
So,where'd you guys go?

148
00:05:36,808 --> 00:05:37,959
很不错
是吗?
very nice.
Yeah?

149
00:05:40,932 --> 00:05:42,083
好吧, 我其实不知道怎么跳踢踏舞
Okay,I don't really know how to tap dance.

150
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,138
我也分不出来
I couldn't tell.

151
00:05:43,138 --> 00:05:44,672
真的
Really.

152
00:05:46,974 --> 00:05:49,371
今晚我们不能怎么样太遗憾了
it's too bad you're not gonna get some tonight.

153
00:05:50,234 --> 00:05:51,769
如果我想, 我就能
if I wanted some,I could get some.

154
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:53,399
不, 你不能
No,you couldn't.

155
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,838
你是个男人
You're a dude.

156
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:57,044
- 我能干什么
- 你完全能干点什么
- I could get some.
- You could totally get some.

157
00:06:02,318 --> 00:06:03,853
我们今晚不能接吻
We're not gonna kiss tonight.

158
00:06:06,442 --> 00:06:08,073
如果 如果我们接吻了
if if we kiss,

159
00:06:08,073 --> 00:06:09,799
所有这些都会变的现实
all of this becomes real.

160
00:06:09,799 --> 00:06:12,676
你 你可能舌头伸太长
You you might use too much tongue.

161
00:06:12,676 --> 00:06:13,443
我可能伸的不够长
I might not use enough.

162
00:06:13,443 --> 00:06:15,649
然后突然,这些被破坏
And then suddenly,poof,spell's broken.

163
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:18,238
我舌头在你嘴里会用的恰倒好处的
I will use exactly the right amount of tongue.

164
00:06:20,061 --> 00:06:21,116
好吧, 这样怎么样?
Okay,how about this?

165
00:06:23,609 --> 00:06:26,486
任何初吻的最棒部分都是引发的过程
The best part of any first kiss is the
lead-up to it.

166
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:30,898
嘴唇接触到的前一刻
The moment right before the lips touch.

167
00:06:30,994 --> 00:06:33,871
就象前奏锣鼓
It's like a big drumroll.

168
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,501
所以...
So...

169
00:06:36,172 --> 00:06:37,419
今晚
how about tonight,

170
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:40,200
我们只进行到前奏怎么样?
we just stick with the drumroll?

171
00:06:41,831 --> 00:06:42,694
好吧
Okay.

172
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,132
但我们不能接吻
But we can't kiss.

173
00:06:44,996 --> 00:06:46,434
好吧
Okay.

174
00:07:05,615 --> 00:07:07,245
前奏锣鼓?
A drumroll?

175
00:07:07,245 --> 00:07:08,492
对
That's it

176
00:07:08,492 --> 00:07:09,739
所以, 那, 你就...
so,what,you just...

177
00:07:09,739 --> 00:07:12,328
你就说晚安, 回家...
you said good night,came home and...

178
00:07:12,328 --> 00:07:14,246
独自敲鼓?
performed a drum solo?

179
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:17,603
Ted, 你这个蠢家伙!
Ted,you're such a doof!

180
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,329
我是说, 这女孩听起来那么棒
I mean,this girl sounds amazing.

181
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:21,056
她确实很棒
She was completely amazing.

182
00:07:21,056 --> 00:07:23,165
她还很幽默
She was amazing and funny,

183
00:07:23,165 --> 00:07:25,179
我们很合拍
and we connected on every level,

184
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:27,002
而且我们再也不会见面了
and I'm never gonna see her again.

185
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:30,646
该死, 我得再见到她!
Damn it,I have to see her again!

186
00:07:30,646 --> 00:07:32,660
对! 对!
Yes! Yes!

187
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,619
行动起来吧, 兄弟
So let's get to work,man.

188
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,770
关于她你还知道什么?
What else do you know about her?

189
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:35,921
什么也没了 她叫Victoria
Nothing.Her name's Victoria

190
00:07:35,921 --> 00:07:37,359
这就是全部我知道的
that's all I got.

191
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:39,181
等下, Claudia, Claudia知道
Wait,Claudia,Claudia would know.

192
00:07:39,181 --> 00:07:40,524
Claudia正在渡蜜月
Claudia's on her honeymoon.

193
00:07:40,524 --> 00:07:42,442
她两周后会回来 那时候打给她
She'll be back in two weeks,call her then.

194
00:07:42,442 --> 00:07:43,305
好, 两周
Yes,two weeks.

195
00:07:43,305 --> 00:07:44,360
好主意
Good idea.

196
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,607
我现在就打给她
I'm calling her now.

197
00:07:45,607 --> 00:07:48,484
别, Ted, 你不会去搞砸蜜月的
No,Ted,you don't mess with a honeymoon.

198
00:07:48,484 --> 00:07:49,443
来吧, 伙计
come on,dude.

199
00:07:49,443 --> 00:07:50,882
问下她蛋糕
Ask her about the cake.

200
00:07:53,663 --> 00:07:54,910
Ted?
Ted?

201
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:55,965
嘿，Claudia!
Hey,Claudia!

202
00:07:55,965 --> 00:07:58,458
盛大的婚礼, 美妙的祝酒词, 美味的食物
Great wedding,beautiful toast,touching stuff.

203
00:07:58,458 --> 00:07:59,417
蜜月怎么样?
How's the honeymoon?

204
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:01,143
听着, 我打电话是因为昨晚我遇到一个女孩
Listen,I'm calling because last night
I met this girl,

205
00:08:01,143 --> 00:08:03,541
我在想你是否知道...
and I was wondering if you had...

206
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:06,322
你在开我玩笑吧!
you have got to be freaking kidding me!

207
00:08:06,322 --> 00:08:07,473
又来了
here we go.

208
00:08:07,473 --> 00:08:09,295
24小时前, 你还求我...
24 hours ago,you were begging...

209
00:08:09,295 --> 00:08:12,076
求我带另个女孩参加我婚礼
begging me to bring some other girl to my wedding,

210
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:12,940
现在
and now,

211
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,186
你就和她分了?
you're over her?

212
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,817
我向前走了?
I've moved on?

213
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,447
她叫什么?
What was her name?

214
00:08:17,447 --> 00:08:18,406
是我的胖堂妹Lindsay吗?
Is it my fat cousin Lindsay?

215
00:08:18,406 --> 00:08:20,516
别觉得尴尬 她眼睛很美
Don't be embarrassed,she has pretty eyes.

216
00:08:20,516 --> 00:08:21,091
不是
no.

217
00:08:21,091 --> 00:08:22,050
她叫Victoria
Her name was Victoria.

218
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,777
我不知道她姓什么
I don't know her last name.

219
00:08:24,256 --> 00:08:25,215
幸运的是
lucky for you,

220
00:08:25,215 --> 00:08:27,709
我知道嘉宾名单上的每一个人
I know that guest list backwards and forwards.

221
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:29,051
谢天谢地
Thank god.

222
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:30,298
不幸的是
Unlucky for you,

223
00:08:30,298 --> 00:08:31,641
我婚礼上没有叫Victoria的人
there was no Victoria at my wedding.

224
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:32,888
再见, Ted
Goodbye,Ted.

225
00:08:38,546 --> 00:08:40,944
婚礼上没有叫Victoria的
There was no Victoria at the wedding.

226
00:08:40,944 --> 00:08:43,821
可能她用了第二个假名
Maybe she used a second fake name.

227
00:08:43,821 --> 00:08:44,684
她真行
she's good,

228
00:08:44,684 --> 00:08:45,931
她真是行啊
she's very good.

229
00:08:45,931 --> 00:08:47,657
也许她是个幽灵
Maybe she was ghost.

230
00:08:47,657 --> 00:08:49,575
这就是为什么她不吻你
That's why she didn't want to kiss you

231
00:08:49,575 --> 00:08:52,164
因为你会穿过她的身体感觉到一丝凉意
because you'd just pass right through her 
and feel really cold for a second.

232
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,370
我的天, 我刚想出了个绝妙的剧本
my god,I just had a great idea for a screenplay.

233
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,425
Marshall...
Marshall...

234
00:08:55,425 --> 00:08:56,960
她不是幽灵!
she was not a ghost!

235
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,590
我知道她不是幽灵
I know that she wasn't a ghost.

236
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:01,275
她把花球拿起来了,说明她有肉体
She picked up a bouquet,proving she had corporeal form.

237
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:02,906
等等!
Wait,wait!

238
00:09:02,906 --> 00:09:04,440
她坐在伴娘的对面
She was sitting across from a couple
of bridesmaids.

239
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,303
她一定在那桌
She must've been at their table.

240
00:09:05,303 --> 00:09:06,454
也许她们知道她是谁
Maybe they know who she was.

241
00:09:06,454 --> 00:09:06,934
太好了
Great.

242
00:09:06,934 --> 00:09:09,523
所以我们怎么找到伴娘呢?
So how do we get in touch with the bridesmaids?

243
00:09:12,757 --> 00:09:13,716
这太棒了
this better be good

244
00:09:13,716 --> 00:09:15,634
我快飞上天堂了
I am about to enter Nirvana.

245
00:09:15,634 --> 00:09:16,976
顺便说下, 我应该给你涅磐的电话
By the way,I should get you Nirvana's
phone number.

246
00:09:16,976 --> 00:09:18,223
她按摩太棒了
She gives a great massage.

247
00:09:18,223 --> 00:09:18,990
说什么?!
Say what?!

248
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,333
Barney!
Barney!

249
00:09:21,196 --> 00:09:22,827
我知道这的规矩
I know the house rules.

250
00:09:22,827 --> 00:09:24,553
Es un chiste!
Es un chiste!

251
00:09:24,936 --> 00:09:25,704
听着, Barney
Listen,Barney,

252
00:09:25,704 --> 00:09:27,430
我看见你昨晚和个伴娘一起
I saw you talking to that bridesmaid last night.

253
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,060
你有没拿到她电话?
Did you happen to get her phone number?

254
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,595
你知道我有
You know I did.

255
00:09:30,595 --> 00:09:31,362
太棒了!
Great!

256
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,992
我要你为我给她打电话
I'm gonna need you to call her for me.

257
00:09:32,992 --> 00:09:35,198
不知道我不会
You know I won't.

258
00:09:35,198 --> 00:09:36,349
为什么?
Why not?

259
00:09:36,349 --> 00:09:38,363
因为我们只是昨晚一起
Because we just hooked up last night.

260
00:09:38,363 --> 00:09:40,089
我不会第二天就给她打电话
I can't call the girl the next day.

261
00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:42,103
我得等到至少, 大概...
I have to wait at least,like...

262
00:09:42,103 --> 00:09:43,158
永远
forever.

263
00:09:43,158 --> 00:09:45,172
噢 咔嚓! 永远也不打给她
Oh,snap! Never gonna call her.

264
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,857
而且, 她以为我在去印度的路上
Besides,she thinks I'm on my way to India.

265
00:09:47,857 --> 00:09:50,735
拜托, Barney, 这次理由很充分
come on,Barney,it's for a good cause,

266
00:09:51,214 --> 00:09:55,591
Ted搞砸了那么多次和女孩一起,这绝对不是个好理由
Ted going all castrati over yet another girl
is exactly not a good cause.

267
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:58,215
抱歉, 兄弟,我希望我能帮你但我的手被绑住了
Sorry,buddy,I wish I could help you, my hands are tied.

268
00:09:58,215 --> 00:09:58,982
等等
wait

269
00:09:58,982 --> 00:10:00,229
那是昨晚
that was last night.

270
00:10:02,243 --> 00:10:04,065
好吧, Barney, 我来告诉你我会做什么
okay,Barney,I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

271
00:10:04,545 --> 00:10:09,422
你打这个电话我就和你一起去看女子拳击
You make this call and I will go with you
to Foxy Boxing.

272
00:10:10,203 --> 00:10:11,162
- 真的吗?
- 是的。
- Really?
- Yeah.

273
00:10:11,738 --> 00:10:14,615
但你老是说女子拳击既没吸引力也打的不好
But you always said the Foxy Boxing girls were neither foxy not good at boxing.

274
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:16,916
我准备好去证明我是错的
I'm ready to be proven wrong.

275
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:18,067
今晚?
Tonight?

276
00:10:18,067 --> 00:10:18,834
今晚
Tonight.

277
00:10:18,834 --> 00:10:19,793
打吧
Dial.

278
00:10:20,848 --> 00:10:23,630
Tanya, 事实证明知道明天我才参加和平队
Tanya,turns out I don't leave for the Peace Corps till tomorrow.

279
00:10:24,205 --> 00:10:25,068
是的，我知道
Yeah,I know.

280
00:10:25,068 --> 00:10:25,931
很糟糕
It sucks.

281
00:10:25,931 --> 00:10:28,329
我去帮助人的日子又少了一天
Just one fewer day I get to help people.

282
00:10:28,713 --> 00:10:30,918
无论如何, 这女孩 知道她是谁吗?
Anyway,this girl,any idea who she was?

283
00:10:31,494 --> 00:10:32,549
等等
Hold on.

284
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:33,795
她穿什么样的鞋...
What kind of shoes was sh...

285
00:10:33,795 --> 00:10:35,138
不, Tanya, 他是个男的
no,Tanya,he's a dude.

286
00:10:35,138 --> 00:10:37,344
他不会注意她穿什么样的鞋
He's not gonna know what kind of shoes
she was wearing.

287
00:10:37,344 --> 00:10:38,591
事实上...
Actually...

288
00:10:38,591 --> 00:10:39,933
拜托
come on.

289
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:45,112
接下来想做什么?
So what do you want to do next?

290
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:45,783
别考虑
don't think.

291
00:10:45,783 --> 00:10:47,318
脑海里浮现出的第一件事
First thing that comes into your mind.

292
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,483
拿着...
hold...

293
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,921
这个...
this...

294
00:10:51,921 --> 00:10:53,264
还有这个...
and this...

295
00:10:56,237 --> 00:10:57,771
噢 她真厉害
Oh There she goes.

296
00:10:58,155 --> 00:11:01,032
显然她穿着棕色...
Apparently she was wearing brown shoes...

297
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,731
...上面装饰着雪花
...with little snowflakes on them.

298
00:11:06,978 --> 00:11:08,609
是啊 听起来是很可爱
Yeah they do sound cute.

299
00:11:09,184 --> 00:11:11,006
知道是谁...?
Any idea who...?

300
00:11:11,678 --> 00:11:12,445
好吧
Okay.

301
00:11:12,445 --> 00:11:13,404
还是谢谢你
thanks anyway.

302
00:11:13,404 --> 00:11:14,363
你保重...
you take ca...

303
00:11:14,363 --> 00:11:15,418
什么...?
what's...?

304
00:11:15,897 --> 00:11:16,952
今晚?
Tonight?

305
00:11:18,007 --> 00:11:19,350
我明天很早就要起航
I'm shipping out pretty early,

306
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,788
所以我大概不能过夜了
so I won't be able to stay over,

307
00:11:20,788 --> 00:11:22,323
但,耶，当然 我很乐意
but,yeah,sure,I'd love to.

308
00:11:22,323 --> 00:11:24,049
好的 晚点找你
Okay. I'll talk to you later.

309
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,639
抱歉, Ted,我今晚不能去看女子拳击了
Sorry,Ted,I won't be able to make
foxy Boxing tonight.

310
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:27,981
我理解
I understand.

311
00:11:27,981 --> 00:11:29,899
好吧, 别灰心
Okay,let's not lose hope.

312
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:31,338
我们打到酒店去
We'll call the hotel.

313
00:11:31,338 --> 00:11:32,776
也许她还在那
Maybe she was staying there.

314
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:35,654
我们可以让他们查下入住名单看有么叫Victoria的
We'll have them check the registry for anyone named Victoria.

315
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:37,668
也许她叫Vicky或者Tori...
Or maybe she goes by Vicky or Tori...

316
00:11:37,668 --> 00:11:38,818
或者Ictor
or Ictor.

317
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:42,271
她当然不叫Ictor
She probably doesn't go by "Ictor."

318
00:11:44,477 --> 00:11:45,723
不, 你知道吗?
No,you know what?

319
00:11:45,723 --> 00:11:46,874
这就是命运
This is fate.

320
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:48,313
我再也见不到那女孩了
I am never supposed to see this girl again.

321
00:11:48,313 --> 00:11:49,560
这就是昨晚的重点
That was the whole point of the night.

322
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,861
我注定一个人
I have just been saved from myself.

323
00:11:51,861 --> 00:11:52,916
我们来狂饮吧
Let's drink many beers.

324
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,163
同意
Agreed.

325
00:11:54,163 --> 00:11:55,697
我以为就那样结束了
And I thought that was the end of it.

326
00:11:55,793 --> 00:11:56,657
但是后来...
But then...

327
00:12:02,507 --> 00:12:04,041
嘿 我们的女主持人!
There's the anchor lady!

328
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,000
主持的怎么样?
How was it?

329
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,767
我不知道
I don't know.

330
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,165
为什么不问问新来的代打女主持?
Why don't you ask the new substitute
weend anchor?

331
00:12:08,165 --> 00:12:09,028
Robin?
Robin?

332
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:09,699
谢谢, Robin!
Thanks,Robin!

333
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:10,754
太棒了
It was awesome.

334
00:12:10,754 --> 00:12:12,385
支持你, Robin
Back to you,Robin.

335
00:12:12,385 --> 00:12:13,248
恭喜!
Congrats!

336
00:12:13,248 --> 00:12:14,782
太酷了!
That's so cool!

337
00:12:14,782 --> 00:12:16,892
但我对放了Ted鸽子感到很抱歉
I felt really bad bailing on Ted,though.

338
00:12:16,892 --> 00:12:18,331
不用担心了
don't even worry about it.

339
00:12:18,331 --> 00:12:19,290
事实上...
In fact...

340
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:21,400
然后Lily告诉了她整个故事
and then Lily told her the whole story,

341
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,277
包括她穿的棕色带着雪花装饰的鞋
right down to the brown shoes with
the little snowflakes on them.

342
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,291
然后最后...
And by the end of it...

343
00:12:27,442 --> 00:12:28,305
什么?
what?

344
00:12:29,168 --> 00:12:30,798
我知道她是谁
I know who she is.

345
00:12:33,867 --> 00:12:35,594
你知道她是谁?
You know who she is?

346
00:12:35,594 --> 00:12:37,512
但你甚至没有参加婚礼
But you weren't even at the wedding.

347
00:12:37,512 --> 00:12:40,389
事实上, 某种程度上... 我参加了
Actually,I kind of... was.

348
00:12:40,772 --> 00:12:42,499
什么?
What?

349
00:12:42,499 --> 00:12:43,458
新闻结束后
after the newscast,

350
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:46,335
我很激动 决定去婚礼给Ted一个惊喜
I was so excited I decided to surprise Ted
by going to the reception.

351
00:13:00,433 --> 00:13:01,584
该死!
damn it!

352
00:13:01,584 --> 00:13:03,214
别哭!
stop it!

353
00:13:03,214 --> 00:13:04,365
到底怎么了!
what the hell!

354
00:13:05,228 --> 00:13:06,283
你好?
Hello?

355
00:13:06,762 --> 00:13:08,201
你还好吧?
You okay in there?

356
00:13:08,489 --> 00:13:09,927
我很好
I'm fine.

357
00:13:10,503 --> 00:13:12,996
只是过敏或者别的什么
just allergies or something.

358
00:13:12,996 --> 00:13:14,243
我很好
I'm fine.

359
00:13:15,969 --> 00:13:17,504
听着, 你...
Listen,do you...

360
00:13:17,504 --> 00:13:19,613
想出来放声大哭吗?
want to come and cry out here?

361
00:13:19,613 --> 00:13:21,915
我被告知是个不错的安慰者
I've been told I'm an excellent hugger.

362
00:13:21,915 --> 00:13:22,970
谢谢
thanks.

363
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:26,614
但我不会在人前哭泣...
but I don't actually cry in front of
people or...

364
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:29,683
或者根本不会为了这种事哭
cry at all,for that matter.

365
00:13:30,547 --> 00:13:32,177
天, 好恶心
man,it's gross.

366
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,821
每个人哭的时候都会流那么多鼻涕吗?
Does everyone snot up this much when they cry?

367
00:13:36,876 --> 00:13:38,698
你在和一个同样的鼻涕虫说话
you're speaking to a fellow snotter.

368
00:13:41,671 --> 00:13:43,014
恩, 你为什么哭?
so,why are you crying?

369
00:13:43,494 --> 00:13:45,891
因为你喜欢Ted
Because you have feelings for Ted.

370
00:13:46,275 --> 00:13:47,713
我不知道
I don't know.

371
00:13:47,713 --> 00:13:48,864
也许?
Maybe?

372
00:13:48,864 --> 00:13:51,070
好了, 你们两个到底怎么了!
Okay,what is wrong with the two of you!

373
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,413
说真的!
Seriously!

374
00:13:52,413 --> 00:13:54,043
他喜欢你你喜欢他
He likes you and you like him.

375
00:13:54,043 --> 00:13:56,441
那就在一起就好了!
And j...j...just be together!

376
00:13:56,441 --> 00:13:57,112
我的天那!
Cheese louise!

377
00:13:57,112 --> 00:13:59,030
幸福没那么困难吧!
Happiness is not that difficult!

378
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,564
听着, 好吧, 是的
Look,okay,yes.

379
00:14:00,564 --> 00:14:02,866
我在卫生间里哭而且...
I cried in the bathroom and that...

380
00:14:02,866 --> 00:14:03,729
那很怪
was weird.

381
00:14:03,729 --> 00:14:06,223
但并不表示我喜欢上了那家伙
But that doesn't mean I'm in love with the guy.

382
00:14:06,223 --> 00:14:09,004
事实是, 我 我不知道我的感觉
The fact is,I...I don't know how I feel.

383
00:14:09,004 --> 00:14:10,347
不, 你知道!
Yes,you do!

384
00:14:10,347 --> 00:14:12,936
看见他和别人在一起然后哭泣?
Seeing him with someone else and crying about it?

385
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:13,512
猜怎样?
Guess what?

386
00:14:13,512 --> 00:14:14,854
这就是你有感觉
That's how you feel.

387
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,348
这绝对就是你有感觉
That is nothing but how you feel.

388
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:19,266
好了, 好吧
Okay,fine.

389
00:14:19,266 --> 00:14:21,280
我对他有感觉 高兴了?
I have feelings for him. Happy?

390
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,006
可以说, 是啊
Kinda,yeah.

391
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,650
但这并不能改变什么
But it doesn't change anything.

392
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:30,527
我还是不想结婚他仍然是... Ted
I still don't want to get married and he's
still...Ted.

393
00:14:31,254 --> 00:14:34,131
我要做的就是告诉他谁是Victoria让他开心
What I should do is just tell him who
Victoria is so he can be happy.

394
00:14:35,186 --> 00:14:39,063
或者你告诉他你喜欢他,然后你们两个都开心了
Or you could tell him that you're into him and then you could both be happy.

395
00:14:39,693 --> 00:14:41,228
我现在去找他
I'm gonna go find him.

396
00:14:42,762 --> 00:14:43,529
等下
wait

397
00:14:44,393 --> 00:14:46,311
你要告诉他哪一个?
which one are you going to tell him?

398
00:14:47,174 --> 00:14:48,325
我也不知道
I have no idea.

399
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:51,298
然后就是最精彩的部分了
And here's the most amazing part

400
00:14:51,298 --> 00:14:54,175
因为我告诉他我把所有的钱都换成印度币了
because I told her I'd converted all
my money to India dollars,

401
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,436
她就给了我50块坐计程车去机场
she gave me 50 bucks to take a cab to the airport.

402
00:14:57,436 --> 00:14:58,299
对了
That's right.

403
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:00,217
我靠做爱挣钱了
I just got paid for sex.

404
00:15:01,272 --> 00:15:02,614
我真的该把这钱捐给和平队
I really should give this money to the 
Peace Corps.

405
00:15:02,614 --> 00:15:04,628
他们最近为我做了这么多好事
They've done so much for me lately.

406
00:15:04,628 --> 00:15:05,971
嗨, 伙计们
Hi,guys.

407
00:15:07,697 --> 00:15:09,424
Ted, 我能和你在外面聊几句吗?
Ted,can I talk to you outside for a second?

408
00:15:09,424 --> 00:15:10,383
当然
sure.

409
00:15:10,383 --> 00:15:11,246
怎么了?
What's up?

410
00:15:12,205 --> 00:15:14,219
我, 我有事得告诉你
I,I have to tell you something.

411
00:15:15,945 --> 00:15:17,096
接电话吧
just get it.

412
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:18,726
喂?
Hello?

413
00:15:18,726 --> 00:15:19,493
Ted?
Ted?

414
00:15:19,493 --> 00:15:20,644
我是Stuart
It's Stuart.

415
00:15:20,644 --> 00:15:23,521
我可爱的新娘有话对你说
My lovely bride would like to say something
to you.

416
00:15:27,837 --> 00:15:29,467
Ted...
Ted...

417
00:15:29,467 --> 00:15:32,249
很抱歉我之前挂你电话
I'm sorry I hung up on you earlier.

418
00:15:32,249 --> 00:15:33,879
我的新婚丈夫
My new husband,

419
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:35,318
还有草莓伏特加
and the vodka cranberry,

420
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:38,195
在鬼机场花了$10.50...
which cost $10.50 at the freakin' airport bar...

421
00:15:39,058 --> 00:15:41,168
这航班什么时候才开始登机啊?!
when is this plane going to board?!

422
00:15:41,168 --> 00:15:42,415
小甜豆?
Sweet pea?

423
00:15:45,004 --> 00:15:46,922
...让我意识到
...have helped me realize that

424
00:15:46,922 --> 00:15:49,799
有时候我象个疯子
sometimes I can act like a crazy person,

425
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:53,060
我不想我的丈夫认为我是个疯子
and I don't want my new husband to think
I'm a crazy person.

426
00:15:54,307 --> 00:15:56,800
没事, Claudia, 别担心
It's fine,Claudia,don't worry about it.

427
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,061
Marshall想知道你们在哪买的蛋糕
Marshall wanted to know where you guys got
that cake.

428
00:16:00,061 --> 00:16:01,212
蛋糕?
The cake?

429
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,472
把这个拿着?
Why don't you take this?

430
00:16:06,103 --> 00:16:07,733

432
00:16:09,076 --> 00:16:10,706
你真贴心

433
00:16:11,569 --> 00:16:14,159
你是新娘还是新郎的朋友?
So are you a friend of the bride or groom?

434
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:16,365
我们在市区一个小面包房买的
We got it at this little bakery downtown.

435
00:16:16,365 --> 00:16:17,995
事实上都不是
Actually neither.

436
00:16:17,995 --> 00:16:19,625
叫奶油花面包房
It's called the Buttercup Bakery.

437
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,543
很高兴认识你, 奶油花
Pleased to meet you,Buttercup.

438
00:16:21,543 --> 00:16:22,982
我是做蛋糕的
I made the cake.

439
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,681
她是做蛋糕的
She made the cake.

440
00:16:32,196 --> 00:16:37,855
奶油花面包房...她不在嘉宾名单上是因为她不是嘉宾,她是做蛋糕的
Buttercup Bakery...she wasn't on the guest list because she wasn't a guest.She made the cake

441
00:16:37,855 --> 00:16:37,916

442
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:37,925

443
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:41,852
她做的蛋糕?Ted, 就是她了
She made that cake?Ted,this is the girl.

444
00:16:41,853 --> 00:16:43,004
你得娶了她
You got to marry her.

445
00:16:43,004 --> 00:16:43,771
就今天
Today.

446
00:16:43,771 --> 00:16:45,402
她得搬来和我们一起住
She has to move in with us.

447
00:16:45,402 --> 00:16:46,553
我现在就去那个面包房
I'm going down to that bakery.

448
00:16:46,553 --> 00:16:47,607
别, 别 别去
No,no. Don't do it.

449
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:49,430
宝贝, 你在说什么呢?!
Baby,what are you talking about?!

450
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,362
整天你都在帮忙想办法找那个女孩
all day long you been busting my apple-bag
about finding this girl.

451
00:16:53,362 --> 00:16:55,376
我 我只是在想...
I-I just think that...

452
00:16:55,376 --> 00:16:57,294
也许她不是那么喜欢你
that maybe she's not that into you.

453
00:16:57,294 --> 00:17:00,171
这就是为什么她没有给你留电话
And-and that's why she didn't give you
her number.

454
00:17:01,418 --> 00:17:02,473
Robin?
Robin?

455
00:17:02,473 --> 00:17:04,774

456
00:17:06,501 --> 00:17:07,651
好

457
00:17:08,515 --> 00:17:09,953

00:17:17,242 --> 00:17:18,201
知道为什么吗? 因我要说
You know why? Cause I'm going to say it,

463
00:17:18,201 --> 00:17:19,448
这次, 你准备好说好了吗

464
00:17:19,448 --> 00:17:20,503

466
00:17:22,133 --> 00:17:22,996

468
00:17:24,147 --> 00:17:25,777
拜托!
come on!

469
00:17:27,983 --> 00:17:29,518
看起来我们离开有一会了
Guess we were gone a while.

470
00:17:29,518 --> 00:17:31,052
这太可惜了
that's too bad.

471
00:17:31,052 --> 00:17:33,545
我很期待最后那支舞呢
I was looking forward to one last dance.

472
00:17:54,069 --> 00:17:55,220
为什么, 是啊, 我是

473
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:58,193
抱歉, 我可以看出你在想什么
Sorry,I could tell what you were just thinking.

474
00:17:58,193 --> 00:18:00,015
我刚在想什么?
what was I just thinking?

475
00:18:00,015 --> 00:18:02,892
"该死, 他穿这礼服太棒了"
"Damn,he's looking mighty fine in that tux."

476
00:18:03,372 --> 00:18:04,139
你说对了

477
00:18:04,139 --> 00:18:05,577
你真不错
You are good.

478
00:18:06,249 --> 00:18:08,263
你知道, 我并不是每天都这样穿
You know,I don't look like this every day.

479
00:18:08,263 --> 00:18:09,126
在现实的周末
On a real weekend,

480
00:18:09,126 --> 00:18:12,003
现实里的Ted穿着牛仔裤和洗的发白的T恤
the real Ted wears a pair of jeans and
a sweatshirt with bleach stains on it.

481
00:18:13,921 --> 00:18:16,415
现实里的Ted听起来很性感
The real Ted sounds real sexy.

482
00:18:18,045 --> 00:18:19,963
我再也看不到你太可惜了
Too bad I'll never get to see it.

483
00:18:25,525 --> 00:18:26,868
奶油花面包房
Buttercup Bakery.

484
00:18:26,868 --> 00:18:27,827
就这了
This is it.

485
00:18:27,827 --> 00:18:29,170
祝你好运, 伙计
Good luck,dude.

486
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,704
给我弄块蛋糕来
Grab me a cupcake.

487
00:18:33,677 --> 00:18:34,732
Ted?
Ted?

488
00:18:34,732 --> 00:18:36,267
你有听我们说吗?
You still with us?

489
00:18:48,734 --> 00:18:50,269
告诉我你的姓
tell me your last name.

490
00:18:53,913 --> 00:18:56,215
你知道我们的计划里有点缺陷
You know there's one little flaw in our plan.

491
00:18:56,215 --> 00:18:57,461
那是什么?
What's that?

492
00:18:57,461 --> 00:18:59,955
我们会带着许多美好回忆
I'm going to go home tonight with a lot 
of great memories

493
00:18:59,955 --> 00:19:02,736
和一个烂回忆回家
and one really sucky memory.

494
00:19:03,024 --> 00:19:05,517
那就是我看着你走掉的回忆
The memory of you walking out that door.

495
00:19:09,258 --> 00:19:10,217
嘿，Ted
Hey,Ted.

496
00:19:12,998 --> 00:19:14,245
闭上眼...
Close your eyes...

497
00:19:15,396 --> 00:19:16,930
数到5
and count to five.

498
00:19:20,287 --> 00:19:21,342
1...
One...

499
00:19:22,301 --> 00:19:23,260
2...
two...

500
00:19:24,123 --> 00:19:25,178
3...
three...

501
00:19:26,904 --> 00:19:27,959
4...
four...

502
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,028
5
five.

503
00:19:42,345 --> 00:19:43,591
直到我们死去
And to our dying days

504
00:19:43,591 --> 00:19:47,468
我们也会记得这个完美的夜晚
we'll remember everything about that night
as perfect.

505
00:19:49,058 --> 00:19:50,976
也许我们都需要那样
Maybe we both need that.

506
00:19:50,976 --> 00:19:52,798
我是说, 生活里有那么多不如意
I mean,so many things go wrong in life

507
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:54,908
但有一件永远不会被破坏
but this is the one thing that never will.

508
00:19:54,908 --> 00:19:56,826
它将会...
It will always...

509
00:19:57,497 --> 00:20:00,375
永远纯净不被污染
always be pure unadulterated awesome.

510
00:20:02,388 --> 00:20:03,060
但如果我走进那里
And if I walk in there,

511
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,594
我就会把它夺走...
I'm robbing both of us...

512
00:20:04,594 --> 00:20:05,937
出租车计费器还在走呢, 伙计
the meter's running,dude.

513
00:20:05,937 --> 00:20:07,759
抓住机会
Crap or get off the pot.

514
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:08,910
我去了
I'm going.

515
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,229
噢, 谢天谢地
Oh,thank god.

516
