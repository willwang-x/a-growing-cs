00:00:12,587 --> 00:00:15,713
那么, 孩子们, 你们想听
我变聋的那个故事吗?
So,kids,would you like to hear the story of the time I went deaf?

4
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:16,557
他干嘛问我们?
Why does he even ask?

5
00:00:16,577 --> 00:00:18,514
是啊, 无论如何他
都会讲给我们听
I know,he's just going to tell us anyway.

6
00:00:18,591 --> 00:00:19,770
我确实会讲
I sure am.

7
00:00:19,847 --> 00:00:23,098
故事的开始
是Robin来到酒吧说……
It all began when robin strolled into the bar and said...

8
00:00:23,175 --> 00:00:24,105
说你是我的小贱人
say you're my bitch.

9
00:00:24,153 --> 00:00:26,474
我是你的小贱人
这次是为什么?
I'm your bitch. Why this time?

10
00:00:26,531 --> 00:00:30,761
因为今晚
我将把大家全带进Okay
Cause tonight I'm getting us all into okay.

11
00:00:30,838 --> 00:00:32,688
"Okay" 太棒了!
"Okay," awesome!

12
00:00:32,736 --> 00:00:34,942
怎么回事? 我刚才中风了吗?
What's going on? Did I just have a stroke?

13
00:00:35,163 --> 00:00:36,486
Okay是一个夜总会的名字
Okay is the name of a club.

14
00:00:36,582 --> 00:00:38,519
对, 这有点让人难以置信
Yeah,it's supposed to be incredibly exclusive.

15
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:41,435
有一次我和朋友在外面
等了两个小时, 还是进不去
This friend of mine once waited outside for two hours,couldn't get in.

16
00:00:41,483 --> 00:00:43,420
你的朋友叫"你"?
A friend of yours named you?

17
00:00:43,468 --> 00:00:46,518
不, 我的朋友叫"闭嘴"
No,a friend of mine named shut up.

18
00:00:46,642 --> 00:00:47,899
好吧, 夜总会的老板
和我去同一个健身馆
Yeah,well,the owner goes to my gym.

19
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:51,265
结果发现他是我播报的
都市新闻的忠实观众
It turns out that he is a fan of my reporting for metro news one.

20
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:52,895
所以我在今晚出席的名单上
So now I'm on the list for tonight.

21
00:00:52,963 --> 00:00:54,219
干的不错, Sherbotsky
Nice going,sherbotsky.

22
00:00:54,267 --> 00:00:57,317
你又长又难拼的名字
变得家喻户晓了
You're becoming a long and difficult-to-spell household name.

23
00:00:57,556 --> 00:00:59,273
他甚至把我列入了V.I.P. 房的名单
He's even getting me into the V.I.P. Room.

24
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:03,291
对, 他只是想让你看看他的V.I.P. 
如果你知道我在说什么
Yeah,he just wants to show you his own V.I.P.,If you know what I mean.

25
00:01:03,387 --> 00:01:07,540
好吧, 在你的小世界里V.I.P. 代表什么?
All right,what does V.I.P. Stand for in your little universe?

26
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:10,407
嗯, 我知道"p"表示阴茎
Well,I know that "p" is penis.

27
00:01:10,954 --> 00:01:14,052
好吧, 你们两个会跟我一起去
我应该邀请Marshal和Lily吗?
Great,so you guys are in. Should I invite marshal and lily?

28
00:01:14,531 --> 00:01:15,701
有什么好笑的呢?
Why was this funny?

29
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,015
我来解释给你们听
I'll explain.

30
00:01:17,063 --> 00:01:19,317
你们知道, Lily是幼儿园老师
You see,lily was a kindergarten teacher,

31
00:01:19,365 --> 00:01:21,897
命中注定的一次午休时间时……
and so one fateful nap time...

32
00:01:21,954 --> 00:01:25,474
Austin和我在
迷人的小床上共渡周末
austin and I spent saturday night at the most charming little bed and breakfast.

33
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:27,373
那太美妙了
It was so nice.

34
00:01:27,402 --> 00:01:29,396
这个周末你怎么过的?
What did you do this weekend?

35
00:01:29,454 --> 00:01:33,108
来吧, 加油, 咕嘟, 咕嘟, 咕嘟!
Go,come on,chug,chug,chug!

36
00:01:33,185 --> 00:01:34,403
十秒!
Ten conds!

37
00:01:34,499 --> 00:01:38,594
喝干了, 输家!
Suck it,losers!

38
00:01:38,776 --> 00:01:41,979
你知道, 与未婚夫普通平静的日子
you know,quiet time with the fiance

39
00:01:42,612 --> 00:01:45,115
我也不知道, 我就觉得丢脸
I don't know,I just felt embarrassed.

40
00:01:45,163 --> 00:01:49,690
Claire和我同年，她和丈夫享受着
所有成年人做的上等的事情
Claire is my age and she and her husband do all this classy grownup stuff.

41
00:01:49,766 --> 00:01:52,787
也许我们也应该开始做些成熟的事
Maybe we should start doing some grownup stuff.

42
00:01:52,835 --> 00:01:55,118
我们早上做的不就是吗
That's some pretty grownup stuff we did this morning.

43
00:01:55,137 --> 00:01:57,563
对啊, 但不是上等的
Yeah,but it wasn't classy.

44
00:01:58,494 --> 00:02:00,920
也许我们该办个品酒会
Maybe we should have a wine-tasting party.

45
00:02:00,968 --> 00:02:03,711
我喜欢酒 我也喜欢品尝
I like wine. I like tasting.

46
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,691
你知道我能狂欢
来狂欢吧 来摇摆吧 成人风格
You know I can party. Let's do it. Let's rock it. Maturity style.

47
00:02:08,947 --> 00:02:12,035
以后她就会鼓动
他参加读书俱乐部, 烹饪班……
And ever since then she's been signing him up for book clubs,cooking classes...

48
00:02:12,074 --> 00:02:16,092
所有能把下月千元工资花掉的事情
all the things you do when you know where your next thousand lays are coming from

49
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:18,269
所以, 不, Lily和Marshal
l不会和我们一起去
so,no,lily andarshall will not be joining us.

50
00:02:18,317 --> 00:02:20,868
知道了 不管怎样
Ted, 我要说的第二件事
Got it. Anyway,ted,part two of my story:

51
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,527
我朋友kelly也会去
My friend kelly's going to be there.

52
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:24,963
Kelly, 看样子我要爱上她？
Kelly,who supposedly I'm going to love.

53
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:26,105
噢, 你会喜欢上Kelly的
Oh,you are going to love kelly.

54
00:02:26,124 --> 00:02:28,579
她很风趣, 很聪明, 她单身……
She's fun,she's smart,she lives in the moment...

55
00:02:28,608 --> 00:02:32,242
翻译: 她很丑, 她很丑
她是丑人中的丑人
translation: She's ugly,she's ugly,she ugs in the ugly.

56
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,515
噢, 还有她很正点
Oh,and she's totally hot.

57
00:02:34,573 --> 00:02:37,018
好吧, 我猜今晚我可以接手她
Okay,I guess I could take her off your hands for an evening.

58
00:02:37,364 --> 00:02:39,857
那你还有别的正点，单身的朋友吗?
so do you have any other hot,single friends?

59
00:02:39,905 --> 00:02:42,485
没有 Kelly……
No. Kelly...

60
00:02:43,904 --> 00:02:45,563
噢, 天那, Ted, 你的运动衫!
oh,no,ted,your blazer!

61
00:02:45,592 --> 00:02:46,206
怎么, 怎么, 怎么?
What,what,what?

62
00:02:46,254 --> 00:02:48,824
有人弄的如此耀眼
Somebody spilled gorgeous all over it.

63
00:02:48,882 --> 00:02:50,982
--不错
--谢谢
--Love it. 
--Thank you.

64
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,677
瞧他完美的发型
And his hair was perfect.

65
00:02:53,754 --> 00:02:55,595
我们穿了一样的衬衫
We're wearing the same shirt.

66
00:02:55,662 --> 00:02:59,067
噢, 等等, 不, 是
我的衬衫反射在你的上了
Oh,wait,no,that's just my shirt reflected in yours.

67
00:02:59,124 --> 00:03:01,781
女孩们和鱼的24条相同点之一是
One of the 24 similarities between girls and fish is that

68
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:04,274
他们都被发光的物体吸引
they're both attracted to shiny objects.

69
00:03:04,322 --> 00:03:06,691
你从来没看过我的博客, 是不?
You really never read my blog,do you?

70
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:08,494
好吧, 罐头小子, 我们狂欢去吧
All right,tin man,let's hit it.

71
00:03:08,532 --> 00:03:11,208
好吧, 嗯
好好享受你们的迪斯科, 伙计们
All right,well,have fun at your little disco,guys.

72
00:03:11,237 --> 00:03:12,839
你们两到底怎么了?
What the hell happened to these two?

73
00:03:12,886 --> 00:03:14,076
我和Marshall长大了
Marshall and I are just growing up.

74
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,927
对, 这会变的很不错
Yeah,it's going to be sweet,too.

75
00:03:15,984 --> 00:03:17,787
就象今晚, 我们将品尝所有这些不同的酒
Like tonight,we're tasting all these different wines,

76
00:03:17,835 --> 00:03:20,683
与这些美味的奶酪组合起来
pairing them up with these cool gourmet cheeses.

77
00:03:21,614 --> 00:03:24,625
哇, 谁能料到忠于一段异性恋情
Wow,who knew being in a committed heterosexual retionship

78
00:03:24,673 --> 00:03:27,732
……可以让一个男人
变得这么像同性恋？
could make a guy so gay?

79
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,120
好吧, 酷小孩们要走了
All right,cool kids are leaving now.

80
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:34,321
爷爷, 奶奶, 不用等我们了
Grandma,grandpa,don't wait up

81
00:03:42,694 --> 00:03:47,163
天那, 噢, 我的天那
今晚这里有好多辣妹啊
my,oh,my. There are some ferocious-looking cutlets here tonight.

82
00:03:47,988 --> 00:03:51,489
好吧, 勾引计划专栏, 找个辣妹
All right,hookup strategy. Colon,find a cutlet,

83
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,052
早早锁定住她
lock her in early,

84
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,313
整晚纠缠她直到她属于我
grind with her all nightill she's mine.

85
00:03:56,351 --> 00:03:58,422
你这些计划起过作用吗?
Do these strategies ever work for you?

86
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:02,259
应该这样问
这些计划什么时候没起作用?
The question is: Do these strategies ever not work for me?

87
00:04:02,307 --> 00:04:04,637
两个问题, 答案都是一半一半
Either way,the answer is about half the time.

88
00:04:06,181 --> 00:04:10,765
我的小贱人们! 瞧我的
呃,他们是和我一起的
My bitches! Check this out um,they're with me.

89
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:17,210
呃, 我们也是她的小贱人
Um,we're her bitches,too.

90
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,809
我们还是在这等着
Wel wait here.

91
00:04:20,615 --> 00:04:22,187
依据现在的利率情况
And with today's interest rate climate,

92
00:04:22,235 --> 00:04:24,201
你得去申请30年的低压贷款
you've got to go for the 30-year fixed mortgage.

93
00:04:24,278 --> 00:04:26,388
--噢, 是啊
--对
--Oh,totally. 
--Yeah.

94
00:04:26,436 --> 00:04:27,961
嗯, Marshall, 说说你们的事吧?
So,marshall,what about you?

95
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:29,294
你们在考虑买房生小孩吗?
You guys thinking house,baby?

96
00:04:29,342 --> 00:04:34,127
噢! 不, 我们会等等
再考虑生孩子的事
Oh! No,think we're going to wait on the baby thing.

97
00:04:34,511 --> 00:04:36,995
我是说, 我喜欢小孩
小孩很可爱
I mean,I love babies. Babies rule.

98
00:04:37,072 --> 00:04:38,721
小胖胳膊还有……
Pudgy arms and stuff...

99
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:40,879
但是, 呃, 他们让你显老
but,uh,they make you old.

100
00:04:40,927 --> 00:04:43,756
就像把你困在原地
的大铁锚……
Kind of like this anchor weighing you down to one spot...

101
00:04:43,804 --> 00:04:45,578
永远困住
forever.

102
00:04:45,655 --> 00:04:48,638
我怀孕3个月了
I'm three months pregnant.

103
00:04:48,686 --> 00:04:50,690
别觉得尴尬, 伙计们
Not awkward,guys.

104
00:04:50,738 --> 00:04:54,613
别尴尬除非
我们让事情变的尴尬
Not awkward unless we let it be awkward.

105
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:01,077
这地方看起来不错
kelly在这吗?
This place seems great. Is kelly here?

106
00:05:01,124 --> 00:05:02,477
对, 她就在这
Yeah,she's around somewhere.

107
00:05:02,505 --> 00:05:04,280
呃, 我们去找她吧
我会介绍你们认识
Uh,let's go find her. I'll introduce you guys.

108
00:05:04,308 --> 00:05:07,138
然后我就得去V.I.P. 房了
Then I should probably duck into the V.I.P. Room.

109
00:05:07,186 --> 00:05:08,874
这很蠢而且专制, 不是吗?
It's so stupid and arbitrary,isn't it?

110
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:11,214
谁可以去V.I.P房谁不能?
Who gets to be a V.I.P and who doesn't?

111
00:05:11,262 --> 00:05:12,297
我们能去吗?
Can we come?

112
00:05:12,316 --> 00:05:15,424
也不是那么专制
It's not that arbitrary.

113
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:19,475
-哇, 这地方真吵
-你觉得吗?
Whoa,this place is loud. You think?

114
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,049
好吧, 是有点吵
Ok,it is a little loud

115
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,103
Kelly在那边!
There is Kelly

116
00:05:45,298 --> 00:05:47,123
你想去找个能讲话的地方吗?
You want to go somewhere we can talk 

117
00:05:47,124 --> 00:05:49,407
好啊!
Totally!

118
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:54,484
……好吧……
......Okay......

119
00:06:05,438 --> 00:06:08,861
不觉得Ted没有
邀我和他一起出去很奇怪吗?
think it was kind of weird that ted didn't invite me out with him?

120
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:13,446
为什么? 你宁愿去某个夜总会
充满噪音和汗臭味, 还有……
Why? You'd rather be out at some dance club,all noisy and sweaty,with the...

121
00:06:15,316 --> 00:06:16,985
这就是你想要的吗?
is that what you want?

122
00:06:18,567 --> 00:06:20,293
这就是你想要的吗?
is this what you want?

123
00:06:20,341 --> 00:06:22,566
30年的低押借款……
"30-year fixed mortgage...

124
00:06:22,595 --> 00:06:25,482
我怀孕3个月了
I'm three months pregnant."

125
00:06:29,174 --> 00:06:33,154
这是该尴尬的时候了
That was awkward.

126
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:36,789
我们开始品酒吧!
Let's start drinking!

127
00:06:36,837 --> 00:06:39,512
别这么急
要让红酒的单宁酸醇香
Not so fast. In order for the tannins to mellow,

128
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,891
我们应该让它先“呼吸”30分钟
we should let it breathe for about 30 minutes.

129
00:06:43,607 --> 00:06:47,060
该死的单宁酸
Freaking tannins.

130
00:06:58,981 --> 00:07:01,369
那么, 你怎么认识Robin的?
So,how do you know Robin?

131
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:03,504
人马座!
Sagittarius

132
00:07:04,826 --> 00:07:07,353
离威郡很近吗?
Is that near Westchester? 
 
133
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:09,548
我很乐意来一杯!
I would love one!

134
00:07:09,549 --> 00:07:10,942
一瓶啤酒就好了!
Just a beer!

135
00:07:15,965 --> 00:07:17,797
你知道他们现在在干嘛吗?
do you know what they're doing in there right now?

136
00:07:17,845 --> 00:07:19,936
他们在看Claire的超声波录象带
They're watching claire's ultrasound video.

137
00:07:19,993 --> 00:07:23,024
我发誓, 连婴儿自己
都觉得无聊了
And I swear to god,even the baby looks bored.

138
00:07:23,053 --> 00:07:24,885
拜托, 没那么糟糕
Come on,it's not that bad.

139
00:07:24,904 --> 00:07:27,627
我们已经开始溶入这些人了
We're really starting to click with these guys.

140
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:31,675
Claire和Austin刚刚还邀请我们
去参加周六晚的奶酪火锅宴
Claire and austin just invited us to their fondue fest next saturday night.

141
00:07:31,694 --> 00:07:34,341
你是真的想让我
对奶酪火锅感到兴奋吗?
Are you honestly trying to get me excited about fondue?

142
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:38,043
把食物浸在热奶酪里
有什么不让人喜欢的?
It's dipping stuff in hot cheese. What's not to love?

143
00:07:39,088 --> 00:07:41,246
好吧, 听起来是不错
Okay,that does sound good.

144
00:07:41,284 --> 00:07:45,523
但是是与一群乏味的家伙
把食物浸在热奶酪里
But it's dipping stuff in hot cheese with boring people.

145
00:07:45,571 --> 00:07:48,822
Marshall, 我们是时候成熟起来了
Marshall,it's time for us to grow up.

146
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,344
Marshall知道她是对的
Marshall knew she was right.

147
00:07:51,392 --> 00:07:54,298
他必须别再表现的象个小孩
He had to stop acting like a kid.

148
00:07:54,318 --> 00:07:55,996
但不是今晚
But not tonight.

149
00:07:56,696 --> 00:07:59,352
好吧, 我们的公寓在3楼
Now,our apartment was on the third floor,

150
00:07:59,381 --> 00:08:02,210
所以不确定这部分是不是真的
so I'm not sure if this part is actually true,

151
00:08:02,287 --> 00:08:05,807
但是Marshall叔叔发誓
这是真正有发生的
but uncle marshall swears it happened.

152
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:09,979
记程车!
Taxi!

153
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:56,029
新专辑很棒 平静优美
the new album is great. It's all smooth and polished,

154
00:08:56,058 --> 00:08:57,660
不象以前的那些音乐一样
那么节奏很强了
not dark a heavy like the early stuff.

155
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:02,206
噢, 是啊, Nora Jones越来越棒了
Oh,yeah,nora jones just gets better and better.

156
00:09:02,254 --> 00:09:04,450
天那, 告诉我现在能开始品酒了
Please,tell me we can drink the wine now.

157
00:09:04,479 --> 00:09:07,778
再等5分钟, 别弄糟单宁酸
Five more minutes.Don't want to rush those tannins.

158
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,432
该死的单宁酸
Freaking tannins.

159
00:09:16,337 --> 00:09:18,189
你真喜欢这地方吗?
You really like this place?

160
00:09:19,585 --> 00:09:22,204
你不知道我在说什么, 是吗?
You have no idea what I am saying,do you?

161
00:09:25,704 --> 00:09:27,782
我是从外星球来的!
I am from outer space!

162
00:09:29,594 --> 00:09:32,660
我因为上了一只海豚
被赶出海底世界!
I got thrown out of Sea World for humping a dolphin! 

163
00:09:35,772 --> 00:09:39,244
我尿裤子了!
I am wetting my pants!

164
00:09:42,543 --> 00:09:44,145
我就在那时候意识到
I think that's when I realized,

165
00:09:44,164 --> 00:09:45,813
夜总会不是那么棒
clubs weren't awesome.

166
00:09:45,842 --> 00:09:47,587
夜总会一点都不好
Clubs weren't even okay.

167
00:09:48,364 --> 00:09:50,819
夜总会太烂了
Clubs sucked.

168
00:09:50,867 --> 00:09:53,438
我得离开这
I had to get out of there.

169
00:09:53,975 --> 00:09:55,432
--嘿, Robin
--嘿
--Hey,robin. 
--Hey.

170
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,015
--你怎么不在里面?
--我在给那老板打电话
--Why aren't you inside? 
--I'm calling the owner.

171
00:09:57,034 --> 00:09:59,902
里面那家伙不让我进V.I.P. 房
There's a guy in there who won't let me in to the stupid V.I.P. Room.

172
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:01,321
你在这干嘛?
What are you doing here?

173
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,217
噢, 我有这个心情
所以就来这狂欢了
Oh,I had this move,so I came here to bust it.

174
00:10:04,265 --> 00:10:06,586
你能把我弄进去吗?
Can you get me in?

175
00:10:08,811 --> 00:10:10,135
好样的 语音信箱
Great. Voice mail.

176
00:10:10,163 --> 00:10:11,563
--谢谢, 一会见!
--拜!
--Thanks,I'll see you! 
--Bye!

177
00:10:11,592 --> 00:10:13,577
噢, 天那, 他才刚刚到这
Oh,come on,he just got here.

178
00:10:13,597 --> 00:10:15,400
他肯定很有名
He's probably famous.

179
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:18,123
噢, 是啊 Affleck有3兄弟吗?
Oh,yeah. Isn't there a third affleck brother?

180
00:10:18,152 --> 00:10:20,847
Keith Affleck还是
Brian Affleck还是其他什么人?
Keith affleck or brian affleck or something?

181
00:10:20,876 --> 00:10:25,191
天啊, 我们刚刚
看见了Brian Affleck
Holy crap,we just saw brian affleck.

182
00:10:25,518 --> 00:10:28,030
不是我有多在意能进V.I.P. 房
It's not like I care so much about getting in the V.I.P. Room,

183
00:10:28,088 --> 00:10:30,332
我已经去过无数个V.I.P. 房
I have been in tons of V.I.P. Rooms.

184
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,979
我不是第一次进V.I.P. 房
I'm not exactly a V.I.P. Room virgin.

185
00:10:33,027 --> 00:10:35,587
但是真的, 回我电话
But seriously,call me back.

186
00:10:36,834 --> 00:10:38,656
噢, 呃, 我刚刚还在里面
Oh,um,I was just in there,

187
00:10:38,676 --> 00:10:41,207
Robin Sherbotsky 我在单子上
robin sherbotsky. I'm on the list.

188
00:10:41,255 --> 00:10:43,845
名字已经被划掉了 抱歉
Name's already crossed off. Sorry.

189
00:10:43,874 --> 00:10:46,012
但是我是Robin Sherbotsky
But I'm robin sherbotsky.

190
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,815
我是一台的记者
I'm a reporter for channel one.

191
00:10:47,863 --> 00:10:51,488
有一台吗? 到后面去排队
There's a channel one? Back of the line.

192
00:10:51,997 --> 00:10:54,893
应该跟着Brian Affleck溜进去
Should have snuck in with brian affleck.

193
00:11:03,034 --> 00:11:04,558
我要走了, 回头见
I am bailing,see ya.

194
00:11:05,021 --> 00:11:08,130
噢, 嘿, 我看不见她的脸
她辣吗?
Oh hey,I can not see her face.Is she hot? 

195
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,038
嗨
Hi

196
00:11:16,657 --> 00:11:17,677
迷人的眼睛
Nice eyes

197
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:18,705
笑的很可爱
Cute smile

198
00:11:18,706 --> 00:11:20,220
你泡不到的
Out of your league

199
00:11:26,589 --> 00:11:30,540
啊! 外套寄存女佣
别让这家伙取走外套!
Aah! Coat wench,do not uncheck that man's jacket!

200
00:11:30,598 --> 00:11:31,586
抱歉, 只是在演戏
Sorry,just being dramatic.

201
00:11:31,634 --> 00:11:32,516
你不是外套寄存女佣
You're not a coat wench.

202
00:11:32,689 --> 00:11:34,472
不, 不, 不, 外套寄存女佣
我喜欢这个
No,no,no,coat wench,I like it.

203
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,381
我需要一个称号
I should get a sign made up.

204
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,500
你在这干嘛? Lily让你走吗?
What are you doing here? Lily let you go?

205
00:11:38,558 --> 00:11:40,553
Lily? 谁管她, 是不?
Lily? Who cares,right?

206
00:11:40,582 --> 00:11:42,020
--你完了
--噢, 我是完了.
--You are so dead. 
--Oh,I am so dead.

207
00:11:42,058 --> 00:11:43,315
哇, 我要回家了
Wow,I'm going home.

208
00:11:43,372 --> 00:11:46,528
别, 呃 我把我的屁股很有可能还有
我身体的其他部分拿来冒险
No,uh-uh. I put my ass and probably other parts of my body on the line

209
00:11:46,604 --> 00:11:48,801
来这和我的兄弟狂欢
to come down here and party with my bro.

210
00:11:48,829 --> 00:11:50,230
现在, 管他妈的我们去派对吧
Now,damn it we're going to party.

211
00:11:50,258 --> 00:11:52,243
--好吧, 一瓶啤酒
--好!
--All right,one beer. 
--Yes!

212
00:11:52,272 --> 00:11:54,718
太好了, 我终于不需要
等半个小时才能喝酒了
Finally,I don't have to wait a half an hour for a drink.

213
00:11:55,417 --> 00:11:57,923
半小时后
ONE HALF HOUR LETER...

214
00:11:58,138 --> 00:11:58,987
耶!
Yeah! 

215
00:11:59,826 --> 00:12:01,433
没有单宁酸!
No tannins!

216
00:12:01,872 --> 00:12:04,068
噢, 天那, 我不敢相信
我差点忘记告诉你们这个了
Oh,man,Ican't believe I forgot to tell you this.

217
00:12:04,097 --> 00:12:05,382
这是故事里很重要的一部分
This is important to the story.

218
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,658
那天早些时候
Earlier that day,

219
00:12:06,706 --> 00:12:09,736
Marshall去牙医那
装了个临时的假齿冠
marshall went to the dentist and got a temporary crown put in.

220
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:11,981
嗯, 所以无论如何……
Okay,so anyway...

221
00:12:19,936 --> 00:12:20,725
来吧, 我们走!
Come on,Let's go!

222
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:23,069
我要留下来!
I'm staying1

223
00:12:30,413 --> 00:12:33,147
Marshall, 你还好吧?
Marshall,are you okay?

224
00:12:54,642 --> 00:12:55,994
又一次, 我当时不在那
Again,I wasn't there,

225
00:12:56,023 --> 00:12:58,593
所以在细节上我有点模糊
so I'm a little foggy on the details.

226
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:03,322
记程车!
Taxi!

227
00:13:05,975 --> 00:13:07,634
--嘿
--嘿
--Hey. 
--Hey.

228
00:13:07,692 --> 00:13:10,051
Marshall刚刚从我们的派对上溜了
Marshall just ditched out on our own party.

229
00:13:10,099 --> 00:13:12,353
你能让我进去吗? 我要杀了他
Can you get me in there? I kind of need to kill him.

230
00:13:12,401 --> 00:13:15,000
事实上, 我自己都进不去了
Actually,I can't even get myself in.

231
00:13:15,144 --> 00:13:16,429
我真是个呆子
I was such a dork.

232
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:20,476
我被认出来了一次
就觉得自己是Julia Roberts
I get recognized one time,and I start thinking I'm julia roberts.

233
00:13:20,543 --> 00:13:21,915
我不是什么V.I.P.
I'm no V.I.P.

234
00:13:22,394 --> 00:13:23,804
我连I.P. 都不是
I'm not even an I.P.

235
00:13:23,852 --> 00:13:26,086
我只是颗平凡的小小P
I'm just a lowly little pea,

236
00:13:26,134 --> 00:13:28,484
坐在街边台阶上
sitting out here in the gutter.

237
00:13:28,513 --> 00:13:29,913
你知道吗?
You know something?

238
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:33,998
我永远把台阶上的小P
看的比Julia Roberts重
I'd take a pea in the gutter over julia roberts

239
00:13:38,636 --> 00:13:41,594
Barney在那边，我要走了！
There's Barney,I'm leaving1

240
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:50,225
我弄伤牙齿了!
I broke my tooth!

241
00:13:50,245 --> 00:13:51,511
你有……
Do you have... ...

242
00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:53,611
阿司匹林?
any aspirin?

243
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:55,270
也许那里有……
Maybe there's...

244
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:56,996
一台机器……
a machine in... ...

245
00:13:57,524 --> 00:13:59,471
在卫生间
the restroom.

246
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:06,692
那天
Now to this day,

247
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,150
我不知道在那发生了什么事
I don't know what happened in there,

248
00:14:08,227 --> 00:14:10,854
但是几分钟后
当Marshall出来的时候……
but when marshall came out a few minutes later...

249
00:14:21,739 --> 00:14:23,667
--糟糕的一晚?
--是啊
--rough night? 
--Yeah.

250
00:14:24,118 --> 00:14:26,918
这种夜总会应该很有趣, 不是吗?
These clubs are supposed to be fun,right?

251
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,405
为什么我这么讨厌这些呢?
Why do I hate them so much?

252
00:14:28,482 --> 00:14:30,965
因为所有这些
你本该喜欢上的……
Because all of the stuff you're supposed to like..

253
00:14:31,215 --> 00:14:33,114
通常都很糟糕
usually sucks.

254
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:35,636
就象这些夜总会……或者巡航
Like these clubs...or cruises.

255
00:14:36,336 --> 00:14:37,736
或者除夕夜
Or new year's eve.

256
00:14:38,964 --> 00:14:41,640
--或者超级杯比赛（美国最大的橄榄球比赛）
--或者游行
--Or the super bowl. 
--Or parades.

257
00:14:41,908 --> 00:14:44,526
--火箭
--或者游行
--The rockettes. 
--Or parades.

258
00:14:45,121 --> 00:14:47,845
--你已经说过这个了
--我真的很讨厌游行
--You said that already. 
--I really hate parades.

259
00:14:47,902 --> 00:14:49,110
好吧
Okay.

260
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:52,189
他刚刚从我们的派对中溜走了!
He just left in the middle of our own party!

261
00:14:52,247 --> 00:14:54,136
你不会这样做
You don't do that.

262
00:14:54,174 --> 00:14:57,847
除非, 当然你在追
某个已经这么做了的人, 那么……
Unless,of course,you're chasing after somebody who's already done it,and then...

263
00:14:58,269 --> 00:15:00,667
那么我不会觉得有什么
then I think it's okay.

264
00:15:00,744 --> 00:15:03,899
嗯, 我不想站在他那边
但是拜托, 品酒会?
Well,I hate to take his side,but come on,a wine tasting?

265
00:15:03,928 --> 00:15:06,565
下周六有什么大计划
拼字游戏之夜?
What's the big plan for next Saturday,scrale night?

266
00:15:07,265 --> 00:15:09,289
别去看你的邮箱
Don't check your e-mail.

267
00:15:09,634 --> 00:15:11,667
你为什么要变成这类人呢?
Why are you becoming this person?

268
00:15:11,715 --> 00:15:14,985
我听说你在大学时
大胆的激怒了校园巡视队
I heard that in college you flashed a campus tour group on a dare.

269
00:15:15,043 --> 00:15:18,841
有一次是因为比胆量
另外一次是为了好玩
Once on a dare. The other times were just for fun.

270
00:15:19,944 --> 00:15:21,900
我不再是大学生了
I'm not in college anymore.

271
00:15:21,948 --> 00:15:24,691
我很想回到那时候
做我原来的样子, 但是……
I'd love to go back and be that person again,but..

272
00:15:24,768 --> 00:15:27,760
你不能让时间倒退
只能一直向前走
you can't move backwards. You can only go foreword.

273
00:15:27,808 --> 00:15:31,308
呃, 不对, 你能到任何地方
只要你想去
Um,false. You can go wherever you want.

274
00:15:31,356 --> 00:15:33,380
我想问题是, 你想去哪?
I guess the question is,where do you want to go?

275
00:15:33,428 --> 00:15:36,487
我想进这个夜总会
找到我的未婚夫
I want to go into this club and find my fiance.

276
00:15:36,525 --> 00:15:38,626
嗯, 这个办不到
Well,that you can't do.

277
00:15:39,623 --> 00:15:41,177
要赌一下吗?
Want to bet?

278
00:15:41,695 --> 00:15:43,651
跟着我做
Follow my lead.

279
00:15:44,428 --> 00:15:46,279
嘿, 大块头
Hey,big guy.

280
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:50,019
我说跟着我做
I said follow my lead.

281
00:15:50,671 --> 00:15:51,506
拜托, 拜托 跟着她做
Please,please. Follow her lead.

282
00:15:51,611 --> 00:15:53,232
来吧, 快点
Come on. Do it,please.

283
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,706
跟着她, 拜托 对, 快点
Follow her,please. Yes,please.

284
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:04,501
这是我见过最好的
也是唯一见过的四个乳房
those were the four greatest and only breasts I've ever seen.

285
00:16:08,126 --> 00:16:11,703
嗯, 是啊, 如果每个人都
不停的告诉你什么应该是有趣的
Yeah,see,if everyone keeps telling you something is supposed to be fun,

286
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:13,496
--通常都不是那么有趣
--对! 对啊
--it's usually not. 
--Right! Right.

287
00:16:13,554 --> 00:16:17,726
那么, 按照这个逻辑
如果我们说, 出去约会……
So,by that logic,if you and I were to say,go out on a date...

288
00:16:19,241 --> 00:16:21,946
嗯, 那我们就不可能去
任何好玩的地方
well,then we couldn't go anywhere that's supposed to be fun.

289
00:16:21,965 --> 00:16:24,161
是啊 正是如此
Right. The dmv it is.

290
00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:25,331
那么我们一起去洗牙吧
Then we'll get our teeth cleaned.

291
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:28,026
--听起来很糟糕 这是个约会
--好吧!
--Sounds awful. It's a date. 
--Okay!

292
00:16:28,055 --> 00:16:32,169
还有一个大问题需要解决
But there's still one big question that needs to be answered.

293
00:16:33,329 --> 00:16:36,379
你认为这些外套
我一次能穿上多少件?
How many of these coats do you think I can put on all at once?

294
00:17:19,892 --> 00:17:23,095
好吧, 走四步……
okay,for the wedge...

295
00:17:42,237 --> 00:17:43,618
Barney?
Barney?

296
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:46,169
Ted. 拿好你的外套 我们要走了
Ted. Get your coat. We're leaving.

297
00:17:46,217 --> 00:17:48,174
什么…… 发生什么了, 呃……
What... what happened to that,um...

298
00:17:48,327 --> 00:17:49,718
你纠缠的那个辣妹?
cutlet you were grinding with?

299
00:17:49,766 --> 00:17:52,365
--那是我的堂妹Leslie
--什么?!
--That was my cousin leslie. 
--What?!

300
00:17:52,413 --> 00:17:55,990
不, 不, 不 你不会取笑我, Ted
No,no,no. We're not laughing about this,ted.

301
00:17:56,038 --> 00:17:59,040
这不会成为我们接下来
几个月里不停谈论的笑话
This is not gonna be some funny story that we'll be telling in a couple months.

302
00:17:59,087 --> 00:17:59,941
这不会变的象
It's not gonna be like,

303
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:04,295
"嘿, 哈, 记得那次你和……" 
不！！！
"hey,ha,remember that time when you were grinding with..." no.

304
00:18:05,014 --> 00:18:06,117
你知道为什么吗?
And you know why?

305
00:18:06,156 --> 00:18:09,685
因为…… 斜体字…… 
<i>今晚什么事也没有</i></i>
Because...italics... this night did not happen.

306
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,852
你保证你永远永远
You promise me you will never,ever,

307
00:18:11,881 --> 00:18:15,305
永远不会告诉另外一个
活着的人今晚发生了什么
ever tell another living soul what transpired here tonight.

308
00:18:15,343 --> 00:18:16,254
你保证
You promise.

309
00:18:16,302 --> 00:18:17,233
--好吧
--我保证
--All right. 
--Promise.

310
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,445
好吧, 我保证
我们找到Marshall然后走, 好吗?
All right,I promise. Get marshall and go,okay?

311
00:18:20,714 --> 00:18:23,054
嘿, 谢谢你救了我一晚
Hey,thanks for saving my night.

312
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,569
我很快会找你
I'll talk to you soo yeah.

313
00:18:24,598 --> 00:18:26,612
呃, 嘿, 小费, Barney
Um,hey,tiper,barney.

314
00:18:26,641 --> 00:18:27,667
为什么? 我没有寄存外套
Why? I didn't check a coat.

315
00:18:27,715 --> 00:18:29,815
就算我寄存了
原则上来说, 小费……
And even if I did,on principle,tip jars have become so...

316
00:18:29,863 --> 00:18:31,810
笑话: Barney
与一个女孩纠缠整晚……
funny story: Barney was grinding with this girl all night...

317
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:33,738
好吧!
fine!

318
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:38,360
我学了个新把戏
I'm handing a new trick.

319
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:53,053
就那样, Marshall和Lily
重新发现了他们的青春
So,marshall and lily rediscovered their youth.

320
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:54,721
那很不错
It was nice.

321
00:18:55,815 --> 00:18:58,797
后来他们…… 甜的发腻
And then it got... icky.

322
00:19:07,294 --> 00:19:10,603
我们高兴你们今晚来了
I'm really glad you guys came out tonight.

323
00:19:12,425 --> 00:19:14,823
你知道, 兄弟, 我能说几句吗?
You know,dude,can I just say something?

324
00:19:15,983 --> 00:19:18,755
你们出来没邀请让我有点伤心
It kind of hurt that you guys didn't invite me out.

325
00:19:19,196 --> 00:19:22,025
我是说, 我知道自从我订婚后
情形有些变化
I mean,I know things have changed since I got engaged,

326
00:19:22,447 --> 00:19:24,548
但是被邀请的感觉会很好!
but it would have been nice to be asked!

327
00:19:24,605 --> 00:19:25,631
我真抱歉!
I'm sorry!

328
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,055
--我只是以为……
--他们今晚放的歌不错!
--I just assumed... 
--they played some good songs tonight!

329
00:19:29,563 --> 00:19:31,443
--我是说, 以后……
--我知道, 我知道
--I mean,lately... 
--I know,I know.

330
00:19:31,501 --> 00:19:35,596
这就象我们突然变成
两个世界的人了
It just seems like suddenly we're living in two different worlds.

331
00:19:36,123 --> 00:19:38,137
也许你和Barney有更多共同语言
Maybe you've got more in common with barney.

332
00:19:38,185 --> 00:19:39,748
什么?
What?

333
00:19:40,017 --> 00:19:41,417
你疯了吗?
Are you crazy?

334
00:19:41,494 --> 00:19:43,642
你认为我喜欢去这总夜总会吗?
You think I like going to those clubs?

335
00:19:43,719 --> 00:19:46,797
我宁愿去你的品酒会
I'd so much rather go to your fruity little wine tasting.

336
00:19:46,874 --> 00:19:48,428
噢, 天那, 我要吐了
Oh,god,I'm gonna barf.

337
00:19:48,504 --> 00:19:52,139
我的包呢? 我的包呢? 我没事
Where's my purse? Where's my purse? I'm okay.

338
00:19:53,089 --> 00:19:54,345
问题是
The problem is,

339
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:57,673
除非有人能和你在一起
你做不了那些夫妻做的事情
you can't do any of that couple stuff unless you have someone to do it with,

340
00:19:58,008 --> 00:19:59,073
而我要找个伴儿的话
and the only way I'm gonna find that

341
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:02,602
只能和Barney去做些单身傻事
someone is by going out and doing stupid single stuff with barney.

342
00:20:02,641 --> 00:20:04,578
什么?
What?

343
00:20:05,422 --> 00:20:06,640
但是,伙计
But,man,

344
00:20:06,688 --> 00:20:08,433
我找到另一半时
when I find her,

345
00:20:08,452 --> 00:20:11,560
我们也去办个像样的品酒会
we're gonna have some bad-ass wine tastings.

346
00:20:11,617 --> 00:20:13,363
就这么定了
It's a plan.

347
00:20:14,092 --> 00:20:16,489
嘿, 可能就是那个
寄存外套的可爱女孩
Hey,maybe it'll be that cute coat check girl.

348
00:20:16,537 --> 00:20:19,462
对! 可能真会是她
Yeah! Maybe it will be.

349
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:22,013
不是
It wasn'T.

350
00:20:23,011 --> 00:20:24,133
你知道, Ted
You know,ted,

351
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,744
我不想说什么那时候快到了
I don't say this nearly enough,

352
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:30,040
--但是我真的……
--那地方有很棒的色拉!
--but I really... 
--that place has great salads!

353
00:20:38,603 --> 00:20:40,570
<font color=#B5A642>宝贝宝贝，字幕好款不？</font>
下集更精彩，敬请期待，(*^__^*) 嘻嘻……
