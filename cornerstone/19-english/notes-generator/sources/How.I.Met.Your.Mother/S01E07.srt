老爸老妈的罗漫史
第一季 第七集
Drama Name:how i met your mother
Season 1 Episode 07

4
00:00:12,845 --> 00:00:14,044
孩子们, 在我遇见你们妈妈前
Kids,before I met your mother,

5
00:00:14,274 --> 00:00:15,770
当我仍然在寻找我的另一半时
when I was still out there searching,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,477
我学到了一点
I learned something valuable.

7
00:00:17,688 --> 00:00:19,414
那就是爱情不是科学
That love is not a science.

8
00:00:19,491 --> 00:00:20,843
哇, 这真是个伟大的故事, 爸
Wow,that was great story,dad.

9
00:00:20,987 --> 00:00:21,898
我们要去看电视了
We're going to go watch TV.

10
00:00:21,927 --> 00:00:23,950
你们看, 有时候
You see,sometimes in life

11
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:25,485
你必须得接受
you just have to accept that

12
00:00:25,562 --> 00:00:27,288
世界上某些事情是解释不了的
certain things can't be explained.

13
00:00:27,403 --> 00:00:29,235
而且会让人感到震惊
And that's kind of scary.

14
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,508
噢, 天那
Oh,my god.

15
00:00:31,642 --> 00:00:32,754
我知道, 我还在害怕
I know,I'm still shaking.

16
00:00:32,965 --> 00:00:35,056
怎么...? 开个玩笑, 我感冒了
What the...? Joke's on you,I have a cold.

17
00:00:35,795 --> 00:00:36,658
你们还好吧?
Are you guys okay?

18
00:00:36,792 --> 00:00:38,585
又转了一圈, 冲着我和Lily来了!
Another round,and back it up for me and lily!

00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:42,633

- 我们看见公寓里有些东西
-What happened?
- We saw something up in the apartment.

20
00:00:43,505 --> 00:00:44,129
很糟糕的东西
Something bad.

21
00:00:49,288 --> 00:00:50,209
我不知道怎么了
I don't know what it is,

22
00:00:50,343 --> 00:00:53,441
- 但是玛格丽塔让我兴奋（一种鸡尾酒）
- 噢, muchos sexy.
-but margaritas make me sexy.
- Oh,muchos sexy.

23
00:00:53,614 --> 00:00:55,445
Yo quiero, Marshall
Yo quiero,marshall.

24
00:00:58,629 --> 00:01:00,241
噢, 天那
Oh,my god.

25
00:01:04,499 --> 00:01:05,899
那是什么? 绝对是你见过的最疯狂
what was it? Only the craziest,

26
00:01:06,129 --> 00:01:08,488
最难看的老鼠
meanest looking mouse you've ever seen.

27
00:01:08,805 --> 00:01:11,164
老鼠? 亲爱的, 那不是老鼠
Mouse? Sweetie,that wasn't a mouse.

28
00:01:11,423 --> 00:01:13,207
是只巨型蟑螂
That was a huge cockroach.

29
00:01:13,312 --> 00:01:14,521
宝贝, 那是只老鼠
Baby,it was a mouse.

30
00:01:14,732 --> 00:01:15,624
它有须的
It had whiskers.

31
00:01:15,748 --> 00:01:17,398
但那些东西是从它脑袋上冒出来的
But those things coming out of its head,

32
00:01:17,513 --> 00:01:18,606
那些是触角
those were antennae.

33
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:20,630
Marshall被只蟑螂吓跑了
Marshall ran away from a cockroach.

34
00:01:21,196 --> 00:01:22,433
那是老鼠
It was a mouse.

35
00:01:22,663 --> 00:01:24,552
噢, 好, 抱歉, 兄弟
你真是个男人
Oh,yeah,sorry,my bad.You're a man.

36
00:01:25,204 --> 00:01:27,228
噢, 我的报道开始了
Ted, 注意了
Oh,my story is on.Ted,pay attention.

37
00:01:27,401 --> 00:01:28,619
Carl, 开电视
Carl,turn it up.

38
00:01:28,734 --> 00:01:29,990
在我身边的是Ellen Pierce

42
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:38,967

- 科学
-What's your secret?
-Science.

43
00:01:39,034 --> 00:01:40,002
生活中的每件事
Everything in life

44
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,927
都能被分解为数字, 甚至于爱情
can be broken down to ones and zeros,even love.

45
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:45,248
我所要做的就是把这些不定因素
All I have to do is input the variables,

46
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:47,454
放入系统中, 然后就可以宣布
run the algorithm,and presto manifesto,

47
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,120
你有一个灵魂伴侣啦
这完全是可行的!
you have a soul mate,and it works!

48
00:01:50,494 --> 00:01:53,765
只要去问问我促成的
那些夫妻就知道了
Just ask all of my happy couples.

49
00:01:53,995 --> 00:01:55,999
这只是比较有吸引力的一部分
And these are just the attractive ones.

50
00:01:56,248 --> 00:01:58,042
浴室里还有更多照片
I have more photos in the bathroom.

51
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:00,507
恋爱配对中心, Ellen Pierce

52
00:02:00,679 --> 00:02:03,317
纽约失恋者们的一线希望
A beacon of hope for new york city's lovelorn.

53
00:02:03,326 --> 00:02:04,429
Robin Scherbotsky...
Robin scherbotsky... was that

54
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,012
最后面那个女的真的是客户吗?
chick at the end really a client?

55
00:02:06,146 --> 00:02:07,661
- 嗯
- 我们要去那
Yes. We're signing up.

56
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:10,039
- 什么?
- Ted, 这些女人绝望而且性感
What? Ted,these chicks are desperate and hot.

57
00:02:10,164 --> 00:02:11,689
这是完美的鸡尾酒
That's a perfect cocktail.

58
00:02:11,852 --> 00:02:14,163
摇匀, 然后上床
Shake well,then sleep with.

59
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:16,177
我不会去找配偶师
I'm not going to a matchmaker.

60
00:02:16,331 --> 00:02:17,424
这象放弃希望
That's like giving up.

61
00:02:17,597 --> 00:02:19,515
这是找只猫过晚年的男性版
It's the man version of getting a cat.

62
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,260
不, 那不是蟑螂
No,it wasn't a cockroach.

63
00:02:21,414 --> 00:02:23,418
它有皮毛, 只有哺乳动物有皮毛
It had fur,and only mammals have fur.

64
00:02:23,552 --> 00:02:25,001
那就是只蟑螂
It was a cockroach.

65
00:02:25,135 --> 00:02:26,027
拜托, Lily
Come on,lily,

66
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:27,024
除非它是只披着
the only way that

67
00:02:27,043 --> 00:02:28,031
死老鼠皮的蟑螂
that was a cockroach

68
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,004
才有可能
is if it was wearing the skin of a mouse it just killed.


69
00:02:31,177 --> 00:02:33,776
噢, 天那
Oh,my god.

70
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:35,732
拜托
come on.

71
00:02:45,725 --> 00:02:47,816
Ted! 快点!
你得帮帮我
ted! hurry! You've got to help me.

72
00:02:47,979 --> 00:02:48,718
我的船要沉啦!
My boat is sinking!

73
00:02:48,842 --> 00:02:49,686
- 什么?
- 我的船要沉啦!
-What?
- My boat is sinking!

74
00:02:49,725 --> 00:02:50,271
你有船吗?
You have a boat?

75
00:02:50,377 --> 00:02:51,422
是啊, 我去年在警察拍卖会上买的
Yes,I bought a boat last year at a police auction.

76
00:02:51,623 --> 00:02:52,793
我刚接到了一个在码头的家伙的电话
I just got a call from a guy down at the marina

77
00:02:52,937 --> 00:02:54,549
它向右倾斜了45度角
that it's leaning starboard at a 45 degree angle.

78
00:02:54,644 --> 00:02:55,325
如果我现在不去那的话
If I don't get down there right now,

79
00:02:55,421 --> 00:02:57,128
船就要翻啦 快走吧!
it's going to capsize. Now come on!

80
00:03:00,418 --> 00:03:03,822
- 你的船沉了 这真不错
- 拜托, Ted
-Your boat is sinking. That was good.
- Come on,ted.

81
00:03:03,966 --> 00:03:06,057
这是个难以另人置信的机会
This is an incredible opportunity.

82
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:07,908
我们将碰到灵魂伴侣
We'll meet our soul mates,

83
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,143
上了她们然后消失
nail 'em and never call 'em again.

84
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:13,125
好了吗, 先生们?
All finished,gentlemen?

85
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:14,410
恭喜你们
Congratulations.

86
00:03:14,429 --> 00:03:16,280
你们刚刚迈出了第一步
You have just taken your very first step.

87
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:17,729
天那, 谢谢你, Ellen
Gosh,thanks,ellen.

88
00:03:17,853 --> 00:03:19,388
我很相信这能帮到我
I sure hope this works.

89
00:03:19,503 --> 00:03:21,296
我已经厌倦了单身生活
I'm so done with the single life--

90
00:03:21,517 --> 00:03:24,384
所有的这些游戏, 无意义的性爱
all the games,the meaningless sex.

91
00:03:24,547 --> 00:03:26,513
你应该得到更多
You deserve more.

92
00:03:26,676 --> 00:03:28,489
确实如此, Ellen
That is so true,ellen.

93
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:32,037
我真觉得我应该停止单身
I really think I'm ready to stop being a me,

94
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,147
开始2个人的生活
and start being a we.

95
00:03:34,282 --> 00:03:35,020
嘿
Hey,is there any way

96
00:03:35,126 --> 00:03:36,986
我能说我喜欢拥抱吗?
I can let it be known that I love cuddling?

97
00:03:38,175 --> 00:03:41,436
啊, 当然可以
这太... 噢
Ah,of course you can.That is so... oh.

98
00:03:43,383 --> 00:03:45,128
Ted在这我不好意思说出口
Kind of hard to talk about with ted here,

99
00:03:45,512 --> 00:03:47,766
但我想要的人是不会
but I just want someone who's not afraid

100
00:03:48,073 --> 00:03:50,230
在夜晚害怕搂住我...
to hold me at night...

101
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,724
当我哭泣的时候
When the tears come.

102
00:03:53,827 --> 00:03:55,812
Ellen, 你能帮我找到这样一个她吗?
Ellen,can you help me find her?

103
00:03:56,013 --> 00:03:58,258
- 滚出去
- 怎么?
-Get out.
-What?

104
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,470
每天都会有15个象你这样的家伙
I get 15 guys like you every week.

105
00:04:01,624 --> 00:04:03,408
想找容易上手的女人
Jerks who just want to meet vulnerable women,

106
00:04:03,571 --> 00:04:05,546
上了她然后消失掉
nail 'em and never call 'em again.

107
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:07,829
噢, 天那, 有人会这样吗?
Oh,my god,people do that?

108
00:04:07,944 --> 00:04:08,692
你想用什么方式出去
Do you want to do this

109
00:04:08,817 --> 00:04:09,824
舒服点的还是痛苦点的?
the easy way or the hard way?

110
00:04:09,987 --> 00:04:10,840
比较痛苦的是什么?
What's the hard way?

111
00:04:11,022 --> 00:04:13,756
保安把我给丢出去吗?
Security roughs me up and tosses me out?

112
00:04:13,842 --> 00:04:14,916
不, 那是比较舒服的方式
No,that's the easy way.

113
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:15,693
比较痛苦的是
The hard way is that

114
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,659
我亲自把你给踢出去
I stomp the crap out of you myself.

115
00:04:18,081 --> 00:04:19,155
好吧, Ted, 我们走
Okay,ted,let's go.

116
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:21,169
不是你 你留下来
Not you. You stay.

117
00:04:22,675 --> 00:04:25,245
你很讨人喜欢，你是个设计师
You're cute. You're an architect.

118
00:04:25,427 --> 00:04:27,163
不错的职业
Good career,

119
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:29,359
你也没有在简历上用很明显的假名
and you didn't use an obvious alias on your application,


120
00:04:29,494 --> 00:04:32,025
比方说你的朋友Jack Package
like your friend jack package.

121
00:04:32,716 --> 00:04:33,685
它的发音应该是 pa-codge
It's pronounced pa-codge.

122
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:37,885
滚出去! 你, 我能帮你
Get out of here! You,I can work with.

123
00:04:37,981 --> 00:04:41,079
给我3天时间
You give me three days,and I will find

124
00:04:41,184 --> 00:04:43,006
我会找出你的伴侣
the woman you will marry.

125
00:04:43,112 --> 00:04:45,183
呃, 不用了谢了
Uh,no thanks.

126
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,025
我不需要一个算术系统
来帮我找女朋友
I don't need an algorithm to meet women.

127
00:04:47,101 --> 00:04:48,080
这里是纽约
It's new york city,

128
00:04:48,176 --> 00:04:50,487
你知道 大海里有很多鱼
you know-- plenty of fish in the sea.

129
00:04:50,602 --> 00:04:52,856
大海里有很多鱼
Plenty of fish in the sea.

130
00:04:52,971 --> 00:04:54,457
嗯, 纽约有九百万人口
Yes,there's nine million people in new york,

131
00:04:54,534 --> 00:04:57,085
四百五十万女人
4.5 million women.

132
00:04:57,191 --> 00:04:58,351
当然
Of course,you want to meet

133
00:04:58,476 --> 00:04:59,876
你想要的是跟你年龄差不多的
somebody roughly your own age.

134
00:04:59,991 --> 00:05:01,573
我们就假设, 加减五年内
Let's say,plus,minus,five years.

135
00:05:01,688 --> 00:05:04,009
所以根据我们最新的数据
So if we take into account the most recent census data,

136
00:05:04,182 --> 00:05:06,982
只剩下四十八万两千人合乎标准了
that leaves us with 482,000.

137
00:05:07,069 --> 00:05:09,620
但是, 呃, 等等...
But,uh,wait... 

138
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:10,924
其中48%已经有主了
48% of those are already in relationships,

139
00:05:10,934 --> 00:05:11,873
再排除掉一半
and then you have to eliminate half

140
00:05:11,998 --> 00:05:13,283
还要考虑智商, 幽默感
for intelligence,sense of humor

141
00:05:13,302 --> 00:05:15,403
和你知趣相投的
然后再去掉
and compatibility,and then you have to take out

142
00:05:15,422 --> 00:05:16,918
你的前女朋友和亲戚
the ex-girlfriends and the relatives,

143
00:05:17,062 --> 00:05:19,536
最后, 噢, 别忘了同性恋
and,oh,we can't forget those lesbians.

144
00:05:19,766 --> 00:05:24,389
剩下的只有八个啦
And then that leaves us with eight women.

145
00:05:25,722 --> 00:05:29,395
这不可能
八个? 真的吗? 就八个?
That can't be right. Eight? Really? Eight?

146
00:05:29,894 --> 00:05:33,260
八条鱼在这片大海洋里, Ted
There are eight fish in that big blue ocean,ted.

147
00:05:33,385 --> 00:05:35,571
如果你有绝对的自信可以不用我的帮助
And if you feel confident that you could reel one

148
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:39,273
钓一条上船, 门就在那边
in to your boat without me,there's the door.

149
00:05:39,369 --> 00:05:41,306
你这可以刷卡吗?
Do you take credit cards?

150
00:05:43,685 --> 00:05:45,018
好吧, 它又来了
Okay,it's back.

151
00:05:45,123 --> 00:05:46,965
我们这次看仔细了
And this time we got a good look.

152
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,612
嘿, 我认真的, 你得停止这样
Hey,seriously,you have to stop doing that.

153
00:05:49,698 --> 00:05:53,131
它长的更大了 它喂的很饱
It's bigger now. It's been feeding.

154
00:05:54,263 --> 00:05:56,728
我们在楼上看电视
We were just upstairs watching TV.

155
00:05:56,852 --> 00:05:58,585
噢, 天那
Oh,gosh.

156
00:06:04,758 --> 00:06:07,939
好吧,我们来干吧
okay,let's do this.

157
00:06:16,781 --> 00:06:18,095
shh,shh,shh（尖叫声）
shh,shh,shh.

158
00:06:18,191 --> 00:06:24,876
没事了 都过去了
噢, 天那!
It's okay. It's over. Oh,god!

159
00:06:31,081 --> 00:06:32,222
那么你们看清楚那东西啦?
So did you get a good look at it?

160
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,207
是啊 它有六只脚
Yeah. It has six legs,

161
00:06:34,313 --> 00:06:37,334
有坚硬的甲壳, 就象蟑螂
a hard exoskeleton,like a roach.

162
00:06:37,516 --> 00:06:39,520
但是它有老鼠的特点
But it had mouse-like characteristics.

163
00:06:39,741 --> 00:06:42,378
灰色的皮毛和尾巴
Grey-brown tufts of fur,a tail.

164
00:06:42,464 --> 00:06:45,140
那到底是什么, 蟑螂还是老鼠?
So which is it,a cockroach or a mouse?

165
00:06:46,981 --> 00:06:51,220
- 它只蟑螂鼠
- 什么?
-It's a cock-a-mouse.
-What?

166
00:06:51,422 --> 00:06:54,337
它是两种的综合变异体
It's some sort of mutant combination of the two.

167
00:06:54,433 --> 00:06:57,310
就象一只老鼠和蟑螂
It's as if a cockroach and a mouse,

168
00:06:57,406 --> 00:06:59,401
你们知道...
you know... 

169
00:06:59,641 --> 00:07:01,923
地面上有这种10条腿的混合物种吗?
did the horizontal,ten-legged,interspecies cha-cha?

170
00:07:02,106 --> 00:07:02,882
这不可能
That's impossible.

171
00:07:02,997 --> 00:07:04,311
不会发生这种事
That simply can't happen.

172
00:07:04,426 --> 00:07:06,406
-噢, 但是可以
-它确实发生了
Oh,but it can. And it has.

173
00:07:06,407 --> 00:07:07,553
而且很生气
And it's pissed.

174
00:07:10,027 --> 00:07:10,670
伙计, 没什么事吧?
Dude,is everything okay?

175
00:07:10,766 --> 00:07:11,408
你们的门没关
You left the front door open.

176
00:07:11,542 --> 00:07:13,585

There was no time.

177
00:07:15,427 --> 00:07:17,115
嗯, 恋爱配对中心?
So,love solutions?

178
00:07:17,278 --> 00:07:18,553
你碰到你的爱人了?

179
00:07:18,726 --> 00:07:20,020
她说只要三天

现在已经五天了

181
00:07:21,766 --> 00:07:22,543
我应该担心吗?
Should I be worried?

182
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,684
噢, 别当回事
Oh,just play it cool.

183
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,324
别太担心
Don't ted out about it.

184
00:07:26,072 --> 00:07:27,894
你刚刚把我的名字当动词用吗?
Did you just use my name as a verb?

185
00:07:28,182 --> 00:07:31,030
噢, 嗯
我们在你背后一直那样
Oh,yeah. We do that behind your back.

186
00:07:31,097 --> 00:07:32,852
"Ted out" 表示想太多
"Ted out," to overthink.

187
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,444
还有"Ted up"

列如: Billy 想太多不好的结果

191
00:07:39,422 --> 00:07:40,649
当他... 好了

192
00:07:40,755 --> 00:07:42,510
我知道了 别担心
I get it. Don't worry.

我不会担心太多
I'm not going to ted anything up. Or out.

194
00:07:45,761 --> 00:07:47,094
我得多给她点时间

195
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:50,259
嗨, Ellen 记得我吗?
Hi,ellen. Remember me?

196
00:07:50,364 --> 00:07:51,237
我是Ted

00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:54,018
Ted, 嗨
我, 呃, 本来想打电话给你

电脑仍然在处理数据
The computer is still crunching the numbers.

199
00:07:56,301 --> 00:07:58,037
象勤劳的蜜蜂, 可爱的小电脑

200
00:07:58,382 --> 00:07:59,821
你说只要三天
You said it was going to be three days.

202
00:08:02,688 --> 00:08:04,271

你将在三天内碰到你的完美女人
you're going to meet the perfect woman in three days,


204
00:08:05,546 --> 00:08:07,080
你会考虑把这加到约会表里
you kind of put that in your date book,

205
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:09,593
那么...
我该怎么说呢?

206
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,000
这事变的很艰难
This is going to be really hard.

207

Ted... 我找不到

208
00:08:15,088 --> 00:08:16,460
任何一个女人给你
no women out there for you.

209
00:08:17,457 --> 00:08:19,999
唷, 还好, 我熬过这一刻了
Phew,actually,I got through that okay.

210
00:08:23,523 --> 00:08:25,365
找不到一个女人给我？我以为会有八个适合我的
There are no women out there for me?
I thought you said there were eight.

211
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,736
我知道 理论上应该是

但我不知道她们哪去了
I don't know where they are.

213

但... 我是个设计师
But... I'm an architect.

214
00:08:29,536 --> 00:08:30,496
你也说我很讨人喜欢
And you said I'm cute.

215
00:08:30,591 --> 00:08:31,589
我是个讨人喜欢的设计师
I'm a cute architect.

216
00:08:31,646 --> 00:08:32,548
你觉得我怎么想?

我有100%的成功率
I have a 100% success rate.

218
00:08:35,243 --> 00:08:36,595
这是我的卖点
That's my hook.

219
00:08:36,624 --> 00:08:37,477
我也许能给你找到某人
I could maybe find somebody for you 

220
00:08:37,497 --> 00:08:38,878
如果你是同性恋

不! 你在和我开玩笑, 是不?
No! You're messing with me,right?

224
00:08:43,922 --> 00:08:45,178
你自己过来看看
Come see for yourself.

225
00:08:46,511 --> 00:08:47,998
我不能给你配对
I can not set you up

226
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:49,369
除非你融合度有7.0
unless you have a compatibility rating of 7.0 

227
00:08:49,456 --> 00:08:51,498
或者再高点

我六个月前已经给她找对象了

她应该更合适你
She would have been absolutely perfect for you.

233
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:06,460
嗯, 你给他找的那家伙怎么样?
Well,what about the guy you set her up with?

234
00:09:06,603 --> 00:09:08,176
他们的融合度是9.6吗?
Is he a 9.6 compatibility rating?

235
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,104
8.5
那他很烂
8.5. So he sucks.

236
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:13,537
不, 8.5已经是很不错的程度了
No,8.5 is an extremely good match-up quotient.

237
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:15,417
噢, 当然, 那很好
Oh,sure,it's good.

238
00:09:15,551 --> 00:09:20,231
- 很不错, 但是9.6?

-It's solid,but a 9.6? 
-9.6 is off the charts,

239
00:09:20,356 --> 00:09:22,140
但是Sarah已经有主了
but sarah is matched up.

240
00:09:22,341 --> 00:09:24,710
Ted, 听着, 我有午餐约会

土豆大小
And it's the size of a potato.

246
00:10:07,138 --> 00:10:10,667
那, 现在是只蟑螂土豆鼠?
So what,now it's a cock-a-potato-mouse?

247
00:10:10,754 --> 00:10:12,039
别让这听起来很滑稽
Don't make it sound ridiculous.

248
00:10:12,135 --> 00:10:13,794
这是蟑螂鼠
It's a cock-a-mouse.

249
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:15,836
我的天, 这太让人难以相信了
My god,this is incredible.

250
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,524
我们就是同一种人

你是她的完美女人
Wow,ted,sounds like you're her perfect woman.

256

就象宏伟的海象

257

而且是雌雄同体

258
00:10:32,543 --> 00:10:35,986
很明显整件事情仍是个迷
Obviously the whole thing is shrouded in mystery.

259
00:10:36,091 --> 00:10:38,173
目前为止我们所知道的关于蟑螂鼠
For as much as we know about the cock-a-mouse,

我们不知道的是

你们有没抽大麻

So you really don't believe in the cock-a-mouse?

只是很平常的东西
something perfectly normal,

268
00:10:52,731 --> 00:10:55,397
但是在你们脑海里夸大了, 知道吗?
but you've exaggerated it in your mind,you know?

269
00:10:55,512 --> 00:10:57,900
就象尼斯湖水怪
Like the loch ness monster.

270
00:10:59,847 --> 00:11:01,851
如果你说象尼斯湖水怪
If by "like the loch ness monster,"

271
00:11:01,947 --> 00:11:03,482
是指真正出现过而且让人震惊的话
you mean totally exists and is a wesome,

272
00:11:03,568 --> 00:11:06,675
那么我同意, 这就象尼斯湖水怪
then yeah,it's like the loch ness monster.

273
00:11:07,836 --> 00:11:09,715
它的食物不象我们吃的谷类
Its diet is not unlike our own-- grains,

274
00:11:09,917 --> 00:11:11,902
它很喜欢奶酪
cereals-- and it's awfully fond of cheese.

275
00:11:11,988 --> 00:11:13,312
嗯, 这很奇怪
Okay,this is getting weird.

276
00:11:13,398 --> 00:11:14,846
我们的相同点越来越多
The similarities go on and on.

277
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:17,378
她讨厌煲电话粥
我也一样
She hates phonies. I totally hate phonies,too.

278
00:11:17,474 --> 00:11:21,205
她是皮肤病专家
我有皮肤
she's a dermatologist. I have skin.

279
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,557
你想当她男朋友
You want to be her boyfriend.

280
00:11:22,787 --> 00:11:24,015
她已经有男朋友了
She already has a boy friend,

281
00:11:24,024 --> 00:11:26,988
- 这太凑巧了
- 是啊
-it's uncanny.
- All right.

282
00:11:27,151 --> 00:11:28,263
但是我去看看她没什么大碍, 不是吗?
But it wouldn't hurt to check her out,right?

283
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:30,431
面对面看看我的9.6长什么样?
See what my 9.6 looks like in person?

284
00:11:30,527 --> 00:11:32,128
你知道, 做为一个参考
As,you know,a frame of reference.

285
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:34,842
如果她觉得多11.45%更好
And if she thinks she can do 11.45% better,

286
00:11:34,957 --> 00:11:36,578
我怎么会拒绝呢?
who am i to deny her that?

287
00:11:36,674 --> 00:11:37,470
对啊
That's right.

288
00:11:37,595 --> 00:11:39,206
我用了数学加法
I did the math.

289
00:11:42,505 --> 00:11:45,085
- 嗨
- 嗨 我是O'brien医生
-Hi.
-Hi. I'm dr. O'brien.

290
00:11:45,257 --> 00:11:46,466
我是Mosby设计师
I'm architect mosby.

291
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:49,132
抱歉, 我只是也想说出我的职业
Sorry,I just wanted to say my job,too.

292
00:11:49,717 --> 00:11:52,134
- 嗨, 我是Ted
- 嗨 你哪里不有问题?
-Hi,I'm ted. 
-Hi. So what are we doing today?

293
00:11:52,134 --> 00:11:54,790
对, 我, 呃, 我背后长了些痔
Right,I,uh,I have a kind of mole on my back.

294
00:11:54,992 --> 00:11:56,775
可能没什么大不了的, 但我是个谨慎的人
It's probably nothing,but I'm a cautious guy.

295
00:11:56,871 --> 00:11:58,626
我也是这种
I'm exactly the same.

296
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:07,469
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Summer breeze makes me feel fine both:

297
00:12:07,497 --> 00:12:12,734
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind:

298
00:12:14,671 --> 00:12:15,860
抱歉
Sorry about that.

299
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,855
夏日微风是我最喜欢的歌
"Summer breeze" is my guilty pleasure song.

300
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:19,591
它一直在我脑中回响着
It's been stuck in my head ever since

301
00:12:19,735 --> 00:12:22,535
自从这周... 早午餐的时候听到后
I heard it this weekend... at brunch.

302
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:25,767
- 我喜欢早午餐
- 那是最好的
-I love brunch.
-It's the best.

303
00:12:26,017 --> 00:12:27,004
只要我不用
As long as I don't have to

304
00:12:27,119 --> 00:12:28,999
边吃边讲电话
spend it with a bunch of phonies.

305
00:12:29,718 --> 00:12:32,461
我喜欢你思考的方式, Mosby设计师
I like the way you think,architect mosby.

306
00:12:34,015 --> 00:12:34,821
嘿, 这可能听起来有点奇怪
Hey,this may sound weird,

307
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:35,799
但有一次我的衬衫掉了
but it'll definitely sound more

308
00:12:35,962 --> 00:12:36,902
听起来更奇怪
weird once my shirt's off.

309
00:12:37,026 --> 00:12:38,561
我现在要问一句
So I'm going to ask you now.

310
00:12:38,676 --> 00:12:41,256
你周六晚愿意和我共进晚餐吗?
Do you want to have dinner with me saturday night?

311
00:12:41,754 --> 00:12:43,270
这很不错
That's very sweet,

312
00:12:43,356 --> 00:12:47,144
但我周六要结婚了
but I'm actually getting married on saturday.

313
00:12:47,796 --> 00:12:49,168
周五晚呢?
Friday night?

314
00:12:51,444 --> 00:12:53,295
哇 你要结婚啦
wow. You're getting married.

315
00:12:53,429 --> 00:12:55,251
- 恭喜
- 谢谢
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

316
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:56,584
很抱歉我邀你出去
I'm really sorry I asked you out,

317
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,195
象我们间
it just felt like there could be

318
00:12:58,301 --> 00:12:59,490
有些奇怪的关联
this weird connection between us.

319
00:12:59,624 --> 00:13:01,082
我这样来这里是不是太疯狂了?
How crazy am I coming off here?

320
00:13:01,207 --> 00:13:02,597
只有一点
Only a little.

321
00:13:02,751 --> 00:13:05,101
嗯... 如果有百万分之一的机会
Well... if by some million- to-one long shot

322
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:08,045
你改变主意不结婚了
and I'm not rooting for this-- you wind up not getting married this weekend,

323
00:13:08,169 --> 00:13:11,421
给我打个电话
give me a call.

324
00:13:11,488 --> 00:13:13,550
好的 但是不会那样的
Okay. But it's not likely.

325
00:13:13,655 --> 00:13:15,966
我穿上礼服太棒了
I look damn good in my dress.

326
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,558
我同意
I'm sure you do.

327
00:13:21,347 --> 00:13:24,272
哇, 这真是高难度的陷阱
Wow,that's a pretty sophisticated trap.

328
00:13:24,406 --> 00:13:26,641
你们认为走鹃会进去吗?
You think the roadrunner's going to fall for it?

329
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:28,424
好了, 我们知道了
你是怀疑论者
Okay,we get it.You're skeptical.

330
00:13:28,597 --> 00:13:30,736
但Marshall和我, 我们相信
But marshall and I,we're believers.

331
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,414
-我们相信
-对, 看看周围
We believe. Yeah,look around.

332
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:34,869
宇宙充满着迷团和未知的东西
The universe is mysterious and awesome.

333
00:13:34,965 --> 00:13:37,957
有百慕达三角, 鬼神, 北美野人
You've got the bermuda triangle,ghosts,bigfoot.

334

还有烂地图, 破损的房屋
Bad maps,creaky houses,

335
00:13:39,731 --> 00:13:41,391
穿的象猩猩的乡下人

336
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:45,447
外星人 噢, 拜托
你得承认外星人
Aliens. Oh,come on,you've got to give me aliens.

Stonehenge,area 51,

338
00:13:47,097 --> 00:13:49,120
到处都有外星人的足迹
there's alien crap all over the place.

339
00:13:49,821 --> 00:13:51,336
你不是认真的吧
You can't be serious.

340
00:13:51,518 --> 00:13:53,877
朋友, 你惹到狗熊了
（麻烦大了）
My friend,you just poked the bear.

341
00:13:55,786 --> 00:13:58,855
我的9.6适合的人 漂亮
So my 9.6-- beautiful,

342
00:13:58,874 --> 00:14:01,655
迷人, 智慧, 而且订婚了
charming,intelligent,engaged.

343
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,861
噢, Ted
我为你感到难过
Oh,ted. I'm so sorry.

344
00:14:03,928 --> 00:14:05,347
嗯, 这不太可能
Yeah,it was a long shot.

345
00:14:05,367 --> 00:14:06,191
我告诉她如果改变心意
I told her to call me anyway

346
00:14:06,211 --> 00:14:07,352
就给我打电话
if she changes mind.

347
00:14:07,371 --> 00:14:08,138
我也不知道
but I don't know.

348
00:14:08,234 --> 00:14:11,399
哇, 哇, 哇
我们别想这个了
Whoa,whoa,whoa. Let's not skip over this.

如果今天你有向
订婚了的女人表达感情
Raise your hand if earlier today

350
00:14:12,962 --> 00:14:15,034

380
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:14,890
但我要给自己一次机会

388
00:15:32,153 --> 00:15:33,841
冷静 我有个计划

他们会在它身上做实验
They'll do lab experiments on it.

394
00:15:42,588 --> 00:15:43,815
这太狠心了
That's so mean.

395
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:47,421
我们不能直接用棍子打死它吗?
Shouldn't we just beat it to death with a bat?

396
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:52,801

活组织检查报告出来了
The biopsy came back.

404
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,248
并不威胁生命
It's not life-threatening,

405
00:16:13,382 --> 00:16:15,396
但我们还的检查其他的
but we should excise the rest of it.

406
00:16:15,521 --> 00:16:17,573
等等, 你还是要结婚吗?
Wait,then you're still getting married?

407
00:16:17,688 --> 00:16:19,165
当然我要结婚
Of course I'm still getting married.

408
00:16:19,242 --> 00:16:21,103
但是我们适合度是9.6
But we're a 9.6.

409
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,702
- 什么?
- 好吧
-Excuse me? 
-Okay.

410
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,322
我去了恋爱配对中心
I went to love solutions,

411
00:16:25,476 --> 00:16:27,346
我看了Ellen Pierce的电脑
and I saw on ellen pierce's computer,

412
00:16:27,365 --> 00:16:28,650
我们两个适合度是9.6
that you and I are a 9.6.

413
00:16:28,852 --> 00:16:30,827
你的未婚夫只有8.5
Your fiancé is only an 8.5.

414
00:16:30,837 --> 00:16:32,189
你看了我的档案?
You looked at my file?

415
00:16:32,295 --> 00:16:34,702
我必须看
你是唯一和我匹配的
I had to. You're my only match.

416
00:16:34,807 --> 00:16:35,929
你一点也不好奇吗?
Aren't you even a little curious?

417
00:16:36,016 --> 00:16:37,425
把你和你未婚夫拉到一起的那个女人
The woman who set you up with your fiancé,

418
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:38,653
认为我们两个更适合
thinks we're a better match.

419
00:16:38,768 --> 00:16:42,230
我周六就结婚了
I am getting married on saturday.

420
00:16:43,784 --> 00:16:46,853
- Summer breeze...（歌词）
- Ted
-Summer breeze...
-ted.

421
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:47,908
听着, 你不觉得
Look,don't you think

422
00:16:47,927 --> 00:16:49,365
你不觉得就结婚有点冲动吗
you're being a little impulsive marrying

423
00:16:49,586 --> 00:16:50,689
和一个才认识几个月的家伙?
a guy you just met a few months ago?

424
00:16:50,756 --> 00:16:52,367
你不觉得向一个你刚认识的
Don't you think it's a little impulsive for you

425
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:54,180
已经订婚了的女人
to proposition an engaged woman

426
00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:55,686
求爱有点冲动吗?
you don't even know?

427
00:16:55,705 --> 00:16:57,786
看? 我们都很冲动
See? We're both impulsive.

428
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:58,965
我们很适合对方
We're perfect for each other.

429
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,318
Ted, 冷静下来
Ted,just calm down.

430
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:02,504
冷静?! 你是唯一和我适合的
Calm down?! You're my only match.

431
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:03,770
天, 那里有台电脑
God,there was a computer

432
00:17:03,914 --> 00:17:06,245
八条鱼在大海里
and there were eight fish in a sea

433
00:17:06,379 --> 00:17:07,424
充满着同性恋...
full of lesbians and...

434
00:17:07,511 --> 00:17:08,585
好了, Ted, Ted
okay,ted,ted.

435
00:17:09,889 --> 00:17:11,855
你真的认为, 相信
Do you honestly believe,deep down,

436
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,917
没有人适合你了吗
that there is no one else out there for you

437
00:17:14,137 --> 00:17:16,593
只是因为一台电脑这样说?
just because some computer says so?

438
00:17:18,415 --> 00:17:20,036
我以前不是
I didn't used to.

439
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:23,325
但是有数学计算, 我很迷惑
But there was math,I got confused.

440
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,994
爱情不是科学
Love isn't a science.

441
00:17:25,138 --> 00:17:27,660
你不能计算感情
You can't calculate a feeling.

442
00:17:27,823 --> 00:17:29,453
当你真正爱上某人
When you fall in love with someone,

443
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:32,589
8.5分就相当于完美的10分
an 8.5 equals a perfect ten.

444
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,025
你是对的
You're right.

445
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:37,615
如果这象你说的那样
If this thing is what you say it is,

446
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:39,619
这将是我职业生涯的巨大转折点
it could be huge for my career.

447
00:17:39,869 --> 00:17:41,508
打起精神, 伙计
Brace yourself,dude.

448
00:17:41,604 --> 00:17:44,107
这将让你大开眼界
This is going to blow your mind hole.

449
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:50,034
混蛋，你怎么装得这么兴奋
You bastard. I actually got excited about this.

450
00:17:50,159 --> 00:17:52,192
- 什么?
- 这是空的
-What?
-It's empty.

451
00:17:54,225 --> 00:17:59,260
等下, 如果它不在这
表示... Lily
Wait,but if it's not here,that means... lily.

452
00:18:00,565 --> 00:18:01,955
- Robin!
- 怎么了?
-Robin!
-What?

453
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,489
噢, 天那 是真的
oh,god. It's real.

454
00:18:07,604 --> 00:18:10,184
不, 不是吗? 做点什么
No,is it? Do something.

455
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,552
你在干什么?
what the hell was that?

456
00:18:16,676 --> 00:18:17,530
你想灌醉它吗?
You trying to get it drunk?

457
00:18:17,645 --> 00:18:19,928
这是我唯一能想到的
It was the only thing I could think of.

458
00:18:20,254 --> 00:18:21,510
Lily! 感谢老天
Lily! Thank god.

459
00:18:25,346 --> 00:18:27,552
Lily, 我爱你
lily,I love you.

460
00:18:27,677 --> 00:18:29,259
Robin, 把窗户打开!
Robin,open up the window!

461
00:18:33,354 --> 00:18:34,275
开窗!
open the window!

462
00:18:35,646 --> 00:18:39,329
啊! 它还能飞
Ah!it can fly.

463
00:18:40,394 --> 00:18:45,007
哇 哇 哇 自由了, 变异怪物
Wow. Wow. Wow. Be free,mutant beast.

464
00:18:45,141 --> 00:18:47,212
我会怀念我们间的战斗
I'll miss this private war of ours.

465
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:49,082
我佩服你的顽强...
I grew to admire your tenacious...

466
00:18:49,303 --> 00:18:50,099
老天
holy mother of god,

467
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:51,518
它往这边飞来了!
it's headed this way!

468
00:19:00,303 --> 00:19:01,550
嗨, Ellen
hi,ellen.

469
00:19:03,641 --> 00:19:05,396
我想要回我的钱
I think I want my money back.

470
00:19:06,786 --> 00:19:09,184
我真失败 我全搞砸了
I'm a failure. I'm all washed up.

471
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,920
我什么都试过了, Ted
I tried everything,ted.

472
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,972
我扩大了搜寻参数
I widened the search parameters.

473
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,622
在系统中搜索
I tweaked the program.

474
00:19:14,929 --> 00:19:17,432
昨晚我站在大街上
Last night I stood out on the street

475
00:19:17,576 --> 00:19:19,455
5个小时拿着你的照片
for five hours showing your photo

476
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:20,683
希望能在行人中找到合适的人
to random pedestrians.

477
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:22,198
没人愿意
No takers.

478
00:19:22,524 --> 00:19:23,915
尽管那些易装妓女说
Although this transvestite hooker said

479
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:25,718
他/她愿意半价让你上
he/she would do you for half price

480
00:19:25,814 --> 00:19:27,118
因为你长的象John Cusack
because you kind of look like john cusack

481
00:19:27,271 --> 00:19:29,803
他/她最喜欢的电影明星
and his/her favorite movie was say anything.

482
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:32,748
别这样, Ellen
Come on,ellen.

483
00:19:32,853 --> 00:19:33,380
我说, 一盒冰淇淋
I mean,a pint of ice cream,

484
00:19:33,524 --> 00:19:34,857
是不是太老套了?
isn't that a bit cliché?

485
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,526
这是用来装波旁的（一种威士忌酒）
It's for the bourbon.

486
00:19:37,754 --> 00:19:38,713
别绝望
This isn't hopeless.

487
00:19:38,828 --> 00:19:40,036
你会给我找到合适的人的
You're going to find someone for me.

488
00:19:40,142 --> 00:19:41,897
不, 我找不到
No,I won'T.

489
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,096
你会孤独至死
You're going to die alone.

490
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:46,232
我不会孤独到死
I'm not going to die alone.

491
00:19:46,366 --> 00:19:46,884
看看我
Look at me.

492
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:48,332
我聪明, 我有吸引力
I'm bright,I'm attractive.

493
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,464
你只要振作起来
You just got to get back out there

494
00:19:49,636 --> 00:19:50,240
继续寻找
and keep looking.

495
00:19:50,327 --> 00:19:51,880
不, 你永远找不到任何人适合你
No,you're never going to find anybody.

496
00:19:51,976 --> 00:19:53,616
每过一年你就老一岁
And every year you're just getting older

497
00:19:53,703 --> 00:19:54,757
这就会变的更加困难
and it's getting harder and harder.

498
00:19:54,863 --> 00:19:56,580
这太可笑了
You're being ridiculous.

499
00:19:56,685 --> 00:19:58,162
不多久我将会出现在这面墙上
I'm going to be up on that wall one of these days.

500
00:19:58,287 --> 00:20:00,809
- 不, 你不会!
- 不, 我会!
-No,you won't!
-Yes,I will!

501
00:20:00,953 --> 00:20:02,123
你怎么知道?
How do you know?

502
00:20:02,238 --> 00:20:04,799
我不清楚, 但是我相信
I don't know,but I believe.

503
00:20:05,058 --> 00:20:06,515
如果一只蟑螂和老鼠
Hell,if a cockroach and a mouse

504
00:20:06,621 --> 00:20:07,906
能在这城市找到真爱
can find love in this crazy city,

505
00:20:08,031 --> 00:20:09,527
那么, 他妈的, 我也能
then,damn it,so can I.

506
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:11,857
你让我迷惑了
You're losing me.

507
00:20:11,953 --> 00:20:13,229
重点是
The point is,

508
00:20:13,353 --> 00:20:14,638
一些好事会发生在我身上
something good's going to happen to me.

509
00:20:14,734 --> 00:20:16,269
也许你的电脑帮的上忙
Maybe your computer will help,

510
00:20:16,393 --> 00:20:18,724
也许不能, 但不管怎样它还是会发生
maybe it won't,but it'll happen.

511
00:20:20,431 --> 00:20:22,167
那我该继续寻找吗?
So I should keep looking?

512
00:20:22,292 --> 00:20:24,085
你当然要
Of course you should.

513
00:20:24,277 --> 00:20:28,036
而且现在, 你会免费为我寻找
And now,you're going to do it for free.

514
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:30,731
