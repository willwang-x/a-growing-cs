00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:15,392
就在我遇到你们母亲的前一晚
So there was this one night before I met your mother,

5
00:00:15,536 --> 00:00:17,435
那天我特别特别想去酒吧
when I really wanted to go to the bar.

6
00:00:17,531 --> 00:00:19,851
酒吧……意料之中
The bar... big surprise.

7
00:00:19,995 --> 00:00:21,645
你们的确是花很多时间泡酒吧
You sure spent a lot of time in bars.

8
00:00:22,086 --> 00:00:23,908
呵呵，我们当时就这点休闲
Well,that's just we did back then.

9
00:00:24,081 --> 00:00:26,085
我，Marshal和Lily
Me,uncle marshall and aunt lily,

10
00:00:26,392 --> 00:00:28,090
Barney，Robin
barney,robin--

11
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:31,657
我们经常去的酒吧叫作Mcclaren's
we all used to hang out at this one bar called mcclaren'S.

12
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:32,846
但是，一天晚上……
But then,one night...

13
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,160
我们去Mcclaren's怎么样？
why don't we go to mcclaren's?

14
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,445
我们去Mcclaren's吧
Let's go to mcclaren'S.

15
00:00:35,589 --> 00:00:37,411
你们俩在跟彼此打电话？
You guys talking to each other?

16
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,550
没人听我说话？
Nobody's listening?

17
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:42,667
-Mcclaren's不好吗-Mcclaren's沉闷极了
What's wrong with mcclaren's? Mcclaren's is bore-snore.

18
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:45,889
Ted，今晚我们出去玩,我们要去钓女生
Ted,tonight we're going to go out. We're going to meet some ladies.

19
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,361
这肯定是传奇性的！手机击掌
It's going to be legendary. Phone five.

20
00:00:49,697 --> 00:00:52,555
我搞不清为什么和Barney是朋友
I had no idea why I hung out with barney.

21
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,000

22
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:58,050
你没有手机击掌，对不对？我知道你没有手机击掌Ted,You didn't phone five,did you? I know when you don't phone five,ted.

23
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,730

24
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,850
来吧，我们总是去Mcclaren's
Come on. We always to go to mcclaren'S.

25
00:01:00,975 --> 00:01:02,673
是啊，因为Mcclaren's有趣
Yeah,'cause Mcclaren's is fun.

26
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:04,984
Mcclaren's只是这么有趣
Mcclaren's is this much fun.

27
00:01:05,156 --> 00:01:08,887
我提议的可是……这么有趣的
What I'm offering is the chance to have... this much fun.

28
00:01:09,213 --> 00:01:11,563
瞧，你又这么说。每次你都说会这么有趣
See,you say that. You say it's going to be this much fun,

29
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,402
结果大多数时候都只有这么有趣
but most of the time it ends up being this much fun.

30
00:01:14,718 --> 00:01:17,921
这么有趣够了，这样安全，有保障
This much fun is good. It's safe. It's guaranteed.

31
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,791
我们打电话的时候，这些手势其实没什么用，对不？
This hand gesture thing doesn't really work on the phone,does it?

32
00:01:20,031 --> 00:01:21,633
是啊，没有用
No,it doesn't.

33
00:01:22,112 --> 00:01:24,088
上计程车。Marshall，你也一样
get in the cab. Marshall,you,too.

34
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:26,716
-哦，我也很想，但是Lily正要和我……-我理解
--Oh,I wish I could. I think lily and i are just going to...--I understand.

35
00:01:27,071 --> 00:01:27,588
Ted，上计程车
Ted,get in the cab.

36
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:28,941
为什么Marshall可以拒绝？
Why can marshall say no?

37
00:01:29,142 --> 00:01:31,156
嗯，因为他有上床的对象了
Uh,because he's getti laid.

38
00:01:31,684 --> 00:01:32,786
常任的
Consistently.

39
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:32,940

40
00:01:33,678 --> 00:01:35,002
Ted，Ted，Ted……看这儿
Ted,ted,ted... right here.

41
00:01:35,692 --> 00:01:38,090
你每次都去同一间酒吧,你墨守成规了
You keep going to the same bar. You're in a rut.

42
00:01:38,339 --> 00:01:41,408
而我则是一个成规破坏者,我要破坏你的成规
And I am a rut-buster. I'm going to bust your rut.

43
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,480

44
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:45,024
这不是成规，好不好？这是常规，我喜欢常规
It's not a rut,ok? It's a routine,and I like it.

45
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:48,419
Ted，常规和成规就差第一个字
Ted,what's the first syllable in "rut-tine"?

46
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,250

47
00:01:56,667 --> 00:01:58,527
沉闷去吧，输家们
Peace out,suckers.

48
00:02:00,637 --> 00:02:03,581
-好吧，你的传奇性的计划是怎么样的？-首先我们去机场接某个人
All right,so what's this legendary plan? First we've got to pick someone up at the airport.

49
00:02:03,984 --> 00:02:06,669
-好了，我要下车-Estaban，关门
--Okay,I'm out of here. --Estaban,doors.

50
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,060

51
00:02:10,141 --> 00:02:13,133
好的，我们先完成这件小事,接下来整个晚上都是我们的
okay,we just do this one little thing,and the rest of the night is ours.

52
00:02:13,776 --> 00:02:15,857
你怎么提着两口箱子？我们要接谁？
Why do you have those suitcases,and who are we picking up?

53
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:19,549
我不知道，也许她，或者是她
I don't know. Maybe her. Or her.

54
00:02:20,086 --> 00:02:23,347
等等，你刚才说“去机场接某个人”
wait,so when you said you were going to pick someone up at the airport,

55
00:02:23,433 --> 00:02:27,135
就真的是在机场接“某个人”？
you meant you were going to "pick someone up" at the airport?

56
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,670

57
00:02:27,883 --> 00:02:32,007
情景假设：一群小妞飞抵纽约城想要享受一段浪漫之旅
Scenario: A couple of girls fly into town looking for a fun weekend in nyc,

58
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,620

59
00:02:32,122 --> 00:02:34,999
在那儿她们遇见了两个潇洒的国际商人
when they meet two handsome international businessmen

60
00:02:35,153 --> 00:02:37,867
刚刚从日本盈利归来
just back from a lucrative trip to japan.

61
00:02:38,404 --> 00:02:42,384
示范对话：“你的旅行箱有轮子？真巧，我的也有”
Sample dialogue: "You have a wheelie bag? Well,I have a eelie bag."

62
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,369
-你在跟我开玩笑-错
--You've got to be kidding me. 
--False.

63
00:02:44,743 --> 00:02:47,054
补充提示，把你的衬衫塞进去,你这样看起来不修边幅
Sidebar... tuck in your shirt. You look sketchy.

64
00:02:47,457 --> 00:02:48,656
不修边幅？
I'm sketchy?

65
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,536
相信我，这肯定是传奇性的
Trust me,it's going to be legendary.

66
00:02:51,015 --> 00:02:54,593
别说“传奇性的”，好不好？你太滥用“传奇性的”这个词了
Don't say "legendary," okay? You're too liberal with the word "legendary."

67
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,501
我们要在中央公园修一个爱斯基摩冰屋
We're building an igloo in central park.

68
00:02:56,731 --> 00:02:59,378
这将会是传奇性的！穿上羽绒服！
It's going to be legendary. Snowsuit up!

69
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,250

70

Ted，Ted……看这儿！
Ted,ted,ted... right here.

71
00:03:04,145 --> 00:03:06,264
已经来这儿了，现在你要不就是去把旅行箱放上行李传送带
This is happening. Now you can either put the bags on the carousel now,

72
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:08,662
要不就是听我长篇大论一番
or you can listen to me give you a really long speech 

73
00:03:08,738 --> 00:03:11,587
说服你放上去,你自己决定
convincing you to put the bags on the carousel.Your move.

74
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,420

75
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,957
Ted，自从亘古以来，人类努力要……
Ted,since the dawn of time-- mankind has struggled...

76
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,970

77
00:03:18,741 --> 00:03:20,937
那天晚上，Marshall埋头于学习当中
that night,marshall had a ton of studying to do.

78
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,735
于是Lily和Robin一起出去Robin刚来纽约，想找个朋友
So lily went out with robin..who was new to new york and looking for a friend.

79
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:28,063
我真高兴我们可以一起玩儿了,就我们两个
I'm so glad we finally get to hang out,just the two of us.

80
00:03:28,658 --> 00:03:30,403
你真的愿意周五晚上……
Yeah. You sure you're okay giving up your friday night

81
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,714
和一个快嫁人的老姑娘玩儿吗？
to hang with an old,almost married lady?

82
00:03:32,901 --> 00:03:35,175
哦，得了吧,我早就腻味找异性伙伴了
Oh, please.
I'm so sick of the meat-market scene.

83
00:03:35,227 --> 00:03:38,708
男人就像地铁,你错过了一趟，下一趟5分钟后到
Guys are like the subway. You miss one,another one comes along in five minutes.

84
00:03:39,082 --> 00:03:42,727
除非要是快午夜了,你就随便什么都上了
Unless it's the end of the night and then you get on anything. Hey-oh!

85
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,000

86
00:03:44,635 --> 00:03:46,237
那位先生送的
Compliments of that guy.

87
00:03:48,308 --> 00:03:50,274
真的？好极了
Really? Sweet.

88
00:03:50,533 --> 00:03:52,356
哦，你这杯要6美元
Oh,for you it's $6.

89
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,477
哦，这就是订婚后的缺点,他应该就是因为这个才……
Oh,yes,that's one drawback to being engaged. I'm sure that's why he didn'T...

90
00:03:57,544 --> 00:04:00,910
-嘿-哦，你好
--hey.  
--Oh,hello.

91
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,480

92
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,820

93
00:04:05,255 --> 00:04:07,806
那么，嗯……你刚从底特律来的？
So,uh... did you just get in from detroit?

94
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:11,400

95
00:04:10,203 --> 00:04:12,198
日本

96
00:04:16,111 --> 00:04:19,698
好的，4号传送带要开始了，准备好了吗？因为我要给你上上课
Okay,carousel 4 is tapped out. Ready? Because I'm about to drop some knowledge.

97
00:04:20,043 --> 00:04:22,872
靓妹不会来自布法罗！
Cute girls are not from buffalo.

98
00:04:23,668 --> 00:04:25,538
上完了，十点方向
Time-out,10:00.

99
00:04:26,219 --> 00:04:27,121
准备上场，Tedder
You ready to rock this,tedder?

100
00:04:27,408 --> 00:04:29,835
好吧，我们应该重编个故事,我们怎么会……？
All right,I think we need to refine our back story first. How did we...?

101
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:33,057
Ted，你这个笨拙的家伙
Ted,you klutzy great guy you.

102
00:04:34,544 --> 00:04:36,366
嘿，我是Barney

00:04:36,452 --> 00:04:38,888
-嗨，你还好吗？-我很抱歉
--Hi. My god,are you okay?  
--I am so sorry.

104
00:04:39,051 --> 00:04:43,319
没关系，不过你的落地有些不稳,我给你打9.2分
It's fine. No,you were shaky on your landing. I give you a 9.2. Ooh.

105
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:44,920

Look,I'm really sorry that we have to hit and run,but we've got a plane to catch.

108
00:04:48,642 --> 00:04:50,224
-你们要去哪儿？-费城
--Where you headed?

112
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,610
跟上她们，我去买机票
Follow them. Ticket's on me.

113
00:05:00,764 --> 00:05:04,178
不，Barney！你敢走上那个自动扶梯！
No. Barney! Don't you get on that escalator!

114
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,810

115
00:05:04,801 --> 00:05:07,899
你敢走上接下来的自动扶梯！
And don't you dare get on that subsequent escalator!

116
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,540

135
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:04,100

136
00:06:04,924 --> 00:06:08,328
这么的有趣,35000英尺高的有趣
This much fu... 35,000 feet of fun.

137
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,550

138
00:06:08,462 --> 00:06:09,508
好吧，我今天早上睡醒的时候……
Well,I didn't think I'd be flying to philadehia

139
00:06:09,527 --> 00:06:11,148
可想不到会今天飞到费城去,我只能这么说
when I woke up this morning,I'll give you that.

140
00:06:11,646 --> 00:06:13,593
好样的,我们去和那些小妞聊聊
Attaboy. Let's go talk to those girls.

141
00:06:13,862 --> 00:06:15,492
喔，喔，安全带指示灯亮着呢
Whoa,whoa,the seat belt sign's on.

142
00:06:15,713 --> 00:06:21,879
Ted，你这一生都坐在安全带里,是时候解开了
Ted,you've been living your whole life in a seat belt. It's time to unclick.

143
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,260

144
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,288
-先生，安全带指示灯亮着呢-对不起，对不起
--Sir,the seat belt light's on. 
--Sorry,sorry,sorry.

145
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,200

146
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,750

147
00:06:29,705 --> 00:06:31,019
我在帕克坡公园那边长大的
Well,I ew up in park slope.

148
00:06:31,105 --> 00:06:33,656
哦，我喜欢帕克坡公园,那你什么时候搬到曼哈顿的？
I love park slope. When did you move to manhattan?

149
00:06:33,762 --> 00:06:34,721
你来自帕克坡公园？
You're from park slope?

150
00:06:35,124 --> 00:06:36,773
嗯，不，是她
Uh,no,she is.

151
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:39,392
那你从哪儿来？天堂？
So where are you from? Heaven?

152
00:06:39,718 --> 00:06:44,091
是啊，我是个鬼魂，我是十五年前就死了,就像你刚才的搭讪辞一样
Yeah,I'm a ghost. I died 15 years ago,like that pickup line.

153
00:06:46,191 --> 00:06:47,045
老天，我很抱歉
God,I'm so sorry.

154
00:06:47,217 --> 00:06:48,148
哦，相信我，我也有过这种经验
Oh,believe me,I've been there.

155
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,926
我也有对付男人搭讪的台词……听我的
I have this line that I use when guys come... check it out.

156
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,780

157
00:06:52,674 --> 00:06:57,402
嘿……这个你解决吧,我对付下一个
Hey... you take this one. I'll save it for the next one.

158
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,650

159
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:01,550

160
00:07:00,423 --> 00:07:01,766
你们为什么要去费城？
so what brings you guys to philly?

161
00:07:01,862 --> 00:07:03,080
我们要去见我们的男朋友
We're visiting our boyfriends.

162
00:07:03,176 --> 00:07:05,698
我想她那位这周末就要求婚了
I think hers is going to propose this weekend.

163
00:07:06,302 --> 00:07:07,827
很好不是吗？
Isn't that great?

164
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,720

165
00:07:08,997 --> 00:07:10,848
太好了
So great.

166
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,430

167
00:07:15,637 --> 00:07:16,663
当时我们的情况是
So there we were:

168
00:07:16,788 --> 00:07:20,231
困在去费城的航班上,身边是两个非单身的美眉
Stuck on an airplane to philadelphia with two very un-single girls,

169
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,980

170
00:07:20,403 --> 00:07:22,264
这得多谢你们的Barney叔叔
all thanks to your uncle barney.

171
00:07:22,523 --> 00:07:25,486
他们是不是很帅？他们都是费城鹰队的后卫
Aren't they cute? They're both linebackers for the eagles.

172
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:30,924
两个都是？她们的男朋友都是橄榄球队后卫！
both? Both of their boyfriends are linebackers

173
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,450

174
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,655
你要去费城？为什么？
You're going to philly? Why?

175
00:07:35,911 --> 00:07:37,657
我没问
I didn't ask.

176
00:07:38,184 --> 00:07:40,668
听起来你的乐趣比我多多了
Well,it's sounds like you're having a lot more fun than I am.

177
00:07:41,042 --> 00:07:44,168
我只能看着男人们的后背,当他们搭讪Robin时候
I'm just talking to guy's backs while they hit on robin.

178
00:07:44,581 --> 00:07:46,135
是啊，我相信搭讪她的人不少
Yeah,I bet she gets that a lot.

179
00:07:46,806 --> 00:07:48,455
你不相信搭讪我的人很多？
Don't you bet I get that a lot?

180
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:49,827
只要你戴着戒指就不会啊
Not with a ring on your finger.

181
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:54,229
我是说，男的看见你的戒指就好像,注意，Marshall专用停车位
I mean,you know,guys see the ring,it's like ka-chong,marshall parking only.

182
00:07:54,296 --> 00:07:58,180
哦，原来如此，是戒指的原因,我才我还没习惯它
Oh,of course. That's it,the ring. I guess I'm not used to it yet.

183
00:07:58,305 --> 00:07:59,388
哦，就是戒指的原因
Oh,it's totally the ring.

184
00:07:59,494 --> 00:08:03,167
如果你把戒指取掉,男人们会像潮水般包围你
If you took that ring off your finger,you'd have a ton of guys crowding your junk.

185
00:08:03,647 --> 00:08:04,893
我要取掉我的戒指
I'm not gonna take off my ring.

186
00:08:05,498 --> 00:08:08,940
你就不嫉妒别的蜜蜂包围你的鲜花？
Wouldn't you be jealous of guys swarming all over my beeswax?

187
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,220
哦，是啊，你了解我的,我是个醋坛子
Oh,yeah,you know me-- I'm the jealous type.

188
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:13,620

189
00:08:12,412 --> 00:08:15,232
那个混球敢多看你一眼,我就给他一顿老拳
Any goon so much as looks at you,I'll sock him in the kisser.

190
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:17,533
不，说真的，你今晚可以放松放松
No. Seriously,you girls have a good time tonight.

191
00:08:17,917 --> 00:08:19,394
再见
Bye.

192
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,940

193
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,740

194
00:08:25,829 --> 00:08:30,548
Robin！Robin！嘿，我在这儿呢
Robin! Robin! Hey,I'm over here.

195
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,380

196
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:33,856
走-走-去费城！
G-g-goin' to philly!

197
00:08:34,106 --> 00:08:35,928
Marshall，别来费城了
Marshall,don't come to philly.

198
00:08:35,976 --> 00:08:37,510
但我们要开始一段冒险
But we're on an adventure.

199
00:08:37,606 --> 00:08:41,433
我们现在在费城机场，神经病的……冒险
We're on a tmac in philadelphia. Crazy... adventure.

200
00:08:42,334 --> 00:08:43,955
好吧
Fine.

201
00:08:44,569 --> 00:08:47,465
不！不！今晚才刚刚开始
No! No! The night has just started.

202
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:50,361
瞧，机场的酒吧，漂亮的空姐
Look,airport bar. Flight attendants.

203
00:08:50,409 --> 00:08:54,255
她们会为你服务，说：“什么？”
They'll get your tray table in its full upright position say what?!

204
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,940

205
00:08:54,725 --> 00:08:57,756
乘客Mosby先生和Stenson先生，两位请跟我们走一趟
Passengers mosby and stenson,please come with us,gentlemen.

206
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,012
把你们的手放在我看得见的地方
Keep your hands where I can see them.

207
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,438
Barney，我要宰了你
Barney,I am going to kill you.

208
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:04,757
别在机场安全人员面前说你要宰了谁
Don't say you're gonna kill someone in front of airport security.

209
00:09:04,891 --> 00:09:06,694
这可不好
Not cool,not cool.

210
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:09,130

211
00:09:08,276 --> 00:09:10,175
真是太让人生气了
This is an outrage!

212
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:14,817
我们是国际商人,我们要参加非常重要的国际会议
We are international businessmen on very important international business trip.

213
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,210

214
00:09:14,942 --> 00:09:17,195
我要求你们立刻释放我们
I demand you release us immediately!

215
00:09:17,234 --> 00:09:21,367
你要求？不，不，不，他没要求我们没有要求
You demand?!No,no,no,no,no. He does not demand.We-we-we-we have no demands.

216
00:09:21,406 --> 00:09:23,439
先生，你必须保持冷静
Sir,I'm gonna have to ask you to remain calm.

217
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,700

218
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:25,836
好的，好的，我很冷静
Okay. Yeah,I'm calm. I'm totally calm.

219
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:29,567
我们的监控录像显示，你们把两个行李箱留在肯尼迪机场3号行李传送带
We'v got footage of you placing two bags on jfk carousel 3,

220
00:09:29,672 --> 00:09:33,835
并且用现金购买最近的机票离开了
and abandoning them to purchase a last-minute flight with cash.

221
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:36,549
-那些箱子是你的责任-那是你的箱子！
--Those bags were your responsibility. 
--They were your bags!

222
00:09:36,606 --> 00:09:40,116
先生们，我们正在检查那些箱子
Sir,please. We're assessing the bag situation.

223
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:44,480

224
00:09:44,557 --> 00:09:46,763
听我说，这些只是误会
look,this is all just... it's a misunderstanding.

225
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,603
让我来
Please.

226
00:09:48,864 --> 00:09:51,116
我们是国际商人
We are international businessmen.

227
00:09:51,644 --> 00:09:53,965
我的同事不小心将行李遗留在那边
My colleague accidentally left the bags there.

228
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:58,866
现在，请让我们离开,不然我们会错过国际会议
Now,please let us go before we miss our international business meeting.

229
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,310

230
00:10:00,112 --> 00:10:04,812
我还从没见过哪个国际商人的衬衫是没有塞进去的
Can't remember the last time I saw an intertional businessman with an untucked shirt.

231
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:09,521
还有，我们收到了过去几个月拍下的监控录像
In addition,we received this footage taken over the last few months.

232
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,960

233
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:15,940

234
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,470

235
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,580

236
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,780

237
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:34,690

238
00:10:34,657 --> 00:10:37,601
相信我，那个箱子的办法很有用
Believe it or not,that duffel bag thing worked.

239
00:10:39,155 --> 00:10:39,817
事实上
The truth is,

240
00:10:39,913 --> 00:10:43,662
我的朋友，他在机场带着假旅行箱就是为了泡女孩子
my friend..he does this thing where he goes to airports with fake luggage to pick up girls

241
00:10:43,787 --> 00:10:47,988
而且我们跟着一对来到了费城,就是这样，全部经过
and we followed some here to philadelphia. That-that-that's it. That's all this is.

242
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,203
没人那么无聊
Nobody's that lame.

243
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:54,643
有，他就有那么无聊,告诉他你有那么无聊
Yes,he's that lame.Tell him you're that lame.

244
00:10:56,514 --> 00:10:58,873
-我们是国际商人-哦，得了吧
--We are international businessmen.--Oh,come on!

245
00:10:58,978 --> 00:11:02,191
先生，不要大声叫喊,不然我就把你铐起来
Sir,lower your voice,or I will restrain you.

246
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,723
伙计，说真的，放松
Dude,seriously,relax.

247
00:11:05,145 --> 00:11:07,936
-至少让我们打电话给我们的律师-说的正是！
--We at least get to call our lawyer.  
--Exactly!

248
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,290

249
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:09,969
我们有律师？
We have a lawyer?

250
00:11:10,784 --> 00:11:15,176
听我说，你们都是美国公民,别被他所谓的爱国招数骗了
Listen to me-- you're both american citizens. Don't let him pull any patriot act voodoo.

251
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,447
你们在律师不在场的时候有权拒绝回答任何问题
You both retain the right to refuse to answer any questions without an attorney present

252
00:11:18,456 --> 00:11:20,183
在我到之前什么也别说,听见了吗？
so don't say anything until I get there,all right?

253
00:11:20,739 --> 00:11:22,398
好的，拜拜
Okay. Good-bye.

254
00:11:22,609 --> 00:11:23,549
费城！
Philly!

255
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,656
冒险继续
The adventure continues

256
00:11:27,155 --> 00:11:29,409
破坏！
destroy!

257
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:32,250

258
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,511
这太荒唐了,我们去别的地方吧
It's ridiculous in here. Why don't we go somewhere else?

259
00:11:34,674 --> 00:11:37,733
不，这个地方不错
No,this place is great.

260
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,720

261
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:43,150

262
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:41,828
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

263
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:44,820
-怎么了？-你的嘴唇还有这一切
--What? 
--With your lips and everything?

264
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:48,110
我的嘴唇向来如此
My lips are always like this.

265
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,680

266
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,880


267
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,120

268
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,196
你偏要打肤色种族这张牌
You had to play the race card.

269
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:01,987
哦，放轻松，Ted我们没做错任何事
Oh,relax,ted. We didn't do anything wrong.

270
00:12:02,285 --> 00:12:06,658
还要顺便说一句，如果你早把衬衫塞好,我们早就可以走了
And,by the way,We'd be out of here by now if you had tucked in your shirt.

271
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,670

272
00:12:07,032 --> 00:12:09,305
说吧，肯尼迪机场行李箱是什么情况？
Go ahead,jfk. What is the baggage status?

273
00:12:09,602 --> 00:12:12,796
没问题了，只是满满一箱安全套
They're clean. It's just a whole bunch of condoms.And a powerbar.

274
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:14,060

275
00:12:13,026 --> 00:12:14,925

276
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,118
你们可以走了
You're free to go.

277
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,897
-别到费城来了-伙计，我都走到一半了！
Don't come to philly. Man,I'm almost halfway there.

278
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,045
我们刚被释放了,我们坐下一半飞机回来
Yeah,we just got released and we're headg back on the next flight.

279
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,069
我们在Mcclaren's见，也许还能喝几杯
Uh,meet us at mcclaren'S. Maybe we can still make last call.

280
00:12:26,347 --> 00:12:27,565
我们能不能就……
Can't we just,just...

281
00:12:27,757 --> 00:12:30,653
不，我们没有就什么,我们回家
no,we can't just. We're going home.

282
00:12:30,768 --> 00:12:32,370
我们要去Sasha家
We're going to sasha'S.

283
00:12:32,456 --> 00:12:33,262
Sasha是谁？
Who the hell is sasha?

284
00:12:33,549 --> 00:12:39,975
Sasha，她请了朋友到她家里去做客这肯定会是传……等等
Sasha. She's ving friends over for drin at her house. It's gonna be legen..wait for it

285
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,590

286
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:44,290
而且我希望你不对牛奶过敏,因为下一半是“奇性的”（Legen-dary，dary与乳制品谐音）
and I hope you're not lactose-intolerant 'cause the second half of that word is..dary!

287
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:45,806
-不-传奇性的
--No.  
--Legendary.

288
00:12:45,835 --> 00:12:49,402
-传奇？这听起来很酷-不，Marshall，我们要回家
--Legendary. That sounds awesome.  
--No,marshall,we're going back.

289
00:12:49,805 --> 00:12:53,411
好吧，别挂，我有个插拨
Fine. Hold on. I have another call. hello?

290
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:56,672
-Marshall，我们去Sasha家-不，我们不去
--Marshall,we're going to sasha'S.  
--No,we're not.

291
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,070

292
00:12:56,892 --> 00:12:59,664
Ted，Ted，Ted，看这儿,我们要去的
Ted,ted,ted. Right here. Yes,we are.

293
00:13:00,163 --> 00:13:02,857
对不起，伙计，二比一
sorry,buddy-- two against one.

294
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,640

295
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,684
-哦，瞧啊，一个包间空了-真的？
--Ooh,look,a booth opened up. 
--Really?

296
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:11,570

297
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,266
是啊，我想我们终于可以单独聊聊……但是
Yeah,I thought we could finally go talk... and

298
00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:10,463
你没有听我说话,我一个人去坐了
you're not listening to me,so I'm going to walk away.

299
00:13:10,568 --> 00:13:12,457
是啊是啊，包间
Yeah,yeah,booth.

300
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:16,070

301
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,650

302
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,400

303
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:22,997
我订婚了，我很抱歉，我把戒指取了
I'm engaged. Yeah,I'm sorry. I took my ring off.

304
00:13:23,055 --> 00:13:25,932
你能过来搭讪真的真的很好,只是我……
It's very,very sweet of you to come over and talk to me,but I just...

305
00:13:26,037 --> 00:13:31,024
嗯，我是个同性恋,我只是过来告诉你你坐在一个葡萄上了
yeah,I'm gay. I just came over to let you know that you sat on a grape.

306
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:32,100

307
00:13:32,386 --> 00:13:35,235
哦，真糟糕
Oh,damn it.

308
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,420

309
00:13:39,378 --> 00:13:42,111
于是Barney和我进了城，费城，宾州
So barney and I hit the town. Philadelphia,pa.

310
00:13:42,504 --> 00:13:43,943
我们第一站也是最后一站：
Our first and only stop:

311
00:13:44,537 --> 00:13:46,935
Sasha的派对
Sasha's party..

312
00:13:49,966 --> 00:13:53,994
-那么，嗯……你是Sasha的朋友？-我跟你说过了
--so,uh... you're sasha's friends,uh?  
--You know it.

313
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,430

314
00:13:55,461 --> 00:14:00,707
你们几个把声音调小一点,别把我爷爷吵醒了
You guys,keep the volume down. You're gonna wak my grandpa.

315
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,800

316
00:14:02,452 --> 00:14:04,342
谁想要柠檬汁？
Who wants hard lemonade?

317
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,19

318
00:14:11,295 --> 00:14:13,213
-费城！-嘘！
--Philly! 
--Shh!

319
00:14:13,942 --> 00:14:15,917
费城
Philly

320
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,270

321
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,390

322
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:24,968
回到酒吧，女孩子们的夜晚也不如Robin预期那么开心
Backed the bar:Girls' night out wasn't going as robin had hoped.

323
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:28,750

324
00:14:30,396 --> 00:14:31,029
Lily的手机
lily's phone.

325
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,254
Robin，嗯，Lily在哪儿？
Robin,uh,where's lily?

326
00:14:33,503 --> 00:14:34,951
她在，嗯……
She's,uh...

327
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:40,178
她是不是在和帅哥聊天？你可以跟我讲的，那是我的主意
is she talking to some hot guy? Oh,you can tell me. It's totally cool. It was my idea.

328
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,540

329
00:14:40,351 --> 00:14:42,221
我跟她说可以把戒指取了
Hell,I told her she could take the ring off.

330
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:45,635
真的？虽然我觉得这有点古怪,不过既然你不介意的话，是的，嗯
Really? Well,I thought it was kind of weird,but if you're cool with it,yeah,uh,

331
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,694
她取掉了，正和某个帅哥聊天呢,你要不要和她说……
it's off,and she's talking to some guy. Do you want me to go over and...

332
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:51,562
不，不用打搅她了,这很好
no,no,don't interrupt. It's awesome.

333
00:14:52,511 --> 00:14:55,034
这么说来，戒指真的被取掉了？
So,the ring really off,huh?

334
00:14:55,638 --> 00:14:57,537
很好
It's awesome.

335
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:04,960
嗯，就告诉她我打过电话了在告诉她，她很……很好
Well,just tell her I called. And tell her that she is... awesome.

336
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:05,630

337
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,950

338
00:15:08,805 --> 00:15:11,042
真的真的很好
Really,really awesome 

339
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:15,170

340
00:15:12,903 --> 00:15:17,071
我们的关系建立在相互信任的基础上
Our relationship is built on mutual trust

341
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,300

342
00:15:18,492 --> 00:15:20,659
我不能呼吸了
I can't breathe.

343
00:15:21,877 --> 00:15:24,917
听见了么，Ted？Dana是自由钟的保安（自由钟，费城的著名景点）
you hear that,ted? Dana works security at the liberty bell.

344
00:15:25,109 --> 00:15:27,008

345
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:28,610
喔，它肯定被禁止线保护得好好的
Wow,it must be really well cordoned off over there.

346
00:15:28,744 --> 00:15:30,959
你有没有走到禁止线后面去摸过它
Do you ever go behind the rope and touch it?

347
00:15:31,314 --> 00:15:33,357
家常便饭
Only all the time.

348
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:36,723
-你有没有把脑袋钻进去过-有
--You ever,like,stick your head inside it?  
--Yeah.

349
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:40,329
-你有没有舔过-没有
--You ever lick it?  
--Nope.

350
00:15:41,087 --> 00:15:43,120
我从来没有舔过
I have never licked it.

351
00:15:43,849 --> 00:15:47,906
嗯，我敢打赌历史上从来没有人舔过自由钟
Hmm. I bet nobody in history has ever licked the liberty bell.

352
00:15:48,232 --> 00:15:53,353
谁要是这么做了,我敢说那肯定是……什么来着？
If someone were to pull that off,I dare say it would be..what's the word?

353
00:15:53,938 --> 00:15:55,261
好了，我受够了
Well,this is my stop.

354
00:15:55,261 --> 00:15:57,208
传奇性的，Ted，传奇性的！
Legendary. Ted,legendary.

355
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,999
Barney，我要去机场了,Sasha，谢谢你，还有，嗯
Barney,I'm going to the airport. Sasha,thank you,and,uh,

356
00:16:00,172 --> 00:16:03,164
跟你爷爷说我很抱歉在厕所踩到他了
tell your grandpa I'm sorry I walked in on him in the bathroom.

357
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,000

358
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,240
我去拿点苏打水来洗掉污渍
I'll get some club soda for that stain.

359
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:08,120

360
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,620

361
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:13,416
Lily，我以为今晚只是我们俩的,你在干什么？
Lily,I thought tonight was about us hanging out. What are you doing?

362
00:16:13,713 --> 00:16:16,955
应付一下帅哥的搭讪啊
Just fending off the advances of that totally hot guy.

363
00:16:17,252 --> 00:16:21,031
-伙计，他是个同性恋-哦，我知道他是同性恋
--Dude,I think that guy is gay.--Oh,I know that guy is gay. 

364
00:16:21,194 --> 00:16:23,630
只是，Marshall和我在一起9年了
It's just,marshall and I have been together for nine years.

365
00:16:23,735 --> 00:16:25,759
我从高中开始就不是单身了
I haven't been single since high school.

366
00:16:26,238 --> 00:16:27,188
你想做单身么？
You want to be single?

367
00:16:27,715 --> 00:16:30,602
你想要一晚上疲于应付无聊的男人？你觉得这个很好玩吗？
You wa to fight off loser guys all night? Does that seem like fun to you?

368
00:16:30,832 --> 00:16:33,901
我只是想把网撒到海里去
I guess I just wanted to throw this net back into the ocean and

369
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:36,548
看看我还能捞多少鱼
see how many fish I could catch.

370
00:16:36,721 --> 00:16:39,406
到现在为止，一条同性恋海豚
So far,one. One gay dolphin.

371
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:40,998
还有Marshall
And marshall.

372
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:45,458
Lily，这里所有的女孩儿消磨一晚上就是想得到你已经拥有的
Lily,all these girls here tonight are all hoping to catch what you've already got.

373
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,950

374
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:47,673
你是对的，我知道
You're right. I know.

375
00:16:48,526 --> 00:16:51,854
嘿，你想不想喝点咖啡,我们好好聊聊
Hey,do you want to go get coffee and have an actualonversation?

376
00:16:52,132 --> 00:16:55,595
如果“咖啡”换成“奶酪蛋糕”我就答应你
If by "coffee" you mean "cheesecake," then yes.

377
00:16:55,997 --> 00:16:58,970
嘿，我弄了点苏打水,我们看看你的臀部
Hey,I got that club soda. Let's see that booty.

378
00:16:59,201 --> 00:17:01,320
哦，非常感谢
Oh,thank you so much.

379
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,260

380
00:17:04,974 --> 00:17:08,570
你想找麻烦吗，小子？你擦的屁股可是我未婚妻的
You want to mess,pal? That's my fiancee's hot backside at you're dabbing.

381
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,310

382
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:09,951
Marshall，不！
Marshall,no.

383
00:17:10,402 --> 00:17:14,171
宝贝，求你了，再也别把戒指取掉,不管我说那有多好
Baby,please,don't ever take that ring off again,no matter how awesome I say that it is.

384
00:17:14,305 --> 00:17:17,691
-没关系的，伙计……-退后，小子，我可不怕你
--It's okay,man...  
--Back off,hombre! I'm not that afraid to fig you.

385
00:17:17,988 --> 00:17:20,750
你想尝尝拳头的滋味吗,来啊，来啊
You want to test this guy,be my guest,come on.

386
00:17:20,827 --> 00:17:24,864
-Marshall，他是同性恋-哦，谢天谢地，我从没打过架
--Marshall,he's gay.  
--oh,thank god. I've never been ia fight before.

387
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,800

388
00:17:25,363 --> 00:17:27,358
可不是
You don't say.

389
00:17:27,636 --> 00:17:30,389
原来Marshall叔叔其实是个醋坛子
So,it turned out uncle marshall really was the jealous type.

390
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:34,560
不幸的是，那个同性恋的男朋友……同样也是醋坛子
Unfortunately,that guy's boyfriend..also the jealous type.

391
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,370

392
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,890

393
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:42,340

394
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,412
本可以舔自由钟
Could have licked the liberty bell.

395
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,900

396
00:17:47,661 --> 00:17:50,058
我们去机场
We're going to the airport.

397
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:54,882
bang……bang……ba
Bong... bong... bo...

398
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:55,740

399
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,836
我干嘛和你一起疯？为什么？
why do I hang out with you? Why?

400
00:17:58,162 --> 00:18:00,876
我需要的只是寻常一杯啤酒在我寻常的酒吧
All I wanted was to have a regular beer at my regular bar 

401
00:18:01,078 --> 00:18:03,370
和我一帮寻常的朋友呆在寻常的城市
with my regular friends in my regular city.

402
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:08,952
-Ted，Ted，Ted，你都没看我-不，我不看
--Ted,ted,ted. You're not even looking. 
--No,I'm not.

403
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,490

404
00:18:09,249 --> 00:18:13,354
听着，我们的先辈们为了追求幸福而抛头颅洒热血
Look,our forefathers died for the pursuit of happiness,okay?

405
00:18:13,507 --> 00:18:16,538
而不是坐在原地等着幸福降临
Not for the sit around and wait of happiness.

406
00:18:16,633 --> 00:18:18,599
现在如果你愿意，你可以去同一间酒吧
Now,if you want,you can go to the same bar,

407
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:21,333
喝同样的啤酒，和同样的人说话
drink the same beer,talk to the same people every day,

408
00:18:21,486 --> 00:18:24,210
或者，你可以去舔自由钟
or you can lick the liberty bell.

409
00:18:24,584 --> 00:18:29,859
你可以扼住命运的咽喉舔得它七荤八素！
You can grab life by the crack and lick the crap out of it.

410
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:30,400

411
00:18:31,307 --> 00:18:33,350
说的很好，伙计
That was beautiful,man.

412
00:18:33,982 --> 00:18:35,200
谢谢你，Leonard
Thanks,leonard.

413
00:18:35,603 --> 00:18:38,010
Ted，你就要错过人生重要的一课了
Ted,you're missing out on a valuable life lesson here.

414
00:18:38,068 --> 00:18:41,636
听着，我不需要你来教我怎么生活,我知道怎么生活
Look,I don't need you to teach me how to live,okay? I know how to live.

415
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:44,609
如果你想舔自由钟，自己去好了
If you want to go lick the liberty bell,just go lick it yourself.

416
00:18:44,733 --> 00:18:45,999
不行，必须是我们两个人
No it has to be the two of us.

417
00:18:46,066 --> 00:18:50,181
-为什么，为什么要拉上我？-因为，你是我最好的朋友
--Why? Why do you need me?  
--Because you're my best friend,all right?

418
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:52,860

419
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:54,822
你不一定要说我是你最好的朋友,但在我看来，我们是一队的
You don't have to tell me I'm yours,but the way I see it,we're a team.

420
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:57,450

421
00:18:55,417 --> 00:19:00,183
没有你，我只是个精力充沛的妄想狂
Without you,I'M... I'm just the dynamic uno

422
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:00,770

423
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,177
好吧，如果你想回家，我们就回家吧
So,fine if you want to go home,then we'll go home.

424
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,770

425
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,770

426
00:19:09,822 --> 00:19:11,232
好吧
Fine.

427
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,325
我们去舔自由钟
We'lgo lick the liberty bell.

428
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:16,094
很好，因为我们到了
Good 'cause we're here.

429
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:20,218
我不知道Barney怎么偷偷让司机改变了方向,不过我们下了车
I had no idea how barney redirected the cab without me knowing,but we got out,

430
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,230

431
00:19:20,506 --> 00:19:23,977
Dana让我们进去，我们舔了自由钟
dana let us in,and by god,we licked the liberty bell.

432
00:19:24,505 --> 00:19:26,097
你知道它舔起来什么感觉吗？
You know what it tastes like?

433
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:27,439
什么？
What?

434
00:19:28,744 --> 00:19:29,708
自由
Freedom. 

435
00:19:30,317 --> 00:19:31,933
不，说实话，舔起来和硬币一样
No,actually,it tastes like pennies.

436
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,908
哦，天哪，你们真的那么干了？
Oh,my god. Did you guys really do that?

437
00:19:36,061 --> 00:19:37,126
我们真的舔了
We really did.

438
00:19:37,452 --> 00:19:39,993
而且我终于发现我为什么和Barney交朋友
And that was when I realized why iung out with barney.

439
00:19:40,338 --> 00:19:44,558
我永远不会料到下一站是哪儿,但我总会经历一个好故事
I never got where I thought I wanted to go,but I always got a great story.

440
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,658
那么，和你聊天的那个女的……是妈妈吗？
So,that girl you were talking to..that was mom?

441
00:19:50,955 --> 00:19:54,321
孩子们，一个男人生命中的每个故事就好比一个印象派画家作品中的一个色点
Kids,every story in a man's life is like a dot in an impressionist painting..

442
00:19:54,686 --> 00:19:55,904
答案是否定的？
so that's a no?

443
00:19:56,354 --> 00:19:57,975
是的，不是你们妈妈
Yeah,that's a no

444
00:19:58,627 --> 00:20:01,399
怎么了，听我说啊
What? come on!

445
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,870

446
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,170

447
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:11,090

448
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,300

449
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,700

450
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:20,170

451
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,530

452
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:24,800

453
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,790

454
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:32,550

455
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,910

456
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:42,730

457
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,380

458
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,540

459
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,110

460
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
cece，我爱你
