How I met your mother
Season 01 Episode 08

4
00:00:12,725 --> 00:00:16,178
孩子们, 纽约有很多栋楼房
Kids,there are many buildings in new york city.

5
00:00:16,226 --> 00:00:18,240
上千的公寓
Thousands of apartments,

6
00:00:18,383 --> 00:00:20,110
和无数的发生在其中的故事
millions of stories.

7
00:00:20,158 --> 00:00:23,706
尽管已经是十几年前的事了
现在已经不知道是谁住那
And even though it's been decades and someone else lives there now,

8
00:00:23,754 --> 00:00:28,981
那座公寓永远是
对我们而言特殊的地方
there's one apartment in particular that will always be our apartment.

9
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:31,474
在那我有如此多的美好回忆
I have so many great memories of that place.

10
00:00:31,522 --> 00:00:33,776
Marshall玩电子游戏
Marshall playing video games.

11
00:00:33,968 --> 00:00:36,653
Lily在安全出口那画画
Lily painting on the fire escape.

12
00:00:38,523 --> 00:00:40,633
抱歉, Matson先生
Sorry,mr. Matson.

13
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:43,223
还有我煮咖啡
And me making the coffee.

14
00:00:43,271 --> 00:00:44,278
这个咖啡壶
I had this coffee pot

15
00:00:44,325 --> 00:00:46,435
已经50岁了
it was probably 50 years old at the time,

16
00:00:46,483 --> 00:00:48,641
煮出来的咖啡真的很难喝
and it made truly terrible coffee.

17
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:50,655
我们叫他Shocky
We called it shocky.

18
00:00:50,703 --> 00:00:53,580
- 插插头
- 保存
-Plugging in. -Saving game.

19
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,382
我喜欢在那里的每一样东西
I loved every last detail of that place,

20
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,835
用强力胶黏在墙上的两把剑
right down to the incredibly tacky swords we hung on the wall.

21
00:01:02,883 --> 00:01:05,089
永远也不想把它们换下来
I never wanted any of it to change.

22
00:01:05,137 --> 00:01:07,630
但生活并不可能停滞不前
But that's not how life works.

23
00:01:09,021 --> 00:01:11,514
你们肯定想不到
我们刚刚经历了什么
You guys will never believe what just happened to us.

24
00:01:11,562 --> 00:01:13,049
我自己都不敢相信
I don't even believe it myself.

25
00:01:13,097 --> 00:01:16,309
我们在皇后大道
准备顺便去我的公寓看看
We were in queens,and we decided to stop by my apartment.

26
00:01:16,357 --> 00:01:20,146
等等, 她的公寓?我以为Lily阿姨
和你还有Marshall叔叔一起住
Wait,her apartment? I thought aunt lily lived with you and uncle marshall.

27
00:01:20,194 --> 00:01:22,208
我能理解你们为什么这么想
I could see how you would think that,

28
00:01:22,256 --> 00:01:25,612
但是我得有我自己的私人空间
这是独立的问题
but I have to have my own place. It's an independence thing.

29
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,530
上次你去那是什么时候的事了?
When was the last time you were there?

30
00:01:27,578 --> 00:01:29,113
三个月前
Three months ago.

31
00:01:29,257 --> 00:01:31,798
什么? 这就象那些超大的内裤
What? It's like fat pants.

32
00:01:31,846 --> 00:01:36,210
你永远不会想去用它
但只要知道它在那就行了
You hope you never have to use them,but you're glad to know they're there.

33
00:01:37,696 --> 00:01:39,902
- 到底怎么了?
- 怎么了?
-What the hell? -What?

34
00:01:40,525 --> 00:01:42,587
这是我的公寓
This is my apartment.

35
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:45,177
- 哪儿?
- 就在这
-Where? -Right here.

36
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:48,581
到底怎么了?
What the hell?

37
00:01:48,917 --> 00:01:50,835
Lily, 这明显是家中国餐厅
Lily,this is a chinese restaurant.

38
00:01:50,883 --> 00:01:54,096
不, 不对, 这里是我的公寓
No,no,this was my apartment.

39
00:01:54,144 --> 00:01:55,822
我的衣橱在那儿...
My dresser was right...

40
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,836
那就是我的衣橱!
that's my dresser!

41
00:01:58,987 --> 00:02:01,145
这里是我的储物间
And this is my closet.

42
00:02:01,193 --> 00:02:05,460
我把指甲屑倒在这
这里还有碎屑
And I spilled nail polh there. There's the stain.

43
00:02:05,508 --> 00:02:07,426
嗨 几位?
Hi. How many?

44
00:02:07,474 --> 00:02:08,721
Lily
Lily.

45
00:02:08,817 --> 00:02:10,399
对 你知道我?
Yes.You know me?

46
00:02:10,495 --> 00:02:12,749
是啊
你的返校节照片
Yeah. From your homecoming picture.

47
00:02:12,797 --> 00:02:15,722
你本人看起来好看多了
You're much prettier in person.

48
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,455
对, 我就知道
不该弄那些刘海
Yeah,I know,the bangs were a mistake.

49
00:02:18,503 --> 00:02:20,325
我的东西呢?!
Where's my stuff?!

50
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:21,572
噢, 都在后面呢
Oh,it's all in the back.

51
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,881
我们可以帮你打包
你要带走吗?
We could wrap it up for you. You want it to go?

52
00:02:24,929 --> 00:02:27,087
这是我的公寓
This is my apartment.

53
00:02:27,135 --> 00:02:29,388
现在不是了
Not anymore.

54
00:02:29,628 --> 00:02:31,642
没门 你得索要赔偿
No way. You're making this up.

55
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,848
公寓必须得以某种方式
通知你这件事才对
Yeah,the building would have had to give you some kind of notice.

56
00:02:33,896 --> 00:02:35,622
他们给你发通知了
They sent you a notice about this.

57
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,116
- 什么时候?
- 三个月前
-When? -Three months ago.

58
00:02:38,164 --> 00:02:40,945
这些是你的邮件 除去杂志
And here's your mail. Minus magazines.

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,500
嗯, 法律上来说他们不能就这样
把你丢在街上 你有租约
Well,still legally,they can't just toss you out on the street. You have a lease.

60
00:02:45,548 --> 00:02:51,686
我是没有书面上的合约
但去问问我的房东 Conroy夫人
Okay,so I didn't have a written lease as such,but go ask my landlady,mrs. Conroy.

61
00:02:51,734 --> 00:02:55,330
她虽然已经98岁了, 但她还是...
She may be 98 years old,but she's still...

62
00:02:55,378 --> 00:02:56,865
她死了, 是吗?
she's dead,isn't she?

63
00:02:56,913 --> 00:02:59,214
甚至没看到巴士
Never even saw the bus.

64
00:02:59,838 --> 00:03:03,722
我的公寓变成了中国餐厅
My apartment is a chinese restaurant.

65
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,208
我要怎么办?
What am I going to do?

66
00:03:05,256 --> 00:03:07,031
来和我们一起住吧
Come live with us.

67
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:09,093
-真的吗? 
-当然
Really? Of course.

68
00:03:09,141 --> 00:03:10,339
你确定同意吗, Ted?
You sure about this,ted?

69
00:03:10,435 --> 00:03:13,025
嗯 我说, 你基本上可以说
是一直住在这了
Yeah. I mean,you basically live here anyway.

70
00:03:13,073 --> 00:03:14,559
不会改变任何事情
It's not like it'll change anything.

71
00:03:14,607 --> 00:03:17,101
错, 这会改变任何事情
No,it's like it will change everything.

72
00:03:17,149 --> 00:03:19,306
噢, Ted, 你太差了
Oh,ted,you are so screwed.

73
00:03:19,354 --> 00:03:20,553
你们在说什么?
What are you talking about?

74
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:23,238
为什么那女的一直盯着你?
And why is that girl checking you out?

75
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,588
因为我帅
Because I look good.

76
00:03:25,684 --> 00:03:28,417
听好 你和Marshall是室友
Now,focus. You and Marshall are roommates.

77
00:03:28,465 --> 00:03:31,534
你们有间很棒的公寓
Marshall和Lily刚订婚了
You have an amazing apartment. Marshall and lily just got engaged.

78
00:03:31,582 --> 00:03:32,579
那又怎样?
Yeah,so?

79
00:03:32,589 --> 00:03:35,658
那么，当他结婚时你就
不再是他的室友啦, 是不?
So,you're not still going to be his roommate when he gets married,are you?

80
00:03:35,706 --> 00:03:37,988
得有人搬出去
你觉得会是谁呢?
Someone's going to move out. So who's it going to be?

81
00:03:38,008 --> 00:03:40,501
拜托, Barney
他们肯定讨论过谁搬出去
Come on,barney,I'm sure they've talked about who gets the apartment.

82
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:42,227
你们有谈过这些, 是吗?
You've talked about who gets the apartment,right?

83
00:03:42,275 --> 00:03:44,050
对, 我们是有谈过
Yeah,we've talked about it.

84
00:03:44,241 --> 00:03:50,331
那么我和Lily结婚时
谁会得到这间公寓?
So when lily and I get married,who's going to get the apartment?

85
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:52,249
噢, 这个很难决定
Oh,that's a tough one.

86
00:03:52,825 --> 00:03:56,277
-你知道谁能解决这问题吗?
- 谁?
You know who I think could handle a problem like that? Who?

87
00:03:56,805 --> 00:04:00,018
未来的Ted和Marshall
Future Ted and future Marshall.

88
00:04:00,737 --> 00:04:03,758
是哦
让他们去解决吧
Totally. Let's let those guys handle it.

89
00:04:03,854 --> 00:04:06,012
该死, 过去的Ted
Damn it,past Ted.

90
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:08,169
你完蛋了, 小子
You blew it,dude.

91
00:04:08,217 --> 00:04:10,183
Lily已经搬进去了
已经是新的局面了
Now that lily's there,it's a whole new dynamic.

92
00:04:10,231 --> 00:04:11,238
他们要把你挤出去了
They're edging you out.

93
00:04:11,286 --> 00:04:12,149
这不可能
That's crazy.

94
00:04:12,197 --> 00:04:15,122
他们不会把我挤出去
Marshall是我最好的朋友
They're not edging me out. Marshall's my best friend.

95
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:17,712
我最好朋友之一
one of my best friends.

96
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,630
他不会那样对我的
He wouldn't do that to me.

97
00:04:20,014 --> 00:04:22,411
你小心点就是了
这就是我要说的, Teddy
Just keep your eyes open,that's all I'm saying,Teddy.

98
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:25,096
你公寓里将有微妙的变化
Little things are going to be changing around that apartment.

99
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:27,015
拜托, Barney
你想太多了
Come on,Barney,you're just being paranoid.

100
00:04:27,043 --> 00:04:30,208
我说, 那女的到底怎么了?
Okay,seriously,what is this girl's deal?

101
00:04:30,832 --> 00:04:33,996
- 我可以说和她在约会
- 什么?
-I'm sort of on a date with her. -What?

102
00:04:34,485 --> 00:04:35,838
我在网上认识她的
I found her online.

103
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:39,578
我厌倦了酒吧, 一夜情
I'm tired of the whole bar scene,the one-night hookups.

104
00:04:39,607 --> 00:04:41,688
我在寻找我的最终伴侣
I'm looking for a soul mate.

105
00:04:41,736 --> 00:04:44,613
可以让我去爱去拥抱的人
Someone who I can love and cuddle.

106
00:04:44,661 --> 00:04:47,874
我网上的自我描述是这么说的
Or so it says in my profile.

107
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,518
但是这女孩...
but this girl...

108
00:04:51,614 --> 00:04:53,772
她也想要同样的东西
她...
she wants the same stuff.  And it's...

109
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,306
她让我灰心了
it's bumming me out.

110
00:04:55,335 --> 00:04:57,560
- 好吧, Ted, 从医院打给我
- 好的
-All right,Ted,call me from the hospital. -All right.

111
00:04:57,618 --> 00:04:58,615
你要去医院?
You're going to the hospital?

112
00:04:58,663 --> 00:05:00,581
不是, 他回到那儿
我给他打电话
No. See,he's going to go back over there,and I'm going to call him.

113
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:03,640
他就装做是家里从医院
给他打的紧急电话
He's going to pretend it's an emergency call from a family member at the hospital.

114
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:09,260
噢, 天, 假装家里出事?这是
小说里最笨, 最差劲的逃避方式
Oh,lord,fake emergency? That is the lamest,most pathetic cop-out in the book.

115
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:11,562
- 我对你期望更高点
- 嗯, 还是得这样
-I expect more from you,barney. -Well,stay tuned.

116
00:05:11,591 --> 00:05:13,240
我在试着发现新方法
I'm working on some stuff.

117
00:05:13,288 --> 00:05:16,069
打电话的同时, 祝我好运
But in the meantime,wish me luck.

118
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,829
你要去和Marshall谈谈吗?
So,are you going to talk to marshall?

119
00:05:19,848 --> 00:05:22,092
他会想要那公寓, 我也想要
He's going to want the apartment,I'm going to want the apartment.

120
00:05:22,111 --> 00:05:24,451
这会导致争执
所以我不要谈
It's going to lead to an argument. So.no.

121
00:05:24,471 --> 00:05:26,312
呃, 这很有助健康
Hmm,that's real healthy.

122
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:31,174
当有问题来临时
你的方式就是躲开?
So when a serious issue comes up,your response is just to avoid it?

123
00:05:31,213 --> 00:05:33,380
我得打电话了
I should really make this call.

124
00:05:33,677 --> 00:05:36,344
噢 我能来吗?
Whoo,can I do it?

125
00:05:42,155 --> 00:05:43,134
你好
Hello.

126
00:05:43,162 --> 00:05:45,368
嗨... 性感小子
Hi,there... sexy.

127
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,958
你好, Cathy阿姨
有什么事吗?
Hello,aunt cathy. What's up?

128
00:05:47,967 --> 00:05:49,252
噢, 没什么
Oh,nothing.

129
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:53,280
只是坐在这想着你, 辣小伙
Just sitting here thinking about you,hot stuff.

130
00:05:53,338 --> 00:05:55,112
事故?
An accident?

131
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,980
那Rudy叔叔还好吧?
Ll,is uncle rudy going to be okay?

132
00:05:58,037 --> 00:06:03,926
Cathy阿姨身上痒痒
只有你能抓, 大块头
Aunt cathy's got an itch that only you can scratch,big boy.

133
00:06:03,974 --> 00:06:09,008
噢, 天那 为什么他会认为
能自己制造直升机?
Oh,god.Why did he think he could build his own helicopter?

134
00:06:09,018 --> 00:06:14,187
噢, 来吧, 伙计, 把我撕成碎片
Oh,come on,daddy,break me off a piece of that white chocolate.

135
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:17,400
嗯, 如果他需要移植, 我愿意
Well,if he needs a transplant,he can have mine.

136
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:20,229
我马上去那
I'll be right there.

137
00:06:20,277 --> 00:06:21,812
你知道... 我...
You know... I...

138
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,367
一会见

139
00:06:27,278 --> 00:06:29,388
记在我帐上
Put it on my check.

140
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:35,622
啊, 这会很不错的
我们仨住一起
Ah,this will be nice. The three of us living together.

141
00:06:35,718 --> 00:06:37,924
完美的组合
I think it's a good setup.

142
00:06:38,624 --> 00:06:40,705
天, 这咖啡很不错
Man,this coffee's great.

143
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,925
真的很不错
It's really great.

144
00:06:46,171 --> 00:06:47,562
太棒了
Too great.

145
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:52,501
shocky怎么了?
What happened to shocky?

146
00:06:58,978 --> 00:06:59,985
这是什么?
What's this?

147
00:07:00,023 --> 00:07:01,903
我从我公寓拿来的咖啡机
My coffeemaker from my apartment.

148
00:07:01,951 --> 00:07:03,581
煮的咖啡很好喝, 不是吗?
It makes great coffee,right?

149
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:05,355
是啊, 确实
Yeah,definitely.

150
00:07:05,403 --> 00:07:07,178
我是说, Shocky煮的也好喝
I mean,so does shocky.

151
00:07:07,225 --> 00:07:11,493
是吗? 我一直觉得Shocky
煮的咖啡很难入口
Really? I always thought shocky's coffee tasted kind of rusty.

152
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:16,528
对, 不, 的确
我说, 我有点喜欢那种味道
Yeah,no,it did. I mean,I kind of liked the rusty taste.

153
00:07:16,576 --> 00:07:18,686
我可能习惯那种味道了
我也不知道
I'm used to it,I don't know.

154
00:07:18,926 --> 00:07:21,803
Lily的咖啡机也不会
你知道
Also,lily's coffeemaker doesn't,you know,

155
00:07:21,851 --> 00:07:23,625
震撼人
shock people.

156
00:07:24,105 --> 00:07:29,044
不, 只是... 你得承认它
它... 每天早晨叫你起床
No,it's just... you got to admit that shock,that... wakes you up in the morning.

157
00:07:29,092 --> 00:07:32,928
不知道还有什么
能让你起床吗? 咖啡
You know what else wakes you up in the morning? Coffee.

158
00:07:33,695 --> 00:07:36,284
不错 你是对的
That's great. You're right.

159
00:07:36,716 --> 00:07:39,833
室友们 我喜欢
Roomies. I love it.

160
00:07:40,696 --> 00:07:43,477
他们在挤我出去
他们确实是在挤我出去
They're edging me out. They're totally edging me out.

161
00:07:43,525 --> 00:07:45,491
- 我不敢相信, 但你是对的
- 我就说
I didn't believe it,but you're right.  Told you.

162
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,978
那个Lily
她很精
That lily-- she's a shrewd one.

163
00:07:47,026 --> 00:07:52,156
是啊, 她给你了个
新的咖啡机-- 她怎么敢
Yeah,she got you a nice new coffeemaker-- how dare she.

164
00:07:52,185 --> 00:07:53,883
不只是咖啡机
It's not just the coffeemaker.

165
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:56,808
完成了 我的画完成了
Done. The painting's done.

166
00:07:57,211 --> 00:07:59,896
- 太棒了
- 很不错
-That is great. -nice

167
00:07:59,973 --> 00:08:01,507
你想挂在哪?
Where do you want to hang it?

168
00:08:01,555 --> 00:08:03,857
我不知道 呃...
I don't know. Uh...

169
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,168
钢琴上?
over the piano?

170
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:08,700
对哦, 那地方很适合
Yeah,that would be a good place for it.

171
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:13,322
已经有两把破剑在那了
我们很喜欢那两把剑
Too bad the swords are there. We kind of love those swords.

172
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,324
这两把剑在那已经很久了
Well,those swords have been up there a long time.

173
00:08:16,372 --> 00:08:19,316
我知道, 是不?
我会很想念它们的
I know,right? I'd really miss them,too.

174
00:08:19,547 --> 00:08:22,270
那么放在Marshall的房间吧
So,maybe marshall's room.

175
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,725
好吧
Okay.

176
00:08:25,032 --> 00:08:26,682
他要把那两把剑取下来
He was going to take the swords down.

177
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:27,881
你们相信吗?
Can you believe that?

178
00:08:27,929 --> 00:08:30,854
Ted, 你干嘛不干脆去和他谈谈
他是你最好的朋友
Ted,why don't you just talk to him. He's your best friend.

179
00:08:33,136 --> 00:08:35,237
最好朋友之一
one of your best friends.

180
00:08:36,023 --> 00:08:38,670
重点是, 这是友好谈判
The point is,maybe it's time for some healthy communication.

181
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:42,266
友好谈判? 这是最烂的主意
Healthy communication? That's the worst idea ever.

182
00:08:42,286 --> 00:08:44,520
听着, 你开始已经退让过了
这很好
Look,you held off their first advance. That's good.

183
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:46,726
现在是时候反击了
Now it's time to counterstrike.

184
00:08:46,774 --> 00:08:48,116
我该怎么做?
Well,what am I supposed to do?

185
00:08:48,136 --> 00:08:49,843
你得划分出你的领地
You got to mark your territory.

186
00:08:49,872 --> 00:08:52,260
我不是说不去厕所嘘嘘了
And I don't mean missing the toilet.

187
00:08:52,288 --> 00:08:54,398
你得做点大事件
You've got to do something big.

188
00:08:54,446 --> 00:08:58,580
- 什么?例如买个新沙发
- 更大的
-What,-like buy a new sofa?
-Bigger.

189
00:08:58,599 --> 00:08:59,577
Katie来了
Katie's here.

190
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,687
好吧, 我快点说... 
昨晚, 我突然领悟到
Okay,real quick... last night,epiphany--

191
00:09:01,735 --> 00:09:03,509
约会需要的是什么
I realized what the world of dating needs.

192
00:09:03,557 --> 00:09:05,763
准备好?
产品质量法
Ready? A lemon law.

193
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:07,681
就象给汽车规定的?
A lemon law like for cars?

194
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,928
完全正确
Exactly.

195
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:13,771
约会开始的一瞬间，你有五分钟
决定是否愿意花上整晚时间
From the moment the date begins,you have five minutes to decide whether you're going to commit to an entire evening.

196
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,504
如果你不愿意, 不会让对方难过
只用说晚上好
And if you don't,it's no hard feelings. Just,"good night.

197
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:18,230
谢谢参与 永远别见
Thanks for playing. See you never.

198
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:22,210
哈? 哈? 质量法
这将是个大发明
" Huh? Huh? The lemon law-- it's going to be a thing.

199
00:09:22,249 --> 00:09:24,876
可能的话, 现在就开始执行
Possibly,starting right now.

200
00:09:26,507 --> 00:09:28,252
嗨, Katie
Barney
Hi,katie. Barney.

201
00:09:28,281 --> 00:09:32,041
嗨 终于见到你了
Hi. It's good to finally meet you.

202
00:09:36,068 --> 00:09:39,933
嗯,是啊
Katie, 你将成为历史新篇章
Hmm,yeah. Katie,you are about to be a part of history.

203
00:09:45,371 --> 00:09:47,452
告诉你的朋友们
Tell your friends.

204
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:49,783
这将是个大发明
It's going to be a thing.

205
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,612
天, Ted最近很奇怪
Man,ted's been acting weird.

206
00:09:52,631 --> 00:09:54,818
他开始标记他所有的食物
He started labeling all his food.

207
00:09:54,837 --> 00:09:57,743
他甚至在那块奶酪上
刻上 Ted
He even carved "ted" into that block of cheese.

208
00:09:57,752 --> 00:10:01,061
是啊 现在成ed了
Yeah. Well,now it's ed'S.

209
00:10:02,413 --> 00:10:04,667
我觉得他不是
很适应我搬进来
I think he's not cool with me moving in.

210
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:06,470
不, 不是这个
No,that's not it.

211
00:10:06,508 --> 00:10:08,244
你以前就算是住在这了
You've basically lived here all along.

212
00:10:08,263 --> 00:10:09,587
Ted喜欢你
Ted loves you.

213
00:10:09,635 --> 00:10:11,985
他的经前综合症为什么又犯了？
So what's he pmsing about?

214
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,183
我也不知道
I don't know.

215
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,444
他准备和我谈的时候
他就会过来找我谈了
But when he's ready to talk to me about it,he'll come and talk to me about it.

216
00:10:16,492 --> 00:10:19,849
你在开玩笑吗?
你们两什么都没谈过
Are you kidding? You guys never talk about anything.

217
00:10:19,897 --> 00:10:24,692
他不会提起来直到他做出什么怪的事
he'll just let it fester under the surface until he doesn't something big and passive-aggressive.

218
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,898
你一点也不了解Ted
You clearly don't know ted.

219
00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:29,679
Ted Mosby的货物
Delivery for ted mosby.

220
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,920
你的电话亭送来了
Your english phone booth arrived.

221
00:10:37,015 --> 00:10:40,324
噢, 太棒了! 
这太棒了, 是不?
Oh,awesome! It's great,right?

222
00:10:40,372 --> 00:10:44,832
是啊, 我只是不确定
Lily会不会喜欢它
Yeah,I guess I'm just not sure if lily's going to like it.

223
00:10:45,407 --> 00:10:50,010
嗯, 我喜欢
所以我要把它放这儿
Well,I like it,so I'm just going to keep it right here,

224
00:10:50,058 --> 00:10:51,881
如果没问题的话
if that's cool. 

225
00:10:52,168 --> 00:10:53,415
当然
Of course.

226
00:10:53,463 --> 00:10:55,189
我是说, 我们都住这
所以...
I mean,we all live here,so... 

227
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,539
我们得尊重每个人的喜好
we should all be able to have things the way we want them.

228
00:10:57,587 --> 00:10:58,786
对啊
Exactly. 

229
00:10:58,834 --> 00:11:01,039
那好 太好了
Great. Terrific.

230
00:11:01,087 --> 00:11:03,533
你喜欢这电话亭
就让它放那
You like the phone booth,it stays.

231
00:11:03,581 --> 00:11:05,691
我喜欢这幅画...
I like this painting... 

232
00:11:05,739 --> 00:11:08,136
我要把它挂在...
so I'm just going to hang it... 

233
00:11:08,616 --> 00:11:10,918
这面墙上
right here on the wall.

234
00:11:17,727 --> 00:11:19,069
噢 就象这样, 是不?
Mm. Oh. So it's like that,is it?

235
00:11:21,994 --> 00:11:22,953
噢, 你好, 总督
Oh,hello,governor.

236
00:11:23,001 --> 00:11:25,111
噢, 就这样, 对吗? 再见
Oh,it's like that,isn't it? Cheerio.

237
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:27,605
对, 就这样
Yeah,it's like that.

238
00:11:28,084 --> 00:11:29,427
我想要这间公寓
I want this apartment.

239
00:11:29,475 --> 00:11:31,537
嗯, 我也想要
Well,I want it,too.

240
00:11:31,968 --> 00:11:33,119
你真是个混蛋
You're a jerk.

241
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:34,798
不对, 我是很有远见的
No,I'm a visionary.

242
00:11:34,846 --> 00:11:37,243
产品质量法! 这将会实现的
Lemon law! It's going to be a thing.

243
00:11:39,928 --> 00:11:45,491
说实话, 你的质量法是这个
浅尝辄止的社会的缩影
For the record,your little lemon law is a symbol of everything that's wrong with our no-attention-span society.

244
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:48,080
不 错了 质量法是很棒
No. Wrong. Lemon law's awesome.

245
00:11:48,128 --> 00:11:51,389
需要比五分钟更多的
时间才能了解一个人
It takes longer than five minutes to really get to know someone.

246
00:11:51,437 --> 00:11:55,033
你判断一个人太快了
可能会错过很多好东西
You keep giving up on people so quickly. You could miss out on something great.

247
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,527
好吧, 你将要约会
一个没见过的家伙
Okay,you're on a blind date.

248
00:11:57,575 --> 00:12:01,075
坐在对面的... 那家伙
Sitting across from the table is... that guy.

249
00:12:01,123 --> 00:12:06,206
你真需要超过五分钟
来确定没有第二人选了吗?
You really think it'll take more than five minutes to realize there will be no date number two?

250
00:12:06,254 --> 00:12:07,549
是, 我需要
Yes,I do. 

251
00:12:07,597 --> 00:12:10,474
我知道的是
那家伙是我的灵魂伴侣
For all I know,that guy's my soul mate. 

252
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,598
噢... 你错大了, Scherbotsky
Oh... bad move,scherbotsky.

253
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:19,057
嗨 见过Robin吗?
Hi. Have you met robin? 

254
00:12:19,297 --> 00:12:21,311
- 嗨
- 嗨
-Hi. -Hi.

255
00:12:23,037 --> 00:12:26,873
好了, Marshall，我们来
决定谁将得到这间公寓
All right,marshall,we're deciding right now who gets this apartment.

256
00:12:26,921 --> 00:12:28,983
可能会导致争执
May lead to an argument,

257
00:12:29,031 --> 00:12:30,662
但我们得解决问题
but we're settling this.

258
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:34,018
- 或者我们可以扔硬币
- 好, 来扔硬币吧
-Or we could flip a coin. -Yeah,let's flip a coin.

259
00:12:35,553 --> 00:12:36,560
- 扔吧
- 好
Flip it. Okay. 

260
00:12:36,608 --> 00:12:38,430
- 我要扔了 来了
- 扔啊
-I'm flipping it. Here I go. -Flip it.

261
00:12:38,478 --> 00:12:40,444
- 好, 我要扔了
- 快扔吧
-Okay,here I go. -Flip it. 

262
00:12:40,492 --> 00:12:42,362
我扔了
I'm flipping. 

263
00:12:43,081 --> 00:12:44,855
我扔之前, 我想说几句
But before I do,I just want to say something.

264
00:12:44,903 --> 00:12:46,582
一开始你甚至不愿意搬进来
You didn't even want to move in here in the first place.

265
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,548
你说战前建筑
对你的过敏不好
You said a pre-war building was bad for your allergies.

266
00:12:48,596 --> 00:12:49,315
那是五年前了
That was five years ago.

267
00:12:49,363 --> 00:12:51,665
现在在药房就能拿到
抗组胺剂的药方
Now you can get prescription-level antihistamines over the counter.

268
00:12:51,713 --> 00:12:53,966
噢, 吧嗒
你还有什么好说的?
Oh,snap. What else you got?

269
00:12:54,877 --> 00:12:57,275
好吧, 我扔了
正面还是反面?
Okay,I'm flipping. Heads or tails?

270
00:12:57,467 --> 00:12:59,817
- 你根本不需要两个房间
- 正面还是反面, Marshall
-You don't need two rooms. -Heads or tails,marshall.

271
00:12:59,864 --> 00:13:01,207
好像你需要两个房间似的
Like you need two rooms.

272
00:13:01,255 --> 00:13:02,933
我们可能很快会组建家庭
We might be starting a family soon. 

273
00:13:02,981 --> 00:13:03,844
噢, 不, 你不会
Oh,no,you're not.

274
00:13:03,892 --> 00:13:05,523
你还在念法学院的时候
怎么可能会要小孩
There's no way you're having a baby while you're still in law school.

275
00:13:05,571 --> 00:13:06,530
至少得三年后
It's going to be at least three years.

276
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:09,071
可能更快我们并没有
很认真的避孕
It could be sooner. We're not that careful with our birth control.

277
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:10,462
第二次反驳
Two-zip. 

278
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:13,387
噢, 拜托! 你清楚的很
要是我搬走，那间房会空出来
Oh,come on! You know damn well,I move out,that room's going unused.

279
00:13:13,435 --> 00:13:16,408
噢, 假设你找到新的室友
应该会是, Barney?
Oh,and I suppose you'll get a new roommate. who's it going to be,barney?

280
00:13:16,456 --> 00:13:18,374
你知道他做饭时是裸体
You know he cooks naked.

281
00:13:18,614 --> 00:13:21,491
但至少Barney不会把剑取下来
Yeah,well,at least barney wouldn't take the swords down. 

282
00:13:21,587 --> 00:13:23,025
我们是兄弟!
We were bros!

283
00:13:23,073 --> 00:13:24,943
这两把剑代表我们的兄弟情
These swords represent our bro-hood.

284
00:13:24,991 --> 00:13:27,581
但你却想把它换上
你的未婚妻的蠢画?
And you took them down to make room for your fiancee's stupid painting?

285
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:31,081
我未婚妻? 怎么突然
称呼她为未婚妻了?
My fiancee? Suddenly she's "my fiancee"?

286
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:32,472
Lily是我的一部分
Lily's a part of who I am.

287
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,109
如果我们是兄弟
她也就是你的一部分
Anif you're such a bro,she's a part of who you are,too.

288
00:13:35,157 --> 00:13:36,979
她是兄弟的一部分
She's a bro by extension.

289
00:13:37,075 --> 00:13:39,713
这公寓是我应得的
Marshall
I deserve this apartment,marsall.

290
00:13:40,096 --> 00:13:42,254
没有我应该
No more than I do. 

291
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:45,707
好 那我们扔硬币吧
Great. So let's flip for it. 

292
00:13:46,138 --> 00:13:47,289
扔吧!
Flip it. !

293
00:13:53,997 --> 00:13:55,724
所以，这就是我们决定谁得到公寓的方法?
So, is this how we're deciding who gets the apartment?

294
00:13:55,771 --> 00:13:57,498
我也这样想
I guess so. 

295
00:13:57,738 --> 00:13:59,128
我们要怎么决定?
How are we doing this exactly?

296
00:13:59,176 --> 00:14:00,663
就这样, 打到死?
Is this,like,to the death?

297
00:14:00,711 --> 00:14:02,916
我们得算出来
We shod probably figure that out. 

298
00:14:03,396 --> 00:14:05,170
他没事, 他没事
He's okay,he's okay.

299
00:14:06,417 --> 00:14:07,424
我能说点什么吗?
Can I observe something?

300
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,054
这很棒不是吗?
That this is kind of awesome?

301
00:14:09,486 --> 00:14:10,637
是的
Totally.

302
00:14:10,732 --> 00:14:13,226
- 我们怎么不早这样呢
- 我知道
-I can't believe we didn't do this before. -I know.

303
00:14:15,672 --> 00:14:16,726
谢谢
Thank you. 

304
00:14:18,501 --> 00:14:19,604
我不敢相信
I can't believe this.

305
00:14:19,652 --> 00:14:24,543
我和一位刚认识的美丽女士
在我最喜欢的餐厅用餐
I'm sitting here with a beautiful woman I just met eating at my favorite restaurant.

306
00:14:24,591 --> 00:14:26,125
很甜蜜
Sweet.

307
00:14:26,317 --> 00:14:27,947
这是个好地方
It's a nice place.

308
00:14:27,995 --> 00:14:30,345
很高兴知道未来也有排骨
It's good to know the future has ribs.

309
00:14:30,393 --> 00:14:34,708
在未来, 食物很可能
是装在雷管里的
In the future,food will most likely be served in gel cap form.

310
00:14:34,756 --> 00:14:37,394
另外, 那时候奶牛
可能已经灭绝了
Plus,cows will probably have died out by then.

311
00:14:37,873 --> 00:14:40,175
或者成为我们的统治者
Or be our leaders.

312
00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:45,546
- 你好
- 嘿嘿嘿嘿
-Hello. -H-h-h-h-hey.

313
00:14:45,642 --> 00:14:46,936
时间到了, Scherbotsky
Time's running out,scherbotsky.

314
00:14:46,984 --> 00:14:48,471
最后一次使用质量法的机会
Last cnce for the lemon law.

315
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:52,067
- 别烦我
- 4:56, 4:57, 4:58...
-Leave me alone. -4:56,4:57,4:58...

316
00:14:52,115 --> 00:14:54,033
我们才刚开始了解对方
we're only just getting to know each other.

317
00:14:54,081 --> 00:14:55,903
说我是对的
这些就能结束啦
Say I'm right and this could all be over.

318
00:14:55,951 --> 00:14:59,020
这可以成为医院
来的紧急电话
This could be your call from the hospital.

319
00:15:00,171 --> 00:15:04,151
让我猜猜，有个疯狂的事故
导致你必须离开
let me guess-- there's been a crazy accident and you have to go. 

320
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:06,117
不, 我绝对不会那样做
No,I would never do that.

321
00:15:06,165 --> 00:15:07,652
我哪也不想去
I don't want to go anywhere.

322
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:09,809
我是你的了
I'm all yours.

323
00:15:10,241 --> 00:15:14,221
听着, 如果你是妓女
我没那么多钱...
Look,if you're a hooker,I don't have a lot of money... 

324
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,441
- 噢, 这太棒了
- 我知道
-oh,that was awesome. -I know.

325
00:15:18,489 --> 00:15:19,640
再来一次
Do it again. 

326
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:23,284
好吧 但这次你跳起来
我袭击你的腿
Okay. But this time jump up and I'll swipe your legs.

327
00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:32,970
听着... 你知道为什么
我得拥有这地方？
look... here's why I should get the place.

328
00:15:33,018 --> 00:15:35,128
你和Lily, 你们要结婚的
You and lily,you get to be married.

329
00:15:35,176 --> 00:15:36,183
我得到什么呢, 是不?
What do I get,right?

330
00:15:36,231 --> 00:15:39,588
我没人结婚, 孤单一人
少了两个室友
I get to be unmarried,alone,minus two roommates.

331
00:15:39,636 --> 00:15:41,410
重点是, 我会无家可归
And on top of that,I have to be homeless. 

332
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:42,321
这公平吗?
Does that seem fair? 

333
00:15:42,369 --> 00:15:44,047
噢, 想的美
Oh,boo-freakin'-hoo. 

334
00:15:44,095 --> 00:15:45,054
什么?!
What?! 

335
00:15:45,102 --> 00:15:46,061
我呢
Woe is me.

336
00:15:46,109 --> 00:15:48,890
"我还没有结婚
我的卵巢在萎缩"
"I'm not married yet. My ovaries are shrinking."

337
00:15:48,938 --> 00:15:52,199
Ted! 如果你现在想结婚
你可能结的, 但是你不想
Ted! If you wanted to be married by now,you would be,but you're not.

338
00:15:52,247 --> 00:15:54,740
你知道为什么吗?
因为你太吹毛求疵啦
And you know why? Because you're irrationally picky.

339
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:57,713
你太容易分心
和失去兴趣啦
You're easily distracted and you're utterly anhedonic.

340
00:15:57,761 --> 00:15:59,344
- 失去兴趣?
- 失去兴趣
-"Anhedonic"? -Anhedonic.

341
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:00,974
我的意思你不能享受事情
It means you can't enjoy anytng.

342
00:16:01,022 --> 00:16:02,029
我不能吗
The hell I can't.

343
00:16:02,077 --> 00:16:05,098
- 我在享受这个
- 我知道 这些规则!
-I'm enjoying this. -I know. This rules! 

344
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,948
我很抱歉我把剑拿下来了
I'm sorry I took those swords down.

345
00:16:10,996 --> 00:16:11,955
伙计, 没事
Dude,that's okay.

346
00:16:12,003 --> 00:16:14,161
这让我们能玩剑击
不是吗?
It lead to this totally rad swordfight,didn't it? 

347
00:16:14,209 --> 00:16:15,264
是啊, 确实
Yeah,it did.

348
00:16:18,956 --> 00:16:20,730
你记得我们刚得到这两把剑的时候吗?
you remember when we first got these swords?

349
00:16:20,778 --> 00:16:22,457
是我们搬进来的那天
It was the day we moved in.

350
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,053
恭喜, Marshall, 我们住在
一个墙上有挂剑的公寓
Congratulations,marshall,we live in an apartment with swords on the wall.

351
00:16:26,101 --> 00:16:29,218
单子上的梦想
现在实现一半啦
List of lifelong dreams,you're now half as long.

352
00:16:29,314 --> 00:16:31,807
糟糕, 我弄掉了
这桌子的一个螺丝钉
Crap,I'm missing one of the screws for this table.

353
00:16:31,855 --> 00:16:33,054
用胶粘吧
Just use this wood glue.

354
00:16:33,102 --> 00:16:35,260
粘的住
It'll hold. 

355
00:16:43,051 --> 00:16:45,305
噢天那, 我马上去
Oh god, I'll be right there.

356
00:16:45,353 --> 00:16:47,319
Kevin, 我很抱歉 我得走了
Kevin,I'm so sorry. I have to go.

357
00:16:47,338 --> 00:16:50,148
我的朋友被剑刺伤了
My friend's been stabbed with a sword.

358
00:16:50,244 --> 00:16:53,313
Hab slosi' quch!
Hab slosi' quch! 

359
00:16:53,744 --> 00:16:56,477
这样很不礼貌 你不尊重我
It's a klingon insult. You have no honor.

360
00:16:56,525 --> 00:16:59,211
你知道, 如果你觉得要走
你可以坦诚相对
You know,if you felt this way,you could've just been upfront.

361
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:01,791
不, 我发誓, 这是真的 我...
No,I swear,that was a real call. I just...

362
00:17:02,117 --> 00:17:03,920
噢, 算了
oh,forget it.

363
00:17:06,691 --> 00:17:08,897
我刺伤了Lily
I stabbed lily.

364
00:17:08,993 --> 00:17:11,966
我刺伤了我的未婚妻
I stabbed my fiancee.

365
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,836
别这样, Marshall
Come on,marshall,

366
00:17:13,884 --> 00:17:16,665
你真觉得她还是
你的未婚妻吗?
do you really think she's still your fiancee?

367
00:17:17,385 --> 00:17:19,303
我开玩笑的
I'm kidding.

368
00:17:20,214 --> 00:17:22,803
嘿, 我认为你们
应该得到公寓
Hey,I think you guys should have the apartment.

369
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:25,488
但是你如此勇敢的为它而战
But you fought so bravely for it.

370
00:17:25,536 --> 00:17:28,893
我不是为公寓, 我是为...
I wasn't fighting for the apartment,I was fighting for... 

371
00:17:28,941 --> 00:17:33,017
我不知道... 为了让
所有的东西保持原状
I don't know... for everything to stay the way it is.

372
00:17:33,065 --> 00:17:35,271
但是我不用得到它, 那么...
But I'm not going to get that,so... 

373
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:37,908
认真的, 收下吧, 是你们的了
seriously,take the place,it's yours.

374
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,634
她还好吧?
Is she okay? 

375
00:17:39,682 --> 00:17:41,169
医生在给她包扎 她会没事的
They're just patching her up. She's going to be fine.

376
00:17:41,217 --> 00:17:44,621
那么听好 我正要和
这女孩约会, Jackie...
So get this: I was on a date with this girl,jackie... 

377
00:17:45,101 --> 00:17:47,019
怎么? 你们说她不错啊
what? You said she's fine.

378
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:49,369
那么无论如何
我和这女孩在约会, Jackie...
So anyway,I was on a date with this girl,jackie... wow,jackie,you make a really great first impression.

379
00:17:49,512 --> 00:17:52,246
哇, Jackie, 你给
我很好的第一印象
wow,jackie,ou make a really great first impression.

380
00:17:52,294 --> 00:17:56,130
我觉得今晚你的结束语
会是...
I have a feeling that tonight you might end up being jackie...

381
00:17:59,918 --> 00:18:04,186
嗯 很抱歉, 我得用
质量法来评判你
Yeah. I'm sorry,I'm going to have to lemon law you.

382
00:18:04,378 --> 00:18:06,296
已经传播出去了
这会实现的
It's out there. It's a thing.

383
00:18:06,344 --> 00:18:08,118
质量法是伟大的发明!
The lemon law is a thing!

384
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,132
该死, 我应该叫它Barney法
Damn,I should've called it barney's law.

385
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:13,584
- 但你完全...
- 让他沉醉下吧
-But you totally... -just let him have this one.

386
00:18:14,687 --> 00:18:15,742
好了
All set.

387
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:20,633
她说她想见质量不合格的
“圆桌”骑士
She said she'd like to see the knights of the poorly constructed roundtable?

388
00:18:21,736 --> 00:18:23,654
是我们
That's us. 

389
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:27,107
剑击?
A swordfight?

390
00:18:27,155 --> 00:18:28,929
抱歉, Lily
Sorry,lily.

391
00:18:29,265 --> 00:18:32,142
星期一, 我要去教导我班上的
On monday,I'm going to have to tell my kindergarten class,

392
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,491
小朋友不要拿着利器跑
who I teach not to run with scissors,

393
00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:38,999
我的未婚夫就是这样刺穿我的
that my fiancee ran me through with a frickin' broadsword.

394
00:18:39,143 --> 00:18:42,691
嗯, 公平的说
并没有把东西刺穿
Well,just to be fair,it didn't go all the way through.

395
00:18:42,835 --> 00:18:48,685
我很抱歉, 现在是在讨论
你刺伤我的程度吗?
I'm sorry,is this a discussion of the degree to which you stabbed me?

396
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:50,172
你是对的
You're right.

397
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,466
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

398
00:18:51,754 --> 00:18:55,590
我们在为谁能拥有
这间公寓而战, 我赢了
We were fighting to see who gets the apartment,and I won.

399
00:18:55,686 --> 00:18:57,077
呃, 你没有
Uh,you didn't win.

400
00:18:57,173 --> 00:18:58,851
我... 呃... ... 把它让给你的
I... uh... ...gave it to you.

401
00:18:58,899 --> 00:19:00,242
- 你知道吗...?
- 等等, 等等
-You know what...? -Wait,wait,wait.

402
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:02,399
我并不想要那公寓
I don't want that apartment.

403
00:19:02,447 --> 00:19:03,886
那是男孩子住的
It's a boy apartment.

404
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:08,345
那里...
充满着剑和电子游戏还有...
It's... full of swords and video games and... 

405
00:19:08,393 --> 00:19:10,983
闻起来象男生的味道
kind of smells like dude.

406
00:19:12,709 --> 00:19:15,922
我的意思是, 现在住那很好
但是我们结婚后
I mean,it's fine for now,but when we get married,

407
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:20,717
我想和你开辟新的生活
……在新的地方
I want to start a new life with you... in a new place.

408
00:19:21,868 --> 00:19:24,170
会想念老地方的
Gonna miss the old place.

409
00:19:24,218 --> 00:19:26,184
我也会
I will,too.

410
00:19:26,423 --> 00:19:28,437
但是我们大概一年内
都不会结婚
But we're not going to get married for,like,a year.

411
00:19:28,485 --> 00:19:30,595
是啊, 那是未来的
Marshall的问题
Yeah,that's future marshall's problem.

412
00:19:30,643 --> 00:19:32,226
让他去处理那些吧
Let that guy deal with it.

413
00:19:32,274 --> 00:19:33,856
是啊
Totally.

414
00:19:33,952 --> 00:19:37,980
可能是失血过多
的原因, 我饿了
Maybe it's the massive blood loss talking,but I'm starving.

415
00:19:38,028 --> 00:19:39,946
我们去吃东西吧
Let's go get some dinner.

416
00:19:39,994 --> 00:19:42,008
我知道个地方
I know just the place.

417
00:19:43,255 --> 00:19:45,269
中国餐厅 我还是不敢相信
Chinese restaurant. I still don't believe it.

418
00:19:45,316 --> 00:19:46,803
我就说吧
I told you.

419
00:19:49,249 --> 00:19:51,742
嘿, 干杯 生活是多变的
Hey,a toast. Life is full of changes.

420
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:55,482
某天你有间公寓, 下一天
可能就变成卖饺子的了
One day you have an apartment,the next day it's a house of dumplings.

421
00:19:55,722 --> 00:19:58,072
但是重要的东西不会改变
But the important stuff doesn't change. 

422
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,558
为重要的东西而干
To the important stuff.

423
00:19:59,606 --> 00:20:01,860
干杯
Here,here. Cheers. Cheers.

424
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,305
为质量法而干
And to the lemon law.

425
00:20:05,456 --> 00:20:07,278
自己和自己干
Self click.

426
00:20:07,326 --> 00:20:09,628
还有, 这是我买的杯子
And by the way,I bought these glasses.

427
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:11,450
在宜家买的
Bought them at ikea.

428
00:20:11,498 --> 00:20:13,225
这些是我的杯子!
These are my glasses!

429
00:20:13,464 --> 00:20:16,341
我喜欢这首歌
好久没听过了
I love this song. I haven't heard this in forever.

430
00:20:16,389 --> 00:20:19,890
这是你大二时候
给我做的混合磁带
And I'm pretty sure this is a mix tape you made me in sophomore year.

431
00:20:19,938 --> 00:20:20,897
对, 是哦
Yeah,right.

432
00:20:20,993 --> 00:20:24,493
Lily, 你的公寓有
最好的上海饺子
Lily,your apartment makes the best shanghai dumplings.

433
00:20:25,596 --> 00:20:30,152
我爱你, Lily派
1998年情人节快乐
I love you,lily pad. Happy valentine's day 1998.

434
