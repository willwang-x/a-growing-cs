老爸老妈罗曼史

How.I.Met.Your.Mother
Season 1 Episode 19

4
00:00:12,603 --> 00:00:14,856
[三个月前]
你们知道她最喜欢Otis Redding
合集中的哪张CD吗?
[three month earlier]
Her favorite CD in the Otis Redding box set?

5
00:00:15,077 --> 00:00:15,969
第三碟
Disc three.

6
00:00:16,094 --> 00:00:17,043
我最喜欢的呢?
My favorite?

7
00:00:17,244 --> 00:00:18,788
有人能猜到吗?有人吗? 加油
Any guesses? Anyone? Come on.

8
00:00:19,508 --> 00:00:20,361
第三碟!
Disc three!

9
00:00:21,177 --> 00:00:23,891
天,Victoria太棒了! 我可以几个小时都说她
God,Victoria's so amazing! I could talk about her for hours.

10
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:25,137
你说“可以”是什么意思?
What do you mean "could"?

11
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:29,875
对不起 只是... 天,我... 我很为这个女孩着迷
I'm sorry,it's just... God,I... I'm crazy about this girl.

12
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,771
我觉得也许... 我不想这么说
It feels like maybe... I don't want to say it.

13
00:00:32,867 --> 00:00:34,507
相信这种冲动,Ted
Trust that impulse,Ted.

14
00:00:35,917 --> 00:00:38,631
嘿 刚发生了件很酷的事情
Hey. Something kinda cool just happened.

15
00:00:38,737 --> 00:00:40,501
我的小菜故事 - 狗狗唱歌
My story on Pickles - the Singing Dog

16
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:43,551
刚得到了本地年度传媒奖的题名
just got nominated for a Local Area Media Award.

17
00:00:44,107 --> 00:00:45,421
一个LAME-A题名（本地年度传媒奖缩写）?
a LAME-A?

18
00:00:46,121 --> 00:00:48,605
我们更喜欢叫它“本地年度传媒奖”
We prefer Local Area Media Award.

19
00:00:49,161 --> 00:00:51,079
嗯... 会举行一个大型宴会
Um... there's going to be this big banquet.

20
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:55,309
我知道这事不是很有意思,但是如果你们能来对我来说是很重要的
I know these things aren't much fun,but it would really mean a lot to me if you guys came.

21
00:00:56,555 --> 00:00:57,515
而且有开放的酒吧
And there's an open bar.

22
00:00:57,649 --> 00:00:59,260
- 好! 
- 说定了!
- Yes! 
- Word up!

23
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,603
好，我要两个人的位子
Yeah,put me down for two.

24
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,108
真的吗? 还有三个月呢
Really? It's three months away.

25
00:01:02,252 --> 00:01:05,944
我知道,但是... 伙计们,抱歉,我要说
I know,but... guys,I'm sorry,I'm going to say it.

26
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,129
我有种感觉  ,Victoria会长时间在我们身边的
I have a feeling Victoria's going to be around for a long time.

27
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:10,500
三个月后
three months later

28
00:01:10,644 --> 00:01:12,245
我会想Victoria
I'm gonna miss Victoria.

29
00:01:12,734 --> 00:01:17,136
我就别去了 ,Robin还在生我的气... 你们知道
I should just skip this thing entirely. Robin's still pissed at me after... you know.

30
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:23,850
你说谎和Victoria分手了其实还没有
因为你想上Robin 却一夜伤了两个女孩的心
同时失去了她们?
You lied and said you were broken up with Victoria before you actually were so you could try to nail Robin and you wound up losing both girls in one night?

31
00:01:24,636 --> 00:01:27,091
对 ,我说“你们知道”是这个意思
Yes,that's what I meant by "you know."

32
00:01:27,974 --> 00:01:30,630
我三个星期都没见她了 ,她也不回我电话
I haven't seen her in three weeks. She won't return my calls.

33
00:01:30,736 --> 00:01:32,050
瞧 ,我不该去
Look,I shouldn't go.

34
00:01:32,145 --> 00:01:33,517
你绝对应该去
You should definitely go.

35
00:01:33,651 --> 00:01:36,471
瞧 这是表明你还是她的朋友而且你支持她的机会
Look,it's a chance to show her you're still friends and that you support her.

36
00:01:36,567 --> 00:01:39,684
或者你可以带个更漂亮的女朋友去让她难受
Or it's a chance to mess with her head by showing up with someone hotter.

37
00:01:39,722 --> 00:01:43,021
还能更棒，三重威胁：更漂亮、胸部更大
Even better,triple threat: hotter and bigger boobs.

38
00:01:43,117 --> 00:01:44,623
- 这才两个 
- 再数一遍
- That's only two. 
- Count again.

39
00:01:45,908 --> 00:01:49,370
Barney我不会带女朋友的,就算我愿意,现在也只剩下两小时了
Barney,I'm not bringing a date. Even if I wanted to,the thing's in two hours.

40
00:01:49,504 --> 00:01:50,521
那么找个“伴儿”啊
So get an escort.

41
00:01:50,626 --> 00:01:52,717
你说的“伴儿”是妓女的意思?
By "escort" you mean prostitute?

42
00:01:52,918 --> 00:01:53,733
为什么不呢?
Why not?

43
00:01:53,868 --> 00:01:55,278
因为......不雅?
Because... gross?

44
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:59,843
哦,不雅,怎么，你对卖淫有道德障碍?
Oh,gross. What,you have some puritanical hang-up about prostitution?

45
00:01:59,948 --> 00:02:02,892
伙计 这是世界上最古老的职业
Dude,it's the world's oldest profession.

46
00:02:03,285 --> 00:02:04,762
你真认为这是事实?
You really think that's true?

47
00:02:04,897 --> 00:02:10,229
哦 是的 ,我打赌甚至Cro-Magnons也找妓女,和鱼一起卖
Oh,yeah. I bet even Cro-Magnons used to give cave hookers, like,an extra fish for putting out.

48
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:12,540
啊哈,那最古老的职业应该是渔夫
Aha,so then the oldest profession would be fishermen.

49
00:02:12,636 --> 00:02:14,439
Kaboom! 我是律师
Kaboom! You've been lawyered.

50
00:02:16,271 --> 00:02:19,186
来吧,Ted我们给你找个妓女,会很有意思的
Come on,Ted,let's get you a hooker. It'll be fun.

51
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:23,771
带她去宴会，讽刺的和她装成一对,还是真的和她上床?
Okay,to bring to the banquet and hang out with ironically or to actually have sex with?

52
00:02:24,365 --> 00:02:25,200
对
Yes.

53
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:30,081
不，这是非法的,而且我有提过这不雅吗?
No! It's illegal. And did I mention gross?

54
00:02:30,206 --> 00:02:32,805
好可爱,Ted你真是个乡下佬 
That's adorable. Ted, you're such a hayseed.

55
00:02:33,102 --> 00:02:37,130
色情业是20世纪最成熟的工业
The companionship business is the growth industry of the 21st century.

56
00:02:37,264 --> 00:02:41,695
你要知道每八个成年美国女人中就有一个是妓女
You do realize that one out of every eight adult women in America is a prostitute.

57
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:42,942
- 你自己编的 
- 撤销
- You just made that up. 
- Withdrawn.

58
00:02:43,076 --> 00:02:43,930
我是律师
Lawyered.

59
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:47,986
关键是 你有多久没做爱了?
The point is,how long has it been?

60
00:02:50,605 --> 00:02:51,957
57天
57 days.

61
00:02:52,897 --> 00:02:54,383
- 这是你的水吗? 我可以……? 
- 嗯，喝吧
- Is that your water? May I? 
- Yeah,go ahead.

62
00:02:56,589 --> 00:02:58,382
57天?!
57 days?!

63
00:02:59,073 --> 00:03:00,732
Ted,你阳痿.
Ted,you are in a slump.

64
00:03:00,828 --> 00:03:02,439
不，我没有阳痿
No,it's not a slump.

65
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,549
这是有意识的摆脱女孩
It's an intentional hiatus from girls.

66
00:03:04,645 --> 00:03:07,397
阳痿的人一接近目标就退却了
A slump is when you strike out every time you step up to the plate.

67
00:03:07,532 --> 00:03:09,315
但我不在花名册上,宝贝
But I'm off the roster,baby.

68
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:11,205
我在更衣室里,坐在混乱中
I'm in the locker room sitting in the whirlpool.

69
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:13,612
而且我告诉你 这感觉棒极了
And I'll tell you something,it feels pretty good.

70
00:03:13,813 --> 00:03:15,674
对，你知道那间更衣室还有什么吗?
Yeah,you know what else is in that locker room?

71
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,966
一群悬着脑袋的裸体男人
A bunch of naked dudes hanging brain.

72
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:21,255
Ted,你需要一个女人
Ted,you need a lady.

73
00:03:21,361 --> 00:03:23,979
而且我有个约会的好人选-- Mary
And I've got the next best thing-- Mary.

74
00:03:24,075 --> 00:03:25,351
她住在我那幢楼里
She lives in my building.

75
00:03:25,485 --> 00:03:27,652
她漂亮聪明而且非常酷
She's smart,she's hot,she's totally cool.

76
00:03:27,748 --> 00:03:28,995
哦 她听起来不错
Oh,she sounds great.

77
00:03:29,091 --> 00:03:31,421
谁知道呢,也许有一天我们能结婚
And who knows? Maybe we'll wind up getting married someday.

78
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:33,924
你知道，如果能得到给她拉皮条老兄的祝福的话
You know,if we can get a blessing from her pimp.

79
00:03:34,538 --> 00:03:39,295
你想只凭一个人的表面的特征去判断他?
You want to judge a fellow human being based solely on one external characteristic?

80
00:03:39,391 --> 00:03:41,021
那是歧视.
That's racism.

81
00:03:41,194 --> 00:03:43,265
而我不会搞歧视的人一起喝酒
And I do not drink with racists.

82
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,579
祝你一天愉快
Good day.

83
00:03:48,732 --> 00:03:50,439
你只是等有人开口 你就可以...
You're just waiting for me to speak,so you can...

84
00:03:50,545 --> 00:03:52,885
我说了祝你一天愉快!
I said good day!

85
00:03:54,266 --> 00:03:56,452
我应该把头发扎起来还是放下来?
So should I wear my hair up or down?

86
00:03:58,974 --> 00:03:59,828
Lily.
Lily.

87
00:04:00,068 --> 00:04:00,960
什么?
What?

88
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:03,846
- 你怎么了? 
- 哦 没事 对不起
- You okay? 
- Oh,yeah,sorry.

89
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,158
我只是工作太累了
I'm just exhausted from work.

90
00:04:06,292 --> 00:04:09,725
愚蠢的校董会取消了我们幼儿园孩子午睡的时间
The stupid school board took away nap time in all kindergarten classes

91
00:04:09,831 --> 00:04:13,303
现在一天过完的时候孩子们都疯了
and now the kids are just going crazy by the end of the day.

92
00:04:13,437 --> 00:04:17,436
而且因为我也不能午睡了,所以处理起来更难了
It's much harder to deal with because,well,I don't get my nap.

93
00:04:17,992 --> 00:04:19,891
等等，你是说孩子们睡觉的时候你也睡?
Wait,you were taking naps when the kids were?

94
00:04:19,987 --> 00:04:21,071
这安全吗?
Is that safe?

95
00:04:21,301 --> 00:04:23,660
他们才五岁,能对我做什么?
Well,they're only five. What are they gonna do to me?

96
00:04:26,441 --> 00:04:28,283
Ted还是会去,对吗?
Ted's still coming to this thing,right?

97
00:04:28,407 --> 00:04:29,127
对
Yep.

98
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:34,584
你认为,嗯...假设我带个男人去会奇怪吗?
Do  you think,um... hypothetically... it would be weird if I bring a date?

99
00:04:34,948 --> 00:04:38,861
瞧瞧你 ,Scherbotsky,显然想让Ted忌妒
Look at you,Scherbotsky,blatantly trying to make Ted jealous.

100
00:04:38,986 --> 00:04:41,220
不 只是台里的一个人
No,it's just this guy at the station.

101
00:04:41,345 --> 00:04:44,817
我从不和同事交往,是他问了我,我同意了会奇怪吗
I never get involved with co-workers,but he asked me and I said yes.

102
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:46,265
会奇怪吗?
Is it going to be weird?

103
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:48,461
不 一点也不会奇怪
No,it's not going to be weird at all.

104
00:04:48,682 --> 00:04:50,321
Robin要带男人去
Robin's bringing a date.

105
00:04:50,398 --> 00:04:52,163
天啊，会很奇怪的
Boy. That's going to be really weird.

106
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,573
我知道
I know.

107
00:04:55,922 --> 00:04:57,428
Robin要带男人去
Robin's bringing a date.

108
00:04:57,562 --> 00:04:59,854
哦 好啊 不奇怪
Oh. Okay. That's not weird.

109
00:04:59,989 --> 00:05:02,377
她带男朋友.我很高兴她重新开始了
She's bringing a date. I'm glad she's moving on.

110
00:05:02,482 --> 00:05:05,359
- 伙计,会很奇怪的 
- 不,没关系
- Dude,it's going to be weird. 
- No,it's fine.

111
00:05:05,532 --> 00:05:08,534
瞧，不管我们之间发生了什么,Robin和我还是朋友
Look,in spite of whatever happened between us,Robin and I are still friends.

112
00:05:08,678 --> 00:05:09,589
我不认为会奇怪
I don't think it'll be weird.

113
00:05:09,713 --> 00:05:11,257
- 对 不会奇怪的
- 谢谢
- Yeah,it won't be weird. 
- Thank you.

114
00:05:11,363 --> 00:05:13,482
因为你也要带女朋友
Because you're going to bring your own date.

115
00:05:13,712 --> 00:05:15,909
- 你好,Barney.
- 嗨,Mary.
- Hello,Barney. 
- Hi,Mary.

116
00:05:16,014 --> 00:05:18,153
你见过Ted吗?
Have you met Ted?

117
00:05:21,837 --> 00:05:22,959
很高兴认识你Ted
Nice to meet you Ted.

118
00:05:23,093 --> 00:05:24,464
嗨,Mary.
Hi,Mary.

119
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:26,852
哇 我也很高兴认识你
Wow. It's,uh,nice to meet you,too.

120
00:05:26,996 --> 00:05:28,262
那么我们去颁奖礼吗?
So we're going to an award show?

121
00:05:28,396 --> 00:05:30,008
嗯,对,请原谅 等一等?
Uh,yeah,will you just excuse us for one minute?

122
00:05:30,142 --> 00:05:30,995
Barney.
Barney.

123
00:05:31,187 --> 00:05:32,070
一会见,Mare
See you in two shakes,Mare.

124
00:05:32,204 --> 00:05:34,496
你们俩随便玩
You two make yourselves comfortable.

125
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:36,865
见鬼 怎么回事?
What the hell?

126
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:41,257
伙计，你对色情行业狭窄的观点让我很气愤
Dude,your narrow-minded views on professional fornicators were harshing my mellow.

127
00:05:41,391 --> 00:05:42,907
所以我给你的晚上找了个伴
So I got you a date for the evening.

128
00:05:43,003 --> 00:05:44,902
你给我找了个妓女

134
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,901
认识到妓女也是人.
you'll come to see that courtesans are people,too.

135
00:05:59,997 --> 00:06:04,197
D:你可以做B整夜.

136
00:06:04,226 --> 00:06:06,720
我不会带妓女去Robin的宴会的.
I'm not taking a prostitute to Robin's banquet.

137
00:06:06,844 --> 00:06:08,743
只有我、你和Marshell知道.
The only people who will know are you,me and Marshall.

没人会怀疑
No one will suspect a thing.

139

They'll just see you with this unbelievably smoking hot girl and...

140
00:06:13,078 --> 00:06:15,533
哦 好吧 这是有点可疑.
Okay,that's a little bit suspicious.

141
00:06:17,202 --> 00:06:20,223
瞧，我只是想在今晚扩展一下你的界线
Look,I'm just trying to expand your horizons a little bit tonight.

但如果你没兴趣,没关系,我只是浪费了500美元,没什么
But if you're not interested,fine,I'm out 500 bucks. Whatever.

143
00:06:23,522 --> 00:06:24,635
500美元?
500 bucks?

144
00:06:24,932 --> 00:06:26,869
Ted你是我兄弟
Ted,you're my cabron.

145
00:06:27,032 --> 00:06:30,370
你以为我会在港务局给你找个没牙的吗?
You think I'm gonna stick you with some toothless tranny from the Port Authority?

146
00:06:31,262 --> 00:06:34,647
瞧瞧她多辣.Robin会忌妒死的.
Look at how hot she is. Robin would be so jealous.

147
00:06:34,781 --> 00:06:37,630
我不是想让Robin忌妒,Barney.
I'm not trying to make Robin jealous,Barney.

148
00:06:37,725 --> 00:06:41,916
瞧,我... 告诉Marry谢谢,但是不用了,谢谢,我是有灵魂的人
Look,I... tell Mary,thanks. but no thanks. I have a soul.

149
00:06:42,281 --> 00:06:47,153
然后我和Marshell叔叔开始了一段我们最有名的心电交流
And then your Uncle Marhsall and I had one of our famous telepathic conversations.

150
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:48,591
瞧Robin的男朋友
Check out Robin's date.

151

157

He was best known for his morning segment "In Today's Paper,"

159
00:07:06,046 --> 00:07:08,798
他把当天的报纸找来逐字逐句的

160
00:07:08,865 --> 00:07:10,151
给观众读一遍

看起来挺有意思

164
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,229

165
00:07:24,364 --> 00:07:25,936

I can't believe I'm on a date with a hooker.

197
00:09:01,147 --> 00:09:04,686
对，我不敢相信你让她和lily一起去了洗手间，伙计
Yeah,I can't believe you let her and Lily go to the ladies' room together,man.

198
00:09:04,781 --> 00:09:06,095
她们会在那说自己的秘密的

203
00:09:14,592 --> 00:09:15,801
不，没什么
No,not really.

204
00:09:16,626 --> 00:09:19,608
我们只是闲谈几句,我向她借了唇膏
We just chitchatted and I borrowed her lipstick.

205
00:09:21,565 --> 00:09:26,283
为什么吸血鬼lou会是星期六下午功夫片的主持人?
Why is Vampire Lou the host of a Saturday Afternoon Kung Fu Movie?

206
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:28,422
这一点道理都没有
You know,it just makes no sense.

207
00:09:28,566 --> 00:09:30,465
天 气死我了
God,that pisses me off.

208
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:31,846
lily你还好吗?
Lily,you okay?

209
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,250
哦，没事，我只是累了,我累的时候就变的不正常
Oh,yeah,I'm just tired. And when I get tired,I get cranky.

210
00:09:35,346 --> 00:09:37,389
真的？我可以想象你不正常的样子
Really? I couldn't imagine you cranky.

211
00:09:37,523 --> 00:09:40,237
"真的？我可以想象你不正常的样子"

213
00:09:44,112 --> 00:09:49,300
我是幼稚园老师,校董会取消了我的午睡时间――孩子们的午睡时间
Well,I teach kindergarten and the school board took away my nap time,the kids' nap time.

214
00:09:49,406 --> 00:09:50,518
lily 别干了
Lily,quit your job.

215
00:09:50,585 --> 00:09:52,810
去个私人学校工作,不用管校董会
Work at a private school. You won't have to deal with the school board,

216
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,527
而且你能挣更多钱
and you'll make a ton more money.

217
00:09:54,632 --> 00:09:55,649
知道吗 Barney ?
Well,guess what,Barney?

218
00:09:55,745 --> 00:09:59,121
我做人生重要决定时并不是根据挣钱的多少
I don't base all my life decisions on how much money I'm going to make,

219
00:09:59,226 --> 00:10:01,250
不像你 可悲的是 也不像我的未婚夫
unlike you and,sadly,my fiance.

220
00:10:01,355 --> 00:10:03,024
我只是在实习，积累经验
Well,it's just an internship,for the record.

221
00:10:03,101 --> 00:10:07,023
因为如果我为了钱而牺牲所以的价值观 
Yeah,because if I did sacrifice all my values just for an easy buck,

222
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,558
那我变成什么人了?
what would that make me?

223
00:10:09,085 --> 00:10:10,265

A prostitute.

You just insulted someone I hate by referencing something I love.

260
00:11:44,395 --> 00:11:47,281
见鬼 你变得更辣了
Damn,you just got even hotter.

261
00:11:49,736 --> 00:11:52,959
那晚后来我逐渐意识到
And so,as the night wore on,I started to realize,

262
00:11:53,093 --> 00:11:58,790
这个女孩，尽管是个妓女，但确实很棒
this girl,despite what she did for a living,was kind of great.

263
00:12:01,475 --> 00:12:02,942
- 嘿 
- 嘿
- Hey. 
- Hey.

264
00:12:03,211 --> 00:12:04,755
Mary看起来不错
Mary seems nice.

265
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,608
你吻过她了吗？
Have you kissed her yet

266
00:12:05,714 --> 00:12:09,214
还是要等到你和别人发展成为正式的情侣关系以后?
or are you waiting until you're in a serious relationship with someone else?

267
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,264
我，嗯...我要为发生的一切道歉
I,uh... I wanted to apologize for everything that happened.

268
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,067
- 就这样 
- 我们就没事了
- And just like that,
- it's all okay.

269
00:12:14,173 --> 00:12:15,017
滚动信用
Roll credits.

270
00:12:15,161 --> 00:12:17,865
那么你要永远生气下去吗?我们现在不是朋友了吗?
So you're going to be mad at me forever? What,we're not even friends now?

271
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:19,802
- 我们还是朋友 
- 是吗?
- We're still friends. 
- Are we?

272
00:12:19,898 --> 00:12:21,835
你不回我电话 我们不一起玩了
You don't return my calls,we never hang out

273
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:25,087
现在你想让我忌妒 就带一个白痴出现在我面前?
and now you're trying to make my jealous by waving Edward R. Moron in my face?

274
00:12:25,221 --> 00:12:29,028
哦，你找个穿夜总会礼服的金发助理律师不也是要让我忌妒吗?
Oh,and Paralegally Blonde isn't here in her low-cut dress to make me jealous?

275
00:12:29,153 --> 00:12:31,282
哦，那么你是说她是妓女?
Oh,so now she's a whore?

276
00:12:32,231 --> 00:12:33,018
什么?
What?

277
00:12:33,143 --> 00:12:36,355
你知道吗?助理律师Mary很棒
You know something? Mary the paralegal is awesome.

278
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,331
你要知道 我今天来不是要让你忌妒 
And you know what else? I didn't come here tonight to make you jealous,

279
00:12:38,465 --> 00:12:40,105
而是要像一个朋友那样支持你
I came here to support you as a friend.

280
00:12:40,239 --> 00:12:42,762
而老实说 我已经厌倦了这种尝试了
And frankly,I'm sick of trying.

281
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,509
我喜欢那人
I like that guy.

282
00:12:51,307 --> 00:12:52,947
- 嘿 
- 嘿

- Hey.

283
00:12:53,071 --> 00:12:54,491
你们在那谈什么?
What were you guys talking about over there?

284
00:12:54,596 --> 00:12:58,950
哦，我只是告诉我朋友 我觉得你很棒
Oh,I was,uh,just telling my friend that I think you're awesome.

285
00:12:59,468 --> 00:13:00,514
嗯，谢谢
Well,thanks.

286
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:04,474
你知道吗 这是我进过的最好的酒店
You know,this is one of the nicer hotels I've ever been in.

287
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,788
哦 我的朋友负责改造过这
Oh,yeah,my friend did the remodel.

288
00:13:05,884 --> 00:13:07,438
你应该看看这的客房 风景很漂亮
You should see the rooms. The views are amazing.

289
00:13:07,562 --> 00:13:11,034
是吗 也许我们没有房间太糟了
Yeah? Maybe it's too bad we don't have a room.

290
00:13:11,331 --> 00:13:14,180
1506房 我付钱 你们去疯吧 
Room 1506. My treat. You kids go nuts.

291
00:13:14,285 --> 00:13:16,021
事实上，不要用迷你条
Actually,don't use the mini-bar.

292
00:13:22,563 --> 00:13:24,519
去吧 拜托 Ted 去吧
Do it. Come on,Ted,do it.

293
00:13:24,644 --> 00:13:26,879
这是你30岁之前必须做的一件事
This is one of those things you have to do before you turn 30.

294
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:27,962
和妓女上床？
Sleep with a prostitute?

295
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:30,168
不 告别处男身
No,lose your virginity. What up.

296
00:13:30,302 --> 00:13:34,637
统计证明 和妓女至少一次有染的男人在今后的恋情中成功的几率

298
00:13:38,425 --> 00:13:39,078
你编的
You just made that up.

299
00:13:39,183 --> 00:13:40,861
- 撤销

二 你不该这么做

他还没有发现
And third,I've been placing small items in Sandy's hair all night. He still hasn't noticed.

我知道我不能这么做 我不会做的 
I know I can't do this. I'm not doing this.

那么你和他不是...?
So you and he aren't...?

349
00:16:09,743 --> 00:16:11,555
我不和同事约会
I don't date people I work with.

350
00:16:11,853 --> 00:16:13,876
我只是想让Ted忌妒
I was just trying to make Ted jealous.

351
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:14,883
他呢...?

而且，你知道吗，如果Ted喜欢她 她也许真的很酷
And,you know,if Ted likes her,she's probably pretty cool.

355
00:16:24,474 --> 00:16:26,919
Lily我知道你在睡觉 
Lily,I know you're asleep,

356
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:30,755
但我必须告诉某个人 我们不向对方隐瞒任何事情 
所以 我要说了 
but I have to tell someone this,and we tell each other everything. So,here it goes.

357
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,328
Mary不是助理律师 
Mary's not a paralegal.

358
00:16:32,731 --> 00:16:34,035
她是妓女
She's a prostitute.

359
00:16:34,169 --> 00:16:36,289
Mary是妓女?
Mary's a prostitute?

360
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:37,344
什么?!
What?!

361
00:16:37,507 --> 00:16:39,415
Barney付的钱
Barney paid for her.

362
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:40,816
真的吗?
Is that true?

363
00:16:41,113 --> 00:16:44,124
我们谈了关于嫖妓的事 
We were having a conversation about prostitution,

364
00:16:44,259 --> 00:16:46,934
然后Barney打了电话给她 她就出现在酒吧了 
and then Barney calls her up and then she shows up at the bar

365
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,814
而现在她和Ted在楼上了
and now she and Ted are upstairs.

366
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:51,202
哦 说真的 Ted最近到底是怎么回事?
Okay,seriously,what is going on with Ted lately?

367
00:16:51,298 --> 00:16:53,590
他精神出问题了吗?
Is he having a nervous breakdown?

368
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:57,666
你知道吗 Barney 对任何人来说这都是更深的新堕落
You know,Barney,for anyone else,this would be a new low,

369
00:16:57,771 --> 00:17:01,493
但对你来说只是新的中度堕落
but sadly,for you,it's just a new middle.

370
00:17:01,924 --> 00:17:05,003
哦 我的天 我用了她的唇膏 ! 噢!
Oh,my God,I used her lipstick! Ah!

371
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:06,537
那是她的餐巾
That's her napkin.

372
00:17:06,671 --> 00:17:07,659
不!
No!

373
00:17:09,126 --> 00:17:11,850
好，嗯，我想现在是最好的时机了
Okay,well,I guess now is as good a time as any.

374
00:17:11,984 --> 00:17:14,046
为了保持今晚的颁奖主题 
In keeping with tonight's award show motif,

375
00:17:14,181 --> 00:17:17,326
我想宣布本晚最曲折的结局!
I'd like to announce this evening's big twist ending!

376
00:17:20,347 --> 00:17:23,042
吸血鬼Lou,有幸请你宣布吗?
Vampire Lou,would you do the honors?

377
00:17:24,327 --> 00:17:27,310
"Mary不是真妓女"
"Mary's not really a prostitute."

378
00:17:27,732 --> 00:17:28,374
什么?
What?

379
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,273
就这样吸血鬼Lou. 干得好
That's all,Vampire Lou. Nicely done.

380
00:17:30,408 --> 00:17:31,654
- 那么她不是...? 
- 对
- So she's not...?  
- No.

381
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,918
Mary只是住在我那幢楼里的一个助理律师
Mary's just a paralegal who lives in my building.

382
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:35,826
哦-- 哈-哈!而且最有趣的是--
Oh-- ha-ha! And here's the best part--

383
00:17:35,941 --> 00:17:38,492
她不知道Ted以为她是妓女
she has no idea that Ted thinks she's a hooker.

384
00:17:40,947 --> 00:17:42,060
哦 拜托 
Oh,come on.

385
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,515
如果你们不笑 就好像太吝啬了
If you don't laugh,it just seems mean.

386
00:17:54,738 --> 00:17:56,829
我觉得自己是里查・基尔
I feel kind of like Richard Gere.

387
00:17:57,692 --> 00:18:01,778
- 不是对自己的样子害羞，对吗? 
- 对
- Not shy about your looks,are you? 
- No.

388
00:18:02,363 --> 00:18:05,163
你知道吗，Mary，我从来没这么做过
You know,Mary,I've never done this before.

389
00:18:05,355 --> 00:18:06,803
做什么?
Done what?

390
00:18:06,937 --> 00:18:11,291
你知道，“约会”
You know,been... on a "date."

391
00:18:11,905 --> 00:18:13,056
是的，对
Yeah,right.

392
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:14,993
等等，你是在开玩笑，对吗
Wait,you're kidding,right?

393
00:18:15,118 --> 00:18:16,365
不
No.

394
00:18:16,499 --> 00:18:18,101
怎么 这很奇怪吗?
Why,is that so odd?

395
00:18:18,235 --> 00:18:23,606
嗯，Ted，我的意思是，我15岁就开始和人约会了
Well,Ted,I mean,I've been going on dates since I was 15.

396
00:18:23,778 --> 00:18:25,418
天 你那时候还是个孩子啊
God,you were just a kid.

397
00:18:26,569 --> 00:18:29,647
嗯，瞧，我们先喝点酒 这样我们就能放松
Well,look,let's just have a few drinks. We'll relax and...

398
00:18:29,782 --> 00:18:34,826
好 听起来不错 我的客户整天骑在我身上
Yeah,that sounds great. I had clients riding me all day long.

399
00:18:35,124 --> 00:18:36,236
一定很难
Must be tough.

400
00:18:36,437 --> 00:18:38,730
对，我是说我有个客户就是不能放过我
Yeah. I mean,this one guy just wouldn't leave me alone.

401
00:18:38,864 --> 00:18:40,465
我的意思是，和我讨论肛门
I mean,talk about anal.

402
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,915
嗯，我们到了
Well,here we are.

403
00:18:52,482 --> 00:18:55,695
好吧 Mary 我很喜欢你
Okay,look,Mary,I like you a lot.

404
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:59,781
我这么喜欢你都让我有点吃惊了，但我不能这么做
I'm sort of amazed at how much I like you,but I can't do this.

405
00:18:59,876 --> 00:19:01,152
你是个妓女
You're a hooker.

406
00:19:02,466 --> 00:19:03,578
什么?
What?

407
00:19:03,837 --> 00:19:06,484
瞧，也许我太老土 但是对不起 这是违背我的原则的
Look,maybe I'm old-fashioned,but I'm sorry,that's a deal-breaker for me.

408
00:19:06,618 --> 00:19:08,585
我不会和妓女上床
I'm not going to have sex with a prostitute.

409
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,538
不... Ted 我是个助理律师
No... Ted,I'm a paralegal.

410
00:19:11,673 --> 00:19:13,313
拜托Mary,这里也没有别人 
Come on,Mary,there's no one else around.

411
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:14,540
你是个妓女
You're a hooker.

412
00:19:15,576 --> 00:19:16,880
不 Ted ...
No,Ted...

413
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,731
我是个助理律师
I'm a paralegal.

414
00:19:19,028 --> 00:19:21,944
不 你是个妓女
No,you're a hooker.

415
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:26,298
不 我是个助理律师
No,I'm a paralegal.

416
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,074
你是个助理律师
You're a paralegal.

417
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:36,627
这不好笑
That was not funny.

418
00:19:36,895 --> 00:19:38,113
不好笑 伙计
Not funny,dude.

419
00:19:38,267 --> 00:19:40,434
我知道，这是场闹剧
I know,it was hilarious.

420
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:42,132
你为什么这么做?
Why would you do that?

421
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:43,839
我想证实一点
I did it to prove a point.

422
00:19:43,944 --> 00:19:45,220
证实什么?
What point?

423
00:19:46,879 --> 00:19:49,823
别走开，我就想到了
Stay with me. It's going to come to me.

424
00:19:50,418 --> 00:19:52,518
哦 好 我要证实的是
Ah,okay,here's the point.

425
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,523
你确定了Mary的身份 对吗?
You thought that Mary was a sure thing,right?

426
00:19:54,686 --> 00:19:58,157
然后发生了什么? 第一次约会她就带你去了酒店房间
So what happened? She took you up to a hotel room on the first date.

427
00:19:58,253 --> 00:20:01,006
你要做的就是对每个女人都这样 
All you have to do is be that confident with every girl you meet

428
00:20:01,121 --> 00:20:02,118
你的阳痿就解决了
and your slump is over.

429
00:20:02,252 --> 00:20:05,149
你要传达的讯息就是我要像对待妓女一样对待每个女人?
So the message is,I should treat every woman like a whore?

430
00:20:05,312 --> 00:20:07,048
拜托 伙计 你不应该感谢我吗
Come on,dude,you should be thanking me.

431
00:20:07,182 --> 00:20:08,946
她打了我一个耳光，怒气冲冲的走了
She slapped me and stormed off.

432
00:20:09,052 --> 00:20:11,747
你能怪她吗? 你叫人家妓女
Can you blame her? You called her a hooker.

433
00:20:12,955 --> 00:20:15,056
对不起 伙计 这挺好笑
I'm sorry,dude,it was funny.

434
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:18,633
对 嗯 已经晚了 我要回我的房间了
Yeah. Well,it's getting late. I should get back to my room.

435
00:20:18,757 --> 00:20:19,410
你的房间?
Your room?

436
00:20:19,515 --> 00:20:22,421
对 那间非常贵的酒店房间是你用信用卡付款的--
Yeah,that really expensive hotel room you put on your credit card--

437
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:23,313
还没退房
never checked out.

438
00:20:23,438 --> 00:20:25,605
顺便说下 你知道什么超级有趣吗?
By the way,you know what's super fun?

439
00:20:25,701 --> 00:20:28,166
我要把Dom Perignon倒进下水道(Dom Perignon是一种昂贵的法国香槟)
Pouring Dom Perignon down a bathtub drain.

440
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,206
嗯  快三点了 我要按摩一下
Well,it's almost 3:00. Got a massage. Toodles.

441
00:20:34,102 --> 00:20:37,315
拜托 如果你不笑，那你好像太吝啬了
Come on,if you don't laugh,it just seems mean.

442
00:20:38,897 --> 00:20:42,110
