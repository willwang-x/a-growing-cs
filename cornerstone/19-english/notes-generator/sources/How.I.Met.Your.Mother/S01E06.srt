Season 01 Episode 06

4
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:15,699
你们知道
Robin阿姨是个万圣节迷
Now, as you know, aunt robin is a big fan of halloween 

5
00:00:15,747 --> 00:00:18,000
每次都装扮的很疯狂
always dressing up in crazy costumes

6
00:00:18,336 --> 00:00:20,014
但是她以前并不是那样
but she wasn't always that way.

7
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:23,275
回溯到2005年
她认为万圣节太幼稚了
Back in 2005,she thought she was too cool for halloween,

8
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:25,337
不象Lily阿姨
unlike aunt lily.

9
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,351
猜今天有什么东西寄过来了?
Guess what came in the mail today?

10
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:28,358
我们的服装吗?
Our costumes?

11
00:00:28,406 --> 00:00:29,988
-够劲爆吗？
-够劲爆
-Do they rule? -They rule.

12
00:00:30,036 --> 00:00:34,352
你的是100%羊毛的
这次不会象去年那样体温过高了
And yours is 100% wool,so you won't get hypothermia like last year.

13
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,277
泰山的蓝乳头
Tarzan nipples blue.

14
00:00:37,805 --> 00:00:39,003
你们知道我最喜欢
万圣节的什么吗?
You know what I love about halloween?

15
00:00:39,051 --> 00:00:43,223
这是个女人们释放内心欲望的夜晚
It's the one night of the year chicks use to unleash their inner ho-bag.

16
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:46,148
如果一个女生装扮成女巫
那么她就是个放浪的女巫
If a girl dresses up as a witch,she's a slutty witch.

17
00:00:46,196 --> 00:00:48,881
如果她装扮成一只猫
她就是一只放浪的猫
If she's a cat,she's a slutty cat.

18
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:49,505
如果她装扮成护士...
If she's a nurse...

19
00:00:49,553 --> 00:00:51,135
我们知道了
w,we get it.

20
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:53,964
... 她就是个放浪的护士
...She's a slutty nurse.

21
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,834
Robin, 万圣节你打算干嘛?
Robin,what are you doing for halloween?

22
00:00:55,882 --> 00:00:57,129
噢, 我也不知道
Oh,I don't know.

23
00:00:57,177 --> 00:00:59,623
可能跟Mike一起过
这家伙和我在约会
Probably hanging out with mike,this guy've been seeing.

24
00:00:59,671 --> 00:01:03,651
Mike? 有个Mike吗? 你有男朋友了
而你却没告诉我们?
Mike? There's a mike? You have a boyfriend 
and you haven't told us?

25
00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:07,727
不, 我是说, 他不是我男朋友
只是这几周和我约会的家伙
No,I mean,he's not my boyfriend. He's just this guy 
I've been seeing for a couple of weeks.

26
00:01:07,775 --> 00:01:11,083
- 男朋友!
- 那为什么我们没见过他?
-Boyfriend! -So why haven't we met him?

27
00:01:11,131 --> 00:01:13,097
我们还没准备好公开
We're not really ready to go public yet.

28
00:01:13,145 --> 00:01:15,255
结婚啦
Married.

29
00:01:15,591 --> 00:01:17,557
万圣节我们来个4人约会怎么样?
How about we go on a halloween double date?

30
00:01:17,605 --> 00:01:22,352
我不知道, 我们在考虑
是不是呆在家装扮成裸体人
I don't know,we were kind of thinking 
about staying at home and dressing up as naked people.

31
00:01:23,071 --> 00:01:25,184
拜托, Robin, 炫耀下你的新男友
Come on,robin,trot out your new fella.

32
00:01:25,184 --> 00:01:28,269
让我们有机会在你背后
评论他 这很好玩
Let us judge and evaluate him behind your back. It'll be fun.

33
00:01:29,785 --> 00:01:31,271
嘿, Ted, 你肯定猜不到发生什么了
Hey,ted,you'll never guess what happened.

34
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:32,140
- 你们的服装寄过来了?
- 我们的服...
-Your costumes came? Our cost...

35
00:01:32,141 --> 00:01:34,953
是啊 这就是为什么
我们是最好的朋友
-yes. That is why we're best friends.

36
00:01:35,683 --> 00:01:38,032
- 嘿, Ted, 万圣节打算怎么过?
- 嗯...
-Hey,ted,what are you doing for halloween? 
-Well...

37
00:01:38,368 --> 00:01:39,183
怎么?
what?

38
00:01:39,231 --> 00:01:42,012
每次万圣节, Ted都
在等那个放浪的南瓜
Every halloween,ted waits for the slutty pumpkin.

39
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:42,827
正确
That's right.

40
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:44,074
"放浪的南瓜"是什么东西?
What's the "slutty pumpkin"?

41
00:01:44,122 --> 00:01:48,390
你应该说谁是放浪的南瓜
那是4年前...
You mean who is the slutty pumpkin. 
It was four years ago...

42
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:50,835
就在我们楼顶的万圣节派对上
I was at this halloween party up on the roof of our building.

43
00:01:50,883 --> 00:01:56,973
在傍晚的时候不知从哪里
这个穿着性感南瓜装的女孩出现了
I'm about to call it an early night when out of nowhere appeared this girl in the sexiest pumpkin costume.

44
00:01:57,165 --> 00:01:59,898
等等, 南瓜装怎么个性感法?
Wait,how can a pumpkin costume be sexy?

45
00:01:59,946 --> 00:02:02,152
关键性的部位都挖空了
It was carved in strategic places.

46
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,660
后来, 呃, 我们去了吧台
我见识到了她的混合咖啡酒
So,uh,we're at the bar,and I see her mix kahlua. 

47
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:08,674
她自己发明调制的鸡尾酒
A cocktail she invented herself.

48
00:02:08,722 --> 00:02:10,496
她把它叫做... "巧克力糖"
And she called it... "the tootsie roll..."

49
00:02:10,544 --> 00:02:13,517
因为它尝起来象
酒味儿十足的巧克力糖
Because it tastes like an alcoholic tootsie roll.

50
00:02:13,565 --> 00:02:15,147
嘿! 我能自己讲这个吗?
Hey! Can I please tell the story?

51
00:02:15,195 --> 00:02:16,921
我们间来了点感觉
So we had this instant connection.

52
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:18,552
她给了我电话, 但是后来...
She gave me her number,but then...

53
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,805
发生了件很恐怖的事情
Something went terribly wrong.

54
00:02:20,853 --> 00:02:21,812
伙计们!
Guys!

55
00:02:22,532 --> 00:02:24,210
发生了件很恐怖的事情
Then something went terribly wrong.

56
00:02:24,881 --> 00:02:26,608
万圣节快乐
Happy halloween.

57
00:02:27,806 --> 00:02:28,909
Sonny, Cher在哪儿?
Sonny,where's cher?

58
00:02:28,957 --> 00:02:31,930
- Cher?
- 来啦, 宝贝
-Cher? 
-Right here,babe.

59
00:02:33,417 --> 00:02:35,095
我刚碰见了个完美的女人
I just met the perfect woman.

60
00:02:35,143 --> 00:02:38,548
她很风趣, 很漂亮，喜欢看星球大战
She's funny,she's beautiful,she loves star wars.

61
00:02:38,596 --> 00:02:40,370
哇, 哇, 她对伊娃族的看法呢?
Whoa,whoa,whoa,whoa,what's her take on ewoks?

62
00:02:40,418 --> 00:02:41,904
- 很喜欢 - 噢, 太好了
-Loves 'em. -Oh,good.

63
00:02:41,952 --> 00:02:46,700
我不明白为什么人们这么讨厌伊娃族
如果没有伊娃族反叛者就会输掉
I don't know why people are so cynical about ewoks. 
The rebellion would have failed without the ewoks.

64
00:02:46,747 --> 00:02:50,008
还有: 她是海洋生物学家
她花了一年在南极研究企鹅
And get this: She's a marine biologist. 
She spent a year in antarctica studying penguins.

65
00:02:50,056 --> 00:02:52,646
噢, 企鹅真酷
就象黑白的伊娃族
Oh,penguins are cool. Kind of like black and white ewoks.

66
00:02:52,694 --> 00:02:53,748
我同意
I approve.

67
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:56,817
嘿, 我的, 呃, 巧克力糖在哪?
我就放在这桌上了
Hey,where's my,uh,kit-kat? I put it right here on this table.

68
00:02:56,865 --> 00:02:58,879
我不知道
但这里有很多巧克力
I don't know,but we've plenty of chocolate here.

69
00:02:58,927 --> 00:03:01,133
不, 不, 你不明白
我需要那个巧克力糖
No,no,you don't understand.
I need that kit-kat

70
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,387
她把电话写在那个包装纸上了 在哪?
she wrote her number on that wrapper. Where is it?

71
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:07,750
嘿, ... 吸血鬼!
Hey,dracula!

72
00:03:07,798 --> 00:03:09,956
拜托, 给我... 把它给我!
Come on,give me the... give me it!

73
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:16,574
巧克力糖在哪?
巧克力糖在哪?!
Where's the kit-kat? 
Where's the kit-kat?!

74
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,012
再也找不到她的电话号码了
Never found her number

75
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,163
再也没见过她了
never saw her again.

76
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:22,855
但是每年他们都在楼顶办派对
那就是我要去的地方
But every year,they have a halloween party up on the roof,
so that's where I'll be.

77
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:24,534
你知道, Ted, 已经4年了
You know,ted,it's been four years.

78
00:03:24,582 --> 00:03:29,904
她可能已经订婚或者结婚了
或者, 老天保佑, 变得很胖
She could be engaged or married,or,god forbid,fat.

79
00:03:30,863 --> 00:03:32,206
我不知道, 我有种感觉
I don't know,I got a feeling

80
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:35,754
就是今年了 万圣节是
一个充满未知和魔法的夜晚
this could be the year. Halloween is a night of wonder and magic.

81
00:03:35,802 --> 00:03:38,967
- 好吧
- 尽管嘲笑, 没事, 我能承受住
-all right.
-bring the mockery,fine,I can take it.

82
00:03:39,015 --> 00:03:43,523
但是拜托, 如果那放浪的南瓜
真是我未来的老婆这不是很酷吗?
But come on,wouldn't it be the coolest story ever 
if the slutty pumpkin turned out to be my future wife?

83
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:49,229
噢, 为了以防万一
我们也许该停止叫她放浪的南瓜
Oh,on the off-chance that that could happen,
maybe we should stop calling her the slutty pumpkin.

84
00:03:49,277 --> 00:03:51,483
- 这提议不错
- 这主意不错
-That's a really good point.  
-That's a good idea.

85
00:03:51,866 --> 00:03:56,034
Ted, 你准备好被震撼了吗
震撼, 震撼?
-Ted,is your world ready to be rocked,rock,rocked?

86
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,500
等不及了
-Can't wait.

87
00:04:02,032 --> 00:04:03,327
那么... 你觉得怎么样?
So... what do you think?

88
00:04:03,758 --> 00:04:05,581
那么, 你觉得怎么样?
So,what do you think?

89
00:04:08,026 --> 00:04:09,465
Marshall, 你画眼影了
Marshall,are you wearing eyeliner

90
00:04:09,513 --> 00:04:12,390
噢, 是啊, 另类的性感, 是不?
oh,yeah. Weirdly hot,right?

91
00:04:13,157 --> 00:04:15,603
我们会赢得今年的最佳装扮奖
We are so going to win the costume contest this year.

92
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:18,480
第一名的奖金, 50元的酒吧消费卷
First prize: $50 gift certificate at the bar.

93
00:04:18,528 --> 00:04:20,302
你们的服装花了多少钱?
And how much did you pay for your costumes?

94
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,843
- 100块
- 一个人
-$100. 
-Each.

95
00:04:23,611 --> 00:04:25,720
嗯, 我觉得你们看起来很不错
Well,I think you guys look great.

96
00:04:25,768 --> 00:04:28,981
你要扮成什么? 噢, 我干嘛问
What are you going as? Oh,like I even need to ask.

97
00:04:29,029 --> 00:04:32,721
嘿, 我希望放浪的南瓜认的出我
她见到我的时候我是个...
Hey,I want the slutty pumpkin to recognize me,and she knows me as...

98
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:34,496
一个投票牌
a hanging chad.

99
00:04:35,119 --> 00:04:36,749
怎么? 她觉得很不错啊
What? She thought it was hilarious.

100
00:04:36,797 --> 00:04:41,161
嗯, 4年前了, 但是没人会记得投票牌是什么
Yeah,four years ago,but nobody remembers 
what the hell a hanging chad is.

101
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:47,491
多可悲的观点啊，我们怎能忘记政治历史上如此动荡的时刻
What a sad commentary on our national attention span that we could forget such a turbulent time in our political history.

102
00:04:47,682 --> 00:04:49,361
可悲的观点
Sad commentary.

103
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,662
好吧, Polly要尿尿了
all right,polly got to pee.

104
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,341
又要?
Again?

105
00:04:53,724 --> 00:04:54,492
你去干什么?
Where you going?

106
00:04:54,635 --> 00:04:57,656
这是套精心制作的制服
It's an elaborate costume.

107
00:05:21,105 --> 00:05:25,660
别, 别, 别又这样, 别今年
你要装扮成我的僚机飞行员，穿上
no,no,not again,not this year. You're going as my wingman. Flight suit up.

108
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:28,106
不 谢了 我仍着迷我的选举牌
No thanks. I'm sticking with the hanging chad.

109
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,640
噢, 你危险了, 迷途羔羊
Oh,you're dangerous,maverick.

110
00:05:29,688 --> 00:05:32,661
你的身体兑现不了你的自以为是开出的支票
Your ego's writing checks your body can't cash.

111
00:05:33,093 --> 00:05:34,196
好吧
Okay.

112
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:38,032
现在有个计划，我可以让你改变主意
Here's the plan,and I crap you not.

113
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,300
我能把我们弄进维多利亚的秘密万圣派对
I'm getting us into the victoria's secret halloween party.

114
00:05:42,348 --> 00:05:46,567
相信我, 今晚你的牌子不会挂起来
Trust me,by the end of the night,your chad will not be hanging.

115
00:05:46,903 --> 00:05:48,917
我们能在一年里的任何一晚被那些模特拒绝
We can get rejected by supermodels any night of the year.

116
00:05:48,965 --> 00:05:53,377
今晚我要去楼顶，喝点啤酒, 等着放浪南瓜
Tonight I'm going up to the roof,I'm going to have a few beers,
I'm going to wait for the slutty pumpkin.

117
00:05:53,425 --> 00:05:54,623
这就是我要做的
It's just what I do.

118
00:05:55,774 --> 00:05:59,371
维多利亚秘密派对的模特们在酒吧里狂欢...
Victoria's secret models prancing around in bras and panties...

119
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:03,830
或者耶鲁预科毕业生的愚蠢卡聚会
or yale preppies reuniting their stupid a capella group.

120
00:06:03,878 --> 00:06:07,475
你说什么, 左手?
"右手真逊"? 说对了
What's that,left hand? 
"Right hand sucks"? Word.

121
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:08,577
我要去楼顶了
Heading up to the roof.

122
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,496
好吧, 伙计们, 看起来就我们3个
Well,boys,looks like it's just the three of us.

123
00:06:10,543 --> 00:06:13,564
什么? "自己击掌"? 好的
我们出去了
What's that? "Self five"? 
Nice. We out.

124
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:17,736
嘿, 投票牌, 挂的怎么样?
Hey,chad,how's it hanging?

125
00:06:17,784 --> 00:06:19,654
嘿, 拼字游戏, 好玩
Hey,word play,funny.

126
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,531
哇 不错的服装
Whoo,nice outfit.

127
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:24,833
- 我是鹦鹉
- 你当然是
-I'm a parrot.
-You sure are.

128
00:06:25,313 --> 00:06:27,087
Mike在哪? 他会来这找我
Where's mike? He's meeting me here.

129
00:06:27,135 --> 00:06:32,026
村庄里的万圣节游行我去晚了
那里, 就象, 千万个同性恋海盗
I ran late covering the halloween parade in the village. 
There are,like,a zillion gay pirates this year.

130
00:06:32,074 --> 00:06:35,047
认真的说, 我的眼影看起来还好吧?
Seriously,does my eyeliner look okay?

131
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:37,061
对, 另类的性感
Yes,it's weirdly hot.

132
00:06:37,492 --> 00:06:39,075
嗯, 你的服装呢?
So,where's your costume?

133
00:06:39,219 --> 00:06:43,870
呃, 我和Mike想着一起做些什么
最后决定我们都不装扮
uh,you know,mike and I joked about doing something together,
but we decided not to dress up.

134
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:47,754
噢, 天那
Oh,geez.

135
00:06:49,049 --> 00:06:52,693
呃, 各位, 这是Michael
这不是他的头发
Uh,everyone,this is michael. 
That is not his real hair.

136
00:06:52,837 --> 00:06:54,899
呃, 你的服装呢, Gretel?
<font color=#fff000>格林童话《Hansel & Gretel》里的人物
中文译名《糖果屋》</font>
Um,where's your costume,gretel?

137
00:06:54,947 --> 00:07:02,811
你认为我是... 噢, 我是在开玩笑
我得停止在邮件上开玩笑
这样很难传达到我的想法
You thought I was... oh,I was just kidding. 
I've got to stop making jokes in e-mails. It's so hard to convey tone.

138
00:07:03,147 --> 00:07:06,455
我想我们肯定打败他们
I think we got them beat.

139
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:12,402
- 我不敢相信你说服我来这
- 我没有 是你自己跟过来的
-I can't believe you talked me into this.  
-I didn't. You followed me up here.

140
00:07:13,265 --> 00:07:15,039
这派对真烂
This party sucks.

141
00:07:15,087 --> 00:07:17,580
只有7个女人
There's seven chicks here.

142
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,170
只有6个了
There's six chicks here.

143
00:07:21,081 --> 00:07:23,910
放松点 夜晚才刚刚开始 会变好的
Relax. The night is young. It's going to get better.

144
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:28,513
先生们小姐们，仍然和95年见面会时一样
Ladies and gentlemen,as on pitch as they were at spring fling '95,

145
00:07:28,561 --> 00:07:31,966
我荣幸的欢迎Shaggarats
it's my pleasure to welcome back the shaggarats.

146
00:07:52,024 --> 00:07:56,675
海盗最喜欢的是哪类毛线衫?
What be a pirate's favorite kind of sweater?

147
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:58,737
Arr-gyle
Arr-gyle.

148
00:08:00,415 --> 00:08:06,937
海盗最喜欢的快餐店是哪家?
And what be a pirate's favorite fast food restaurant?

149
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:09,287
Arr-by's
Arr-by'S.

150
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:12,691
你可能觉得是Arby's（美国知名三明治快餐店）
You would think it would be arby's.

151
00:08:12,739 --> 00:08:14,753
但是, 事实上, 是Long John Silver's
<font color=#fff000>美国另一知名快餐店</font>
But,actually,it's long john silver'S.

152
00:08:16,815 --> 00:08:19,548
事实上, 我需要这只手来吃饭 噢...
actually,I kind of need this hand to eat. Oh..

153
00:08:29,858 --> 00:08:33,119
很高兴见到你, Mike 你们在一起太配了
It's so nice to meet you,mike. You guys are really cute together.

154
00:08:33,167 --> 00:08:37,914
对啊, 我们在一起渡过了很多时光
我们甚至分享对方的...
Yeah,we've been spending a lot of time together. 
We're even getting to that point where we finish each other'S.

155
00:08:38,873 --> 00:08:42,182
...这汉堡太... 棒了 看?
.. this cheeseburger is so... good. See?

156
00:08:43,668 --> 00:08:45,922
我觉得你该赢得今晚的免费卷, 宝贝
I think you won the dish-off tonight,baby.

157
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,087
这牛排打败了我的猪排
This steak totally bitch-slapped my pork chops.

158
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:56,759
可能是真的,但是如果吃了一点你的肉饭我的菠菜就可以被踢走了
That may be true,but your rice pilaf kicked my spinach in the crotch so hard it threw up a little bit.

159
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:02,657
Robin, 你得尝尝这鸡肉
Robin,you have to try this chicken.

160
00:09:02,705 --> 00:09:05,534
噢, 没事, 我很好, 谢谢
Oh,that's good,I'm okay,thanks.

161
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:10,425
- 这真的很好吃
- 我正在品尝这个汉堡
-It's really tasty. 
-I'm just really feeling this cheeseburger.

162
00:09:10,569 --> 00:09:12,152
来吧, 只尝一点就好了
Come on,just try a little bite.

163
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,837
伙计, 别侵犯我的个人空间
Dude,I'm kind of in the zone here.

164
00:09:18,098 --> 00:09:19,632
噢, 为了上帝
Oh,for god's sakes.

165
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:24,331
真的很好吃
Really tasty.

166
00:09:40,731 --> 00:09:44,375
在这儿要想“戴花环”该怎么做呢?
<font color=#fff000>与上床谐音</font>
So what does a fella have to do to get lei'd around here?

167
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:52,575
嗯 对 因为我戴了花环
Yeah. Right. 'Cause I'm wearing a lei.

168
00:09:52,623 --> 00:09:55,932
如果你解释了笑话就不好笑了
It isn't funny if you explain the joke.

169
00:09:57,754 --> 00:10:00,247
- 我们走吧
- 别, Barney, 来吧 我玩的很开心
-Let's bail. 
-No,barney,come on. I'm having fun.

170
00:10:00,295 --> 00:10:03,220
另外, 再见到这些家伙感觉不错
Plus,it's really great to see all these guys again.

171
00:10:03,316 --> 00:10:05,522
说出一个这派对上你知道的人的名字
Name one person you know at this party.

172
00:10:05,618 --> 00:10:08,064
嗯, 那是忍者
Well,there's ninja,

173
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:12,571
马屁股 嘿, 马头哪去了?
那家伙是个有趣的人-- 他在哪?
back of horse. Hey,where's front of horse? 
That guy's a riot-- where is he?

174
00:10:13,818 --> 00:10:18,229
好吧, 我要走了 但是你要知道
维多利亚秘密派对在一艘游艇上
Okay,I'm leaving. But just know,
that this victoria secret party is on a yacht

175
00:10:18,277 --> 00:10:22,497
谁会在那艘游艇上呢?
"白额黑雁"
And what will be sticking to that yacht?
The "barnacle."

176
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:23,792
是吗?
Really?

177
00:10:23,888 --> 00:10:24,703
这是你的呢称吗?
That's your nickname now?

178
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:27,436
- 对, 白额黑雁 - 白额黑雁?
- 就这个
-Yeah,the barnacle. -The barnacle? 
-That's it.

179
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,786
白额黑雁, 走啦
Barnacle,out.

180
00:10:29,834 --> 00:10:30,505
玩的开心点, 白额黑雁
Have fun,barnacle.

181
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,636
嗯... 你喜欢Mike吗?
So... do you like mike?

182
00:10:35,684 --> 00:10:36,979
你喜欢Mike吗?
Do you like mike?

183
00:10:37,027 --> 00:10:38,849
当然了 为什么?
Of course I do. Why?

184
00:10:38,897 --> 00:10:43,069
只是看起来不是那样
你不分享你的食物, 你不装扮
It just doesn't seem like it. 
You won't share your food,you won't wear a costume.

185
00:10:43,117 --> 00:10:46,473
噢, Lily, 你知道我
我只不是喜欢那些情侣的事情什么的
Oh,lily,you know me.
I'm just not into all that coupley stuff.

186
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,638
好吧, 我知道外面看起来这些事情很傻
Okay,I know that stuff looks dumb from the outside,

187
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:53,186
但是当你成为其中一员时,就成了世界上最美妙的事情
but it's kind of the greatest thing in the world when you're a part of it.

188
00:10:53,234 --> 00:10:55,584
你如果试一下, 你可能会喜欢上它
If you just gave it a chance,you might like it

189
00:10:55,632 --> 00:10:58,030
你想让我加如什么异教吗?
Are you trying to get me to join a cult?

190
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:00,139
Robin, Mike喜欢你
Robin,mike likes you.

191
00:11:00,187 --> 00:11:02,825
如果你不做些什么, 你将会失去他
If you don't start meeting him halfway,you're gonna lose him.

192
00:11:02,873 --> 00:11:03,880
什么?
What?

193
00:11:04,024 --> 00:11:07,716
听着, 今天是万圣节
只是这一晚穿上女朋友的服装
Look,it's halloween. Just put on the girlfriend costume for a night.

194
00:11:07,764 --> 00:11:11,264
好吧, 嗯, 我该怎么做
Okay,well,what am i supposed to do,

195
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,141
给他买个巨型泰迪熊吗?
buy him a giant teddy bear or something?

196
00:11:14,381 --> 00:11:17,786
分享你的甜点怎么样?
How about you start by sharing dessert?

197
00:11:18,121 --> 00:11:20,663
- 我可以做到分享甜点
- 很好
-I can share dessert.
-Good.

198
00:11:21,526 --> 00:11:23,204
他更喜欢果仁圣代
He better want the brownie sundae,

199
00:11:23,252 --> 00:11:26,129
但是好, 好, 我完全可以分享
but yeah,yeah,I can totally share.

200
00:11:32,757 --> 00:11:35,298
- Barney? 什么, 你又回来了?
- 你说对了
-barney? What,you're back?
-That's right.

201
00:11:35,346 --> 00:11:37,216
穿着全新的服装
In a totally new costume.

202
00:11:37,312 --> 00:11:42,539
我每个万圣节我都带着一套多余的服装
以防在派对上被女孩踢出局
Every halloween I bring a spare costume,
in case I strike out with the hottest girl at the party.

203
00:11:42,587 --> 00:11:46,567
这样我就可以有第二次机会
给她一个好的第一印象
That way I have a second chance to make a first impression.

204
00:11:46,663 --> 00:11:47,766
你脸怎么啦?
What's with the face?

205
00:11:47,814 --> 00:11:50,451
一边是对你的同情
一边是我想上厕所
It's half you're pathetic,half I have to pee.

206
00:11:50,547 --> 00:11:51,602
那就去厕所啊
So go to the bathroom.

207
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:54,239
不, 我有大事要做
我不想错过"放浪南瓜"
No,there's a huge line. I don't want to miss the "slutty pumpkin."

208
00:11:54,383 --> 00:11:55,630
那就从楼顶上尿下去
So pee off the roof.

209
00:11:55,678 --> 00:11:57,788
噢, Ted, 在楼顶上尿吧
Ooh, ted, pee off the roof.

210
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:01,048
哇, 如果我是你我不会这样
有人在这走来走去
Whoa, I wouldn't do that if I were you, 
there's people walking down there.

211
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:03,542
来吧, Ted, 你会听谁的?
Come on, ted, who you gonna listen to?

212
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,275
我, 还是那边的假正经先生?
Me, or mr. Goody-goody over there? 

213
00:12:06,966 --> 00:12:09,104
嗯, 无论如何, 你们有大麻吗?
Yeah, whatever, you guys got some weed? 

214
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,701
往左挪一点, Marshall Lily, 蹲下
A little to the left, marshall. Lily, squat down. 

215
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:19,270
你们都等着惨败吧
没有一个人的装扮能跟我们相比的!
This is gonna be a slaughter. 
None of these other costumes even come close to ourrr...s!

216
00:12:19,318 --> 00:12:20,901
快拍吧
Take the damn picture.

217
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:23,346
好了
got it.

218
00:12:23,921 --> 00:12:25,983
我还是觉得我们
应该以Sonny和Cher来赢
I still think we should have won as sonny and cher.

219
00:12:26,031 --> 00:12:28,189
也许我该穿那套红衣服
Maybe if I'd worn the red dress.

220
00:12:28,525 --> 00:12:30,683
如果我能回到以前
If I could turn back time.

221
00:12:32,409 --> 00:12:35,670
噢, 哇, 这些圣代看起来来太棒了
我能整个吃下去
oh, wow, this sundae looks so good. I could eat the whole thing.

222
00:12:36,101 --> 00:12:41,280
但, 呃, 我宁愿和你一起
分享这个小小的圣代, Mike
But, um, I would much rather share this small, one-scoop sundae with you, mike.

223
00:12:41,376 --> 00:12:43,822
法式苹果挞? 绝妙的选择, Lily派 谢谢
Apple tart? Excellent choice, lily-pad. Thanks,

224
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,020
Marshall瓜
marshmallow.

225
00:12:45,596 --> 00:12:49,672
嗯, 让我们也开始
Mi... Mi... Mike微波炉
Well, let's dig in, mi... mi... microwave oven.

226
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,179
让我猜猜
Let me guess.

227
00:12:54,227 --> 00:12:57,680
这里的每个家伙都和你开了花环玩笑, 是不?
Every guy's used the lei'd line on you tonight, huh?

228
00:12:57,728 --> 00:13:00,988
- 你不会相信
- 我为我的同性道歉
-You wouldn't believe. 
-I apologize for my gender.

229
00:13:01,084 --> 00:13:02,954
让我弥补点什么
要喝点什么吗?
Let me make it up to you
make you a drink?

230
00:13:03,913 --> 00:13:05,975
噢 你真是个迷人的恶魔
Oh. You certainly are a charming devil.

231
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:09,236
我还是个有角的恶魔
<font color=#fff000>与“淫荡”同词</font>
I'm also a "horny" devil. 

232
00:13:12,545 --> 00:13:13,792
不
no.

233
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,354
噢, 下地狱吧
Oh, go to hell.

234
00:13:23,814 --> 00:13:26,935
如果你们喜欢提拉米苏
我们找到一家意大利餐厅
You know, if you guys like tiramisu,
we found this little Italian place...

235
00:13:26,936 --> 00:13:28,746
不，你找到的，我跟着你去的
No, you found it. I came with you.

237
00:13:31,534 --> 00:13:33,356
我刚刚在说, 我们喜欢提拉米苏

238
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,281
- 我怎么吃也吃不够
- 我们为此疯狂
-I can't get enough of it. 
-We're crazy for the stuff.

239
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:39,446
我疯了, 你也为...
I'm crazy, and you're crazy... ...

240
00:13:39,542 --> 00:13:41,891
- 提拉米苏疯狂
- 对
-for tiramisu. 
-Right

241
00:13:42,035 --> 00:13:43,905
“我们”喜欢提拉米苏
We love tiramisu.

242
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:44,990
我说错了吗？
I wrong saying that?

243
00:13:45,076 --> 00:13:46,934
不, 不, 不 我的意思是
这听起来有点奇怪
No, no, no. I mean, 
it just sounds a little bit weird. 

244
00:13:47,022 --> 00:13:48,077
是吗?
Doesn't it?

245
00:13:48,173 --> 00:13:49,564
我们喜欢吃提拉米苏?
We love tiramisu?

246
00:13:49,612 --> 00:13:53,927
这不就是两个人一起的活动吗
喜欢提拉米苏?
Isn't really a group activity.
Loving tiramisu?

247
00:13:57,044 --> 00:14:00,641
说说这个意大利餐厅
那里的奶油甜馅煎饼卷怎么样?
So this italian place,
how is their cannoli?

248
00:14:01,935 --> 00:14:04,477
慢点吃, 很饿吗
Easy there, hungry.

249
00:14:08,457 --> 00:14:11,094
是啊, 看起来“我们”都很饿
Yeah, looks like we're both hungry.

250
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,732
- 嘿, 不是Gary Oldman吗? 等等...

251
00:14:16,848 --> 00:14:18,287
我没看见...
I don't see...

252
00:14:23,706 --> 00:14:25,336
脑袋冻得痛
brain freeze.

253
00:14:27,494 --> 00:14:29,891
- 好吧, 维多利亚秘密派对, 现在
- 不去
-Okay, victoria secret party, right now. 
-Nope

254
00:14:29,939 --> 00:14:36,269
我不能忍受自己的好朋友又浪费一个万圣节
Ted, "放浪南瓜"不会出现的
Come on. I can't stand watching my delusional friend waste another precious halloween.
Ted, the "slutty pumpkin" is not coming.

255
00:14:36,317 --> 00:14:37,516
她可能会
She might.

256
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,968
拜托, Barney, 这跟概率没关系,这是信念的问题
come on,Barney, this is not about the odds. 
It's about believing.

257
00:14:41,016 --> 00:14:46,435
这个女孩, 她对我来说
代表着一些东西，我不知道 希望
This girl, she... she represents something to me. 
I don't know. Hope.

258
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,853
哇 你刚才说的话我一个字也不明白
Wow. I did not understand a word you just said.

259
00:14:53,004 --> 00:14:57,176
在船上的内衣模特!
Lingerie models on a boat!

260
00:14:57,512 --> 00:15:01,396
再见
不 我说再见
See ya. 
No. See ya.

261
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,773
想喝点融掉了的吗?
Want to drink the melty part?

262
00:15:08,253 --> 00:15:10,075
你知道吗? 太迟了
You know what? It's getting late. 

263
00:15:10,123 --> 00:15:12,041
我想我要离开了
I think I'm gonna take off.

264
00:15:14,631 --> 00:15:18,227
我以为我们会顺着面包屑回我家, Hansel
<font color=#fff000>《糖果屋》中，兄妹俩循着
事先扔下的面包屑回家</font>
Hey. I thought we were gonna follow those bread crumbs back to my place, hansel.

265
00:15:18,275 --> 00:15:20,864
Robin, 我不觉得你喜欢和我在一起
Robin, I don't get the sense you like being with me.

266
00:15:20,912 --> 00:15:22,159
我喜欢和你一起
I like being with you.

267
00:15:22,207 --> 00:15:23,789
没你喜欢一个呆着多
Not as much as you like being alone.

268
00:15:23,837 --> 00:15:28,297
你喜欢... 吃你自己的食物, 睡在自己的床上
做自己的拼字游戏
You like... eatng your own food, sleeping in your own bed, doing your own crosswords.

269
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:29,831
谁用墨水?
Who uses ink?

270
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,845
抱歉
Sorry.

271
00:15:31,893 --> 00:15:35,777
好吧, 我是有点太自我了
但这并不表示不可行啊
Okay, I'm a bit set in my ways, 
that doesn't mean that this won't work.

272
00:15:35,825 --> 00:15:38,463
事实上, 这并不可行
Actually, it kind of does.

273
00:15:38,798 --> 00:15:39,997
等等, 我们要分手吗?
Wait, are we breaking up?

274
00:15:40,045 --> 00:15:43,018
不, “我们”不分手
No, we aren't breaking up.

275
00:15:43,066 --> 00:15:46,135
是“我”要和你分手
I'm breaking up with you.

276
00:15:49,731 --> 00:15:52,752
就在我快失去希望的时候...
And then just when I was about to lose hope... 

277
00:15:57,835 --> 00:16:00,521
她花了一年在南极研究企鹅
she spent a year in antarctica studying penguins.

278
00:16:00,952 --> 00:16:03,781
咖啡酒, 纯啤酒...
Kahlua, root beer...

279
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:07,042
这只企鹅会是"放浪南瓜"吗?
could this penguin be the "slutty pumpkin?"

280
00:16:14,205 --> 00:16:16,603
打扰下 这听起来很疯狂
excuse me. This is going to sound crazy,

281
00:16:16,651 --> 00:16:19,624
但是我4年前在这楼顶上认识了个人
but I met someone up on this roof four years ago,

282
00:16:19,672 --> 00:16:24,131
她喝这样混合的鸡尾酒, 她也喜欢企鹅
and they mixed that cocktail, and-and they loved penguins.

283
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:27,488
有可能, 是你吗?
By any chance, was that you?

284
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,557
是你吧
It's you.

285
00:16:30,653 --> 00:16:32,331
每个人都觉得我疯了, 但是我...
Everyone thought I was crazy, but I came...

286
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:34,681
你这个输家
you are such a loser.

287
00:16:35,016 --> 00:16:37,270
拜托, 我是为你回来的, Ted
Come on, I came back for you, ted.

288
00:16:37,318 --> 00:16:40,819
我穿企鹅装来证明你的方式错了
I penguin-suited up to show you the error of your ways.

289
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:44,223
还拿到了草裙女郎的电话,多确认几遍
And to score hula girl's number. Check and check. 

290
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:46,813
- 不可置信
- 是啊, 确实
-Unbelievable. 
-Yes, it is.

291
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:50,313
噢. 等等 你是那个蹩脚军人
Oh. Wait a minute. You're that lame army guy.

292
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:53,526
什么? 不, 不, 那是别人,他是出色的飞行员
What? No, no, that's some other guy, 
and he was a kick-ass fighter pilot.

293
00:16:53,574 --> 00:16:54,964
我不赶相信我给了你电话
I cannot believe i gave you my number.

294
00:16:55,012 --> 00:16:56,307
对, 嗯, 你给了 谢谢
Yeah, well, you did. Thanks.

295
00:16:56,355 --> 00:16:57,170
对, 嗯, 还给我
Yeah. Well, give it back.

296
00:16:57,218 --> 00:16:59,280
嗯, 呃, 我不这样想
我赚来的, 很公平
Well, uh, I don't think so. 
I earned it, fair and square.

297
00:16:59,328 --> 00:17:00,335
我会给你打电话
I'm calling you.

298
00:17:00,383 --> 00:17:02,829
但我绝对不会和你出去
But I'm never gonna go out with you.

299
00:17:02,876 --> 00:17:04,603
但你怎么会知道是我呢?
But how will you know it's me?

300
00:17:04,651 --> 00:17:07,384
我是误导高手
I'm a master of disguise.

301
00:17:12,467 --> 00:17:13,474
很好
nice.

302
00:17:13,714 --> 00:17:16,351
来吧, Ted,维多利亚秘密派对, 就是现在, 走吧
Come on, ted. Victoria secret party, now, let's go.

303
00:17:16,783 --> 00:17:17,885
我要呆在这
I'm staying.

304
00:17:18,029 --> 00:17:20,475
好! 好吧...
Fine! Fine... 

305
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:21,865
你要干什么?
what are you doing?

306
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:24,455
我用翅膀把你弹开
I'm flippering you off.

307
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:29,682
噢, 甜心, 我很抱歉
Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry. 

308
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:30,976
说真的, 这没什么大不了的
Seriously, it's not a big deal.

309
00:17:31,024 --> 00:17:33,038
他想成为我们
He wanted to be a we,

310
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:34,812
我想成为我自己
and I wanted to be an I.

311
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,587
男人真幼稚
Dudes are such chicks.

312
00:17:38,649 --> 00:17:40,183
伙计们, 我没事
You guys, I'm fine. 

313
00:17:40,423 --> 00:17:41,670
先生们小姐们
Ladies and gentlemen,

314
00:17:41,718 --> 00:17:43,108
要公布结果了
the results are in.

315
00:17:43,156 --> 00:17:46,753
今年的最佳装扮奖获得者是...
And the winners of this year's costume contest are...

316
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,575
Lily Aldren装扮的鹦鹉
lily aldren as a parrot,

317
00:17:48,623 --> 00:17:51,356
和Marshall Erikson装扮的同性恋海盗!
and marshall erikson as a gay pirate!

318
00:17:51,835 --> 00:17:53,082
等等, 他说什么?
Wait, what did he say?

319
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,856
噢, 谁在意呢, Marshall? 我们赢了!
Oh, who cares, marshall? We won!

320
00:17:54,904 --> 00:17:57,206
噢, 耶! 等等 同性恋海盗
你从哪听来的?
Oh, yeah!   Wait. Gay pirate
where are you getting that from?

321
00:17:57,254 --> 00:17:59,700
- 兄弟, 你涂眼影了
- 好吧
-Dude, you're wearing eyeliner. 
-OK

322
00:17:59,843 --> 00:18:04,495
我只是想说清楚我不是什么同性恋海盗
我一直都和我的鹦鹉有性关系
I just want everybody here to know I'm not a gay pirate. 
I have sex with my parrot all the time.

323
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:06,173
这样说有点问题
That came out wrong.

324
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,009
噢, 耶, 没关系 我们赢了!
Oh, yeah, doesn't matter. We won!

325
00:18:10,057 --> 00:18:13,174
- 我爱你, Marshall瓜
- 我也爱你 Lily派
-I love you, marshmallow. 
-I love you, too, lily pad.

326
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,284
你们两个家伙, 让我拍张照
You guys, let me get a picture.

327
00:18:29,478 --> 00:18:31,732
直觉告诉我你在这
I had a feeling I'd find you here.

328
00:18:33,074 --> 00:18:36,143
噢, 嘿 如果你来是为了看Shaggarats
你刚刚错过了第四次演奏的机会
Oh, hey. If you're here for the shaggarats, 
you just missed the fourth encore.

329
00:18:36,766 --> 00:18:39,500
我从来不参加组队的运动
I never played any team sports.

330
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:43,336
我们再说 "我从来不"吗?
因为除了杏仁酒以外什么都没了吗
Are we playing "I never"? 
Cause there's nothing left but peach schnapps.

331
00:18:44,631 --> 00:18:47,316
我在高中打网球 知道为什么吗?
I played tennis in high school. You know why? 

332
00:18:47,364 --> 00:18:51,152
因为只有我在那
我甚至不能忍受打双打
Because it was just me out there. 
I couldn't even stand playing doubles.

333
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:54,173
我刚被甩了
I just got dumped. 

334
00:18:54,413 --> 00:18:56,283
噢, 伙计, 这太糟了
Oh, man, that sucks. 

335
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:57,913
嗯 这没什么
Yeah. It's okay.

336
00:18:57,961 --> 00:18:59,640
我也不是那么迷他
I wasn't that into him.

337
00:18:59,688 --> 00:19:01,078
我的故事
Story of my life.

338
00:19:01,126 --> 00:19:08,031
其他人都沉浸在爱河里做着愚蠢甜蜜的疯事，但是不是我
Everyone else is off falling in love and acting stupid and goofy and sweet and insane, but not me.

339
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:09,757
为什么我不喜欢这些?
Why don't i want that more?

340
00:19:09,805 --> 00:19:11,867
我希望我想要那些
I want to want that.

341
00:19:11,915 --> 00:19:13,977
我是个怪胎吗?
Am I wired wrong or something?

342
00:19:14,025 --> 00:19:15,032
不是
no.

343
00:19:15,464 --> 00:19:19,300
听着, 你不想和我在一起, 所以
很明显, 你对男人有非同一般的品味
Look, you didn't want to be with me, so, 
clearly, you have abysmal taste in men.

344
00:19:20,882 --> 00:19:22,896
但是你怪的刚刚好
but you're wired just fine.

345
00:19:23,711 --> 00:19:27,787
好吧, 如果我是个...冷淡的人呢?
Well, what if I'm just a... a cold person?

346
00:19:27,931 --> 00:19:31,959
今晚Mike愿意为我
做一个彻底的傻瓜, 但是
Tonight mike was willing to look like a complete idiot for me, but

347
00:19:32,007 --> 00:19:35,172
我不愿意做Gretel
为什么我不愿意做Gretel呢?
I couldn't be gretel. Why can't I be gretel?

348
00:19:35,316 --> 00:19:38,001
因为你还没碰到你的Hansel
Because you just haven't met the right hansel yet.

349
00:19:38,241 --> 00:19:42,125
嘿, 有一天，你会遇到一个
让你想做那些白痴事情的人
Hey, one day, you're gonna meet a guy 
who's gonna make you want to look like a complete idiot.

350
00:19:42,605 --> 00:19:43,564
真的吗?
真的
Really?
Yeah.

351
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,194
就在某处
He's out there somewhere.

352
00:19:45,242 --> 00:19:48,455
就想那个放浪的南瓜... 南瓜, 南瓜...
Just like the slutty pumpkin... pumpkin, pumpkin...

353
00:19:49,941 --> 00:19:51,907
你怎么做到这些的, Ted?
how do you do this, ted?

354
00:19:52,099 --> 00:19:58,573
你是怎么在这么冷的楼顶上等整晚
仍然相信你的南瓜会出现?
How do you sit out here all night on the roof in the cold, 
and still have faith your pumpkin's gonna show up?

355
00:19:58,621 --> 00:20:00,443
嗯, 我喝的很醉
Well, I'm pretty drunk.

356
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:08,312
听着, 我知道我一生的最爱
穿着南瓜装在……
look, I know that odds are,the love of my life isn't gonna magically walk through that door in a pumpkin costume

357
00:20:08,752 --> 00:20:10,516
零晨2:43走来的几率很低
2:43 in the morning,

358
00:20:12,191 --> 00:20:15,356
但是这看起来
比任何境况都好, 你知道
but this seems as nice a spot as any to just, you know,

359
00:20:15,596 --> 00:20:17,226
坐下来等吧
sit and wait.

360
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:30,269
