1
00:00:13,147 --> 00:00:14,451
现在我还记得很多
Now I remember a lot of stories from back in the days

2
00:00:14,605 --> 00:00:16,791
遇见你妈妈之前的事情
before I met your mother.

3
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:19,218
但有一个故事我是不记得的
But there's one story I don't remember.

4
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:20,531
Marshall叔叔一直
Uncle Marshall still refers to

5
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:22,641
把它称为菠萝事件
it as "the pineapple incident."

6
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:24,502
那个晚上和平时没两样
The night started like any other.

7
00:00:24,674 --> 00:00:26,171
我们在楼下的酒吧
We were downstairs at the bar. 

8
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:27,321
我请的
Hey, it's on the house.

9
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,825
是我自己调的
it's my own concoction.

10
00:00:30,036 --> 00:00:31,522
我叫它红龙
I call it the red dragon.

11
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:34,121
谢谢! 这太好了
All: Thanks! That was really sweet.

12
00:00:34,342 --> 00:00:35,435
我们不是真的要尝吧, 是不?
We're not really doing shots,are we?

13
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:36,864
我可不想
别, 别, 别
I hope not. No,no,no.

14
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,434
这些看起来象血
these look kind of like blood.

15
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:43,194
好了, 我知道你们以前
否决过这个猜想
Okay,I know that you've 
all dismissed this theory before.

16
00:00:43,318 --> 00:00:45,946
但Carl有可能是吸血鬼吗?
But is there any chance that Carl is a vampire?

17
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,197
不, 伙计们, 我是认真的
想想有没可能
no,you guys,I'm serious.Think about it.

18
00:00:49,331 --> 00:00:50,175
他总是穿黑色的衣服
He always wears black.

19
00:00:50,377 --> 00:00:52,381
我们从来没在白天
见过他, 只有傍晚后
We never see him in the daylight,only after dark.

20
00:00:52,515 --> 00:00:53,494
噢, 天那
Oh,my god.

21
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:58,999
确实形容的象吸血鬼...
或者, 你们知道, 是酒吧调酒师
That does describe a vampire... 
or,you know,a bartender.

22
00:00:59,507 --> 00:01:00,811
我得去打扮了
Well, I should go get dressed.

23
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:02,192
你要去哪, 伙计? 约会?
Where you going,buddy?Hot date?

24
00:01:02,336 --> 00:01:04,858
我来说, 她要和一个
身家数十亿的富翁约会
I'll say.She's going out with a billionaire.

25
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:06,594
我说了不要那样称呼他
I told you not to call him that.

26
00:01:06,748 --> 00:01:08,311
等等, 你真要和
身家数十亿的富翁约会?
Wait,you're really going out with a billionaire?

27
00:01:08,503 --> 00:01:09,279
他不是身家数十亿
He's not a billionaire.

28
00:01:09,414 --> 00:01:10,267
他是身家数亿
He's a hundred-millionaire.

29
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:11,696
为什么人们总是分不清楚呢?
Why do people always round up?

30
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:15,082
那么, 呃
Thurston Howell要带你去哪?
So,uh,where's Thurston Howell taking you?

31
00:01:15,197 --> 00:01:15,791
一个慈善晚会
A charity dinner.

32
00:01:15,983 --> 00:01:17,777
对, 2,000块一个盘子
Yeah,$2,000 a plate.

33
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,714
是1,500 别再弄错了
$1,500. Stop rounding up.

34
00:01:20,117 --> 00:01:21,603
是为第三世界的饥民办的
And it's for third world hunger.

35
00:01:21,757 --> 00:01:23,166
你要献身吗?
You gonna put out?

36
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,893
什么? 只有一个原因
What?There's only one reason

37
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:26,005
他才会带她去那个晚会
he's taking her to this dinner,

38
00:01:26,245 --> 00:01:27,386
而且这绝不是因为小富翁
and it's not so little Mu Tu

39
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,563
需要人服侍喝疟疾药
can get his malaria pills.

40
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:33,984
刚才我的灵魂呕吐了
I think my soul just threw up a little bit.

41
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:35,116
嗯, 我要迟到了
Well,I'm gonna be late.

42
00:01:35,241 --> 00:01:36,123
你们玩的开心点
You guys have fun.

43
00:01:36,276 --> 00:01:38,597
- 拜 回头见
- 拜 回头见
-Bye. See ya. 
-Bye.See ya.

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,547
你还好吧?
You okay?

45
00:01:39,556 --> 00:01:40,851
当然 为什么这么问?
Sure. Why?

46
00:01:41,292 --> 00:01:42,357
噢, 我不知道
Oh,I don't know.

47
00:01:42,472 --> 00:01:44,908
你的梦中情人和一个
身家数十亿的富翁约会
Girl of your dreams dating a billionaire.

48
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,804
好吧, 首先, 他身家数亿
Okay,first of all,hundred-millionaire.

49
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:49,348
其次 她不是我的梦中情人
And second,she's not the girl of my dream. 

50
00:01:49,559 --> 00:01:51,822
我们只是朋友
we're just friends.

51
00:01:51,966 --> 00:01:53,568
听着, 如果我们在一起
是不明智的
Look,it would not be smart if we got together.

52
00:01:53,721 --> 00:01:54,680
我是说, 我希望一切安定下来
I mean,I'm looking to settle down,

53
00:01:54,795 --> 00:01:55,761
她希望的是...
she's looking for... 

54
00:01:57,776 --> 00:01:59,946
什么?你说完了? 太好了
wha...? You done? Great.

55
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,868
看那边4号桌
Check out table number four.

56
00:02:04,089 --> 00:02:05,882
看到最后那个小辣妹了吗?
See that little hottie on the end?

57
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,049
她有点矮, 但胸够大
She's short,but has an ample bosom.

58
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,399
我喜欢  她就象个半个乳房
I love it. She's,like,half boob.

59
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,435
我们过去
Let's go.

60
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,154
嗯, 然后说什么?
Yeah,and say what?

61
00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:14,082
我们的开场白是什么?
What's our big opening line?

62
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:17,812
我... 呃... 爹地回家了
I... uh... daddy's home.

63
00:02:18,628 --> 00:02:19,299
爹地回家了?
Daddy's home?

64
00:02:19,443 --> 00:02:19,932
对
Yeah.

65
00:02:20,047 --> 00:02:22,358
好吧, 你希望我们现在过去
Okay,you want us to go over there right now

66
00:02:22,521 --> 00:02:25,216
然后跟那些女生说
"爹地回家了"?
and say to those girls,"daddy's home"?

67
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,182
认真想清楚点, Barney
Really think about that,Barney.

68
00:02:27,345 --> 00:02:30,846
嗯 耶, 我觉得很不错
Hmm. Yeah,I think it's pretty solid.

69
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,572
好吧, 想下这个
Okay,think about this.

70
00:02:32,706 --> 00:02:34,461
菜单里有任何
Is there even a single item

71
00:02:34,605 --> 00:02:36,485
放了大蒜的菜吗?
on the menu that has garlic in it?

72
00:02:36,638 --> 00:02:37,770
大蒜炸薯条
Garlic fries.

73
00:02:38,537 --> 00:02:40,235
好吧, 嗯, 我再想想
Okay,well,I'll get back to you.

74
00:02:41,031 --> 00:02:43,783
噢, 爹地回来了
Oh,daddy's back. 

75
00:02:43,965 --> 00:02:45,557
看吧, 如果你有认真想想...
See,if you'd taken a moment to think about that...

76
00:02:45,673 --> 00:02:46,862
那么爹地就不可能拿到
then daddy wouldn't have gotten this

77
00:02:46,986 --> 00:02:50,736
这个7位数的父亲节卡片了
……来自于Amy的
seven-digit father's day card from Amy.

78
00:02:51,273 --> 00:02:52,654
啊 那管用吗?
Ah. That worked?

79
00:02:52,808 --> 00:02:53,594
我恨这个世界
I hate the world.

80
00:02:53,728 --> 00:02:56,375
Ted, 你的问题是每次
做什么都是考虑, 考虑, 考虑
Ted,your problem is 
all you do is think,think,think.

81
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,524
我在教你怎么
实践, 实践, 实践
I'm teaching you how to do,do,do.

82
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,118
do-do
（孩童用语“大便”）
Doo-doo.

83
00:02:59,339 --> 00:03:00,413
对啊
Totally.

84
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:01,823
我考虑很多
So I think a lot.

85
00:03:01,967 --> 00:03:03,818
因为我恰好有一个
很聪明的大脑
I happen to have a very powerful brain.

86
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,767
那不可能有用
It can't be helped.

87
00:03:04,911 --> 00:03:06,081
噢, 不, 它可以
Oh,yes,it can.

88
00:03:07,251 --> 00:03:08,584
有趣
Interesting.

89
00:03:08,757 --> 00:03:11,058
Ted, 我相信我们相遇
是有原因的
Ted,I believe you and I met for a reason.

90
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:13,408
就象上天在说, 嘿, Barney
It's like the universe was saying,"hey,Barney,

91
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:14,348
有个家伙 不错的家伙
"there's this dude-- he's pretty cool

92
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:16,889
但你的工作是让他变的很棒
but it's your job to make him awesome."

93
00:03:17,043 --> 00:03:18,232
你的脑把你给搞砸了, Ted
Your brain screws you up,Ted.

94
00:03:18,395 --> 00:03:19,086
一直这样
It gets in the way.

95
00:03:19,258 --> 00:03:20,083
Robin也是
It happened with Robin,

96
00:03:20,227 --> 00:03:21,761
半个乳房也是
it happened with half boob,

97
00:03:21,972 --> 00:03:23,864
这些事会一直发生
直到……
and it's gonna keep on 
happening until you power down

98
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:28,283
你用酒医治你的神经妄想症
that bucket of neuroses inebriation-style.

99
00:03:28,494 --> 00:03:30,508
那么, 怎么, 你想我喝一杯吗?
So,what,you want me to do a shot?

100
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,557
噢, 不 我想要你把五杯都喝了
Oh,no. I want you to do five shots.

101
00:03:33,864 --> 00:03:35,926
喔 喔 更加有趣了
Ooh.Ooh. More interesting.

102
00:03:36,137 --> 00:03:38,477
Barney, 我觉得你...
Barney,I think you've officially...

103
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:40,558
不, 别考虑了 喝吧
no,don't think. Do.

104
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,177
Ted, 他是对的 你想太多了
Ted,he's right: You overthink.

105
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,459
也许你应该多喝点
Maybe you should overdrink.

106
00:03:45,862 --> 00:03:48,557
喝, 喝... 喝
喝, 喝...
Drink,drink... drink,
drink,drink... drin drink,drink...

107
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,206
呃, Lily, 你来告诉
他们这事有多蠢?
uh,Lily,will you tell these 
guys how stupid they're being?

108
00:03:50,504 --> 00:03:52,585
伙计, 你们太不成熟和愚蠢了
Guys,you are being immature and moronic,

109
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:54,781
……还有喝, 喝... 噢!
……and drink,drink... oh!

110
00:03:54,973 --> 00:04:01,657
喝... 喝...
Drink,drink,ink... drink,drink,drink...

111
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:04,439
让我来告诉你一点
关于这大脑的事, 好吗?
Let me tell you something about this brain,okay?

112
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:09,042
酒精不能让
这脑袋停止思考
Mere alcohol cannot stop this brain.

113
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:10,317
喝... 我喜欢这个!
Drink,drink... I love it!

114
00:04:10,461 --> 00:04:11,487
我喜欢这个! 我喜欢这个!
I love it! I love it!

115
00:04:11,756 --> 00:04:14,854
这大脑, 亲爱的凡人们
这不是普通的大脑
This brain,dear mortals,is no ordinary brain.

116
00:04:15,007 --> 00:04:18,517
喝... 这是超级大脑
Drink,drink... this is a super brain.

117
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,826
是不可能被阻止思考的
this brain is unstoppable.

118
00:04:22,018 --> 00:04:22,516
这大脑...
This brain...

119
00:04:22,881 --> 00:04:24,588
这就是所有我记得的了
and that's all I remember.

120
00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:26,976
除了一些模糊的记忆
Except for a few other hazy memories.

121
00:04:37,928 --> 00:04:39,463
但真的, 下面我记得的
But really,the next thing I remember

122
00:04:39,664 --> 00:04:41,103
就是第二天早晨醒来的事了
was waking up the following morning, 

123
00:04:41,104 --> 00:04:45,300

125
00:05:00,861 --> 00:05:03,413
所以就有好多
亟待解答的问题了
so there were some unanswered questions.

126
00:05:03,652 --> 00:05:04,755
我喝了多少?
How much did I drink?

127
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:06,865
我怎么弄伤脚踝的?
How did I sprain my ankle?

128
00:05:10,461 --> 00:05:12,821
在我床上的女孩是谁?
Who was this girl in my bed?

129
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:15,775
我们的摇滚明星来了
There's our rock star.

130
00:05:16,005 --> 00:05:18,489
好吧, 呃... 昨晚
到底发生了什么?
Okay,uh... what the hell happened last night?

131
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:21,270
你真的都不记得了吗
超级大脑?
You really don't remember,superbrain?

132
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:24,444
Marshall叔叔和Lily阿姨
补上了我的记忆
So uncle Marshall and aunt Lilly filled me in.

133
00:05:24,588 --> 00:05:26,276
你们觉得这酒怎么样?
And how did you guys like the shots?

134
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,319
我把五杯都喝完了, 婊子
I drank all five,bitch.

135

我喜欢喝醉的Ted

Marshall认为你是吸血鬼

137
00:05:35,646 --> 00:05:37,027
好吧, 如果他吐了
all right,if he pukes,

138
00:05:37,267 --> 00:05:38,945
你们之一要清理干净
one of you guys cleans it up.

139
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:40,393
不是我
No dibs.

140
00:05:40,527 --> 00:05:42,618
噢 不是... 该死! 耶
Oh. No D... damn it! Yes.

141
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:44,450
我忘了你有多快了
How quickly you l forget.

142
00:05:44,613 --> 00:05:45,984
从高中起我就没吐过了
I haven't puked since high school.

143
00:05:46,186 --> 00:05:48,574
我从93年起就没吐过了

144
00:05:48,746 --> 00:05:53,024
93年起, 免吐王

Vomit-free since 93. That's funny.I'm funny!

145
00:05:53,254 --> 00:05:54,318
你在给谁打电话?
Who are you calling?

146
00:05:54,338 --> 00:05:54,894
Robin

147
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,419
噢, 坏主意

148
00:05:56,563 --> 00:05:57,637
不, 不, 这是个好主意
No,no,it's a great idea.

149
00:05:57,781 --> 00:05:59,286
这就是为什么要喝醉的重点
That's the whole point of getting drunk.

150
00:05:59,468 --> 00:06:01,530
你可以做一些清醒时候
不可能做的事情
You do things you'd never do if you were sober.

151
00:06:01,713 --> 00:06:04,849
-援引你睡过的女人的话
-说的好
Says every girl you've ever slept with.Say what?

152
00:06:07,246 --> 00:06:08,512
喂, Robin 我是Ted

153

噢, 嗨, Ted

154
00:06:09,797 --> 00:06:11,993
你好, Robin 我是Ted

155
00:06:12,137 --> 00:06:14,525
嗨, Ted听起来你兴致很高

156
00:06:14,736 --> 00:06:16,386
Robin, 我有告诉过你
Robin,have I ever told you that

157
00:06:16,549 --> 00:06:18,659
我从93年就没吐过?
I am vomit-free since 93?

158
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:23,694
听着, Ted, 我现在
不方便聊... 93年?
Listen,Ted,I can't really talk right... 93?

159
00:06:23,838 --> 00:06:25,228
伙计, 这很让人惊讶
Dude,that's impressive.

160
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,935
Robin, 我永远也说不够
Robin,I don't say this enough,

161
00:06:27,127 --> 00:06:29,410
但你确实是个不错的女人
和伟大的记者
but you're a great woman,and a great reporter.

162
00:06:29,573 --> 00:06:31,088
你应该上“60分钟”
（CBS著名新闻节目）
You should be on 60 minutes.

163
00:06:31,241 --> 00:06:32,939
你应该是那些分钟的一员
You should be one of the minutes.

164
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,305
这很让人高兴... 和奇怪
That's sweet... and odd.

165
00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:37,830
但我现在正在约会
But I'm kind of on a date right now.

166
00:06:37,974 --> 00:06:39,384
对, 我不同意Barney的观点
Yeah,and I disagree with Barney.

167
00:06:39,518 --> 00:06:41,110
那家伙花了很多钱
Just cause this guy's spending a lot of money

168
00:06:41,254 --> 00:06:42,932
并不代表你得献身
doesn't mean you have to put out.

169
00:06:43,095 --> 00:06:44,620
放慢点进度, Robin
Take it slow,Robin.

170
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,509
放慢点
Take it slow.

171
00:06:47,104 --> 00:06:49,425
慢点... 拜, Ted
Slow... bye,Ted.

172
00:06:49,626 --> 00:06:52,302
-慢点... 
-哇, 对了
Slow... wow,right.

173
00:06:52,475 --> 00:06:54,345
这就是为什么我们不喝
That's why we don't do shots.

174
00:06:54,546 --> 00:06:56,992
朋友不会让朋友
喝醉然后打电话
Friends don't let friends drink and dial.

175
00:06:57,164 --> 00:06:58,363
我要拿回电话
I need that phone back.

176
00:06:58,507 --> 00:07:00,109
你会在下课的时候拿到的
You'll get this back at the end of class.

177
00:07:00,358 --> 00:07:01,883
叮 下课了
你的电话, 小朋友
Ding.Class dismissed.Here you go,kid.

178
00:07:02,151 --> 00:07:03,705
你给谁打电话都行
You call whoever you want.

179
00:07:03,887 --> 00:07:04,875
谢谢, 好心的老师
Thank you,kind sir.

180
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:06,831
至少有人欣赏我
At least someone appreciates the fact that

181
00:07:07,042 --> 00:07:08,941
行动，而不是考虑
I am doing and not thinking.

182
00:07:09,114 --> 00:07:11,147
还有现在, 我不会想
And now,I don't think I won't

183
00:07:11,368 --> 00:07:13,554
我不去厕所
not go to the bathroom.

184
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:15,798
这有必要吗?
Was that necessary?

185
00:07:15,952 --> 00:07:17,745
他不是在做明智的决定
He is not making smart decisions.

186
00:07:17,966 --> 00:07:19,443
完全正确，就象
他下一步要做什么?
Exactly.It's like,what's he gonna do next?

187
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,553
我不知道, 但我要找出来
I don't know,but I want to find out.

188
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,067
烂把戏?
cheap trick?

189
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:29,417
噢, Ted
Oh,Ted.

190
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:33,310
又见了, Ted
hello again,Ted.

191
00:07:33,972 --> 00:07:37,434
嘿，我又来了
Hey,it's me again

192
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,884
清晰的再次相见
plain to see again

193
00:07:43,457 --> 00:07:48,061
求求你，能不能每天与你见面
please,can I see you every day

194
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:50,333
我爱这里每个人!
I love everyone in this bar!

195
00:07:50,602 --> 00:07:52,769
我们也爱你,醉Ted!
we love you,drunk Ted!

196
00:07:53,335 --> 00:07:56,462
我又一次成了笨蛋
I'm a fool again

197
00:07:57,785 --> 00:07:59,818
我又落入了爱……
I fell lo... ve.

198
00:08:01,056 --> 00:08:01,688
Ted?
Ted?

199
00:08:02,628 --> 00:08:04,000
嗯, 这就解释了为什么脚踝痛
Well,that explainthe ankle.

200
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,397
后来我们把你带回家睡觉
Then we brought you home and put you to bed.

201
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:09,457
有别的人和我一起回来吗?
Was there anyone else in there with me?

202
00:08:19,843 --> 00:08:21,013
嘘 有个女的在里面!
Shh.Thers a girl in there!

203

00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:23,852
我知道
I know.

206
00:08:24,111 --> 00:08:24,773
她是谁?
Who is she?

207
00:08:24,926 --> 00:08:25,991
不知道
I don't know.

208
00:08:28,398 --> 00:08:29,808
我的夹克怎么了?
What the hell happened to my jacket?

209
00:08:30,182 --> 00:08:31,428
哇
Whoa.

210
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,178
里面那女的还活着, 是不?
That girl in there is alive,right?

211
00:08:36,137 --> 00:08:36,885
我得给Barney打个电话
I should call Barney.

212
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:38,381
可能他知道发生什么了
Maybe he knows what happened.

213
00:08:56,478 --> 00:08:57,409
喂
Hello.

214
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,097
你干嘛睡在我们的浴缸里?
Why are you sleeping in our tub?

215
00:08:59,298 --> 00:09:02,875
呃, 陶瓷保持西装不变皱

216
00:09:03,163 --> 00:09:05,321
等等, 我昨天半夜上厕所
Wait,were you here when I went to the bathroom

217
00:09:05,474 --> 00:09:06,385
你也在这儿？
in the middle of the night?

218
00:09:06,414 --> 00:09:06,999
别担心
Don't worry.

219
00:09:07,076 --> 00:09:08,418
我睡着了
I slept through it.

220
00:09:08,706 --> 00:09:11,574
事实上我没睡着
I totally didn't sleep through it.

221
00:09:12,034 --> 00:09:15,362
噢, 哇, 你身材这么娇小
看不出容量这么大
Oh,and wow,for a little girl,you got a big tank.

222
00:09:16,158 --> 00:09:17,386
你到底怎么进来的?
How did you get in here anyway?

223
00:09:17,597 --> 00:09:18,910
我们大概一点钟
把Ted弄上床的
We put Ted to bed around 1:00.

224
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,605

236
00:09:50,655 --> 00:09:51,153
哼?

是做事时间了
It's do o'clock.

我们走吧
Let's ride.

250
00:10:26,034 --> 00:10:27,894

我床上那女的是谁?

和一个菠萝

菠萝感兴趣的吗?
Am I the only one who's 
curious about the pineapple?

261
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:02,410

我吐了吗? 噢, 我的记录没了
I threw up? Oh,my streak is over.

290
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:19,331
05年起免吐王
听起来一点都不棒
Vomit-free since 05 doesn't sound good.

291
00:12:19,858 --> 00:12:22,064
抱歉, Carl 继续
Sorry,Carl. Go on.

292
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:25,248
Carl... 你知道"卡拉OK"这个词
Carl... did you know the word "karaoke" is

293
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:28,327
是日语“无人伴奏的乐队”

294
00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:30,945
你说这个词是多么
美丽的萦绕心头
Isn't that hauntingly beautiful?

295
00:12:31,424 --> 00:12:33,477
你是吸血鬼吗?
Are you a vampire?

296
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,078
好吧, 我不会给你酒了
All right,I'm cutting you off.

297
00:12:35,328 --> 00:12:36,939
回家睡觉去, Ted

你的原形，是不？
Wouldn't want to be around for that,would we?

300
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,026
嘿, 你觉得溜进
Hey,how easy do you think it

301
00:12:44,189 --> 00:12:45,158
动物园容易吗?

我想看企鹅, 就现在

这样, 如果你醉倒在水沟里了
This way,if you pass out in the gutter

00:13:01,097 --> 00:13:02,056
我们不能只做朋友
We can't just be friends.

310
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,063
我们互相吸引
We're attracted to each other,

311
00:13:03,207 --> 00:13:04,444
我们都清楚
and we both know it.

312
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:05,883

317
00:13:18,552 --> 00:13:20,163
听着, 谁在开玩笑?
Look,who are we kidding?

318
00:13:20,345 --> 00:13:22,052
我们两个互相吸引
You and I are both attracted to each other.

319

我们年轻, 我们都醉了
……我们之一醉了
We-we're young,we're drunk-- half of us

320
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:26,454
不管怎样 生活只有一辈子
anyway-- and we only get one life.

321
00:13:26,656 --> 00:13:29,053
所以, 为什么你现在
不马上来我公寓呢
So,why don't you come 
over to my apartment right now,

322
00:13:29,274 --> 00:13:31,518
我们会找点蠢事来做?
and we'll think of 
something stupid to do together?

323
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,381
真的吗?

你们俩有没有...?
Did you guys...?

330
00:13:50,507 --> 00:13:51,130
噢, 拜托
Oh,come on.

331
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:52,128
怎么说你也一定要
和我来一下
You've got to give me this one.

332
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:53,796
那五杯酒让你和
Robin进展神速
Those five shots got you further with

333
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,657
这是你的脑袋永远做不到的
Robin than your brain ever did.

334
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,201
看你什么也不想的时候
发生了什么?
See what happens when you don't think?

335
00:13:57,412 --> 00:14:01,315
你做了! 更重要的是
你“做”了Robin
You do. More importantly,you do Robin.

336
00:14:01,555 --> 00:14:02,840

好吧, 这里
All right,right over here.

338
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,112
但, 呃, 这表示什么?
but,uh,still,what does this mean?

339
00:14:09,342 --> 00:14:10,417
我们要约会了吗?
Are we dating now?

340
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,277
我是说, 我从来没想过
事情会发展成这样
I-I mean,I never pictured it going down this way,

341
00:14:12,488 --> 00:14:13,754
但是可能这就是
事情该发展的方向
But maybe that's how it had to happen.

342
00:14:13,984 --> 00:14:14,512
我是说, 想想...
I mean,think about it...

343

有没有人给他拿点酒
他又开始考虑了
Someone get him a shot.He's thinking again.

344
00:14:16,935 --> 00:14:18,377
你知道吗?
You know what? Hold on,man.

345
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,947
想想这个问题也不是那么糟
Maybe it's not such a bad idea to think about this one.


346
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,750
你和Robin以前曾经历过

你们处理的相当糟糕

嘿, Robin, 你怎么样?

00:17:21,788 --> 00:17:24,579
我猜你会给我打电话
Then I guess you're gonna have to call me.

413
00:17:26,132 --> 00:17:28,012
我得再打个电话
I got to make one more call.

414
00:17:29,326 --> 00:17:30,601
喂?
Hello?

415
00:17:30,908 --> 00:17:32,932
-嘿, 又是我
-嘿
Hey,it's me again. Hey.

416
00:17:33,124 --> 00:17:34,543
听着, 谁在开玩笑?
Look,who are we kidding?

417
00:17:34,716 --> 00:17:36,528
我们俩互相吸引
You and I are both attracted to each other.

418
00:17:36,758 --> 00:17:39,209
我们年轻, 我们醉了
……我们之一喝醉了
We're-we're young,we're drunk-- half of us,

419
00:17:39,502 --> 00:17:41,016
生活只有一辈子
anyway-- and we only get one life.

420
00:17:41,199 --> 00:17:43,069
所以, 我到这来了
So,I came over here.

421
00:17:43,491 --> 00:17:46,627
现在, 我真的, 真的很尴尬
And now,I'm really,really embarrassed.

422
00:17:47,912 --> 00:17:48,555
该死, Trudy!
Damn it,Trudy!

423
00:17:48,756 --> 00:17:50,367
菠萝是怎么回事?
What about the pineapple?

424
00:17:50,684 --> 00:17:52,074
抱歉 抱歉 抱歉!
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry!

425
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:56,668
啊, Robin来了
ah,Robin's here.

426
00:17:56,841 --> 00:17:59,651
呃, 听着, Trudy
我需要你藏在卧室
Um,look,Trudy,I need you to hide in my bedroom.

427
00:17:59,842 --> 00:18:00,945
为什么? 是你女朋友吗?
Why? Is that your girlfriend?

428
00:18:01,137 --> 00:18:02,096
啊, 不, 那不是我女朋友
Ah,no,that's not my girlfriend.

429
00:18:02,288 --> 00:18:03,640
呃, 听着, 这很复杂
Um,look,it's complicated.

430
00:18:03,813 --> 00:18:05,702
噢, 你结婚了, 耶, 我知道
我不敢相信我这么做了
Oh,you're married.
Yeah,I know.I can't believe I did this.

431
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:06,978
不, 不, 不, 我没结婚
No,no,no,I-I'm not married.

432
00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:09,155
呃... 你藏起来后我会解释
Um... I'll explain after you hide.

433
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:16,530
嘿 嗨, 伙计们
Hey. Hi,guys.

434
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,026
嘿, Robin, 早上好
嗨
Hey,Robin,top of the morning.Hi.

435
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,656
嗨, Robin 不错的毛衣
Hi,Robin.Good sweater.

436
00:18:20,203 --> 00:18:23,080
呃, 抱歉我一直
那样给你打电话
Um,sorry I kept calling you like that.

437
00:18:23,281 --> 00:18:24,806
我太醉了
I was pretty drunk.

438
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,900
呃, 别开玩笑了
Uh,no kidding.

439
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:27,837
那些电话太奇怪了
Those calls were really weird.

440
00:18:28,326 --> 00:18:30,560
听着, Ted, 也许我们该谈谈
Look,Ted,maybe we need to talk.

441
00:18:30,925 --> 00:18:32,076
我们去吃点东西
Let's go get a snack.

442
00:18:32,239 --> 00:18:33,390
我喜欢吃东西
I love to snack.

443
00:18:33,553 --> 00:18:34,799
我不用了
I'm good.

444
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,683
拜托, 那些电话没那么怪
Come on,those calls weren't that weird.

445
00:18:47,296 --> 00:18:49,300
Robin! 出来!
Robin! Come hang out!

446
00:18:49,492 --> 00:18:52,273
好吧, 我要继续发出
这种声音直到你出来
Okay,I'm gonna make 
this sound till you come hang out.

447
00:18:52,407 --> 00:18:56,541
啊....
Aaah....

448
00:18:58,018 --> 00:19:00,636
这持续了三分半钟
that goes on for three and a half minutes.

449
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:01,605
没有换气吗?
Without a breath?

450
00:19:01,739 --> 00:19:03,743
这应该可以成世界纪录了
That's got to be some kind of record.

451
00:19:03,906 --> 00:19:05,604
噢, Ted, 你不能这样
Oh,Ted,you can't do this.

452
00:19:05,767 --> 00:19:06,975
求你了 我们答应了做朋友
Please.We agreed to be friends,

453
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:09,008
但现在你把一切都弄乱了
and now you're making it all confusing.

454
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:09,872
不, 我没有
No,I'm not.

455
00:19:10,054 --> 00:19:12,461
听着, 我只是让我的大脑
休息了一晚
Look,I-I just turned off my brain for the night.

456
00:19:12,662 --> 00:19:13,142
没有什么改变了
Nothing's changed.

457
00:19:13,161 --> 00:19:14,763
你继续过你的 我继续过我的
You've moved on.I've moved on.

458
00:19:15,012 --> 00:19:16,997
你真的没想了吗?
Really,you've moved on?

459
00:19:17,151 --> 00:19:19,308
是啊 什么, 你不相信我吗?
Yes. What,you don't believe me?

460
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,929
噢 呃, 好吧
oh. Uh,okay.

461
00:19:22,445 --> 00:19:24,583
Trudy, 出来吧
Trudy,come on out.

462
00:19:24,765 --> 00:19:26,223
你会笑出来的
You are gonna laugh.

463
00:19:26,444 --> 00:19:27,997
等等 你昨晚和某人在一起?
Wait. You were with someone last night?

464
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,654
是啊, Trudy 她不错
Yeah,Trudy. She's cool.

465
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,380
Trudy, 出来吧
Trudy,come on out.

466
00:19:32,917 --> 00:19:35,593
是啊, 真的, 没什么
Yeah,seriously,it's okay.

467
00:19:36,149 --> 00:19:40,646
这就是Trudy
她很害羞... 我觉得...
This is so Trudy.
She's really shy... I think... 

468
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:42,613
Trudy?
Trudy?

469
00:19:48,818 --> 00:19:50,784
嗨, Trudy 我是Robin
Hi,Trudy.I'm Robin.

470
00:19:50,928 --> 00:19:51,627
很高兴见到你
It's nice to meet you. 

471
00:19:53,115 --> 00:19:54,108
你是对的，她很害羞
She is shy.

472
00:19:55,129 --> 00:19:55,992
我不是编的
I'm not making this up.

473
00:19:56,116 --> 00:19:58,524
她一定从安全通道爬下去了
She-she must have climbed out the fire escape.

474
00:19:58,677 --> 00:20:00,077
不管怎样 不管怎样!
whatever. Whatever!

475
00:20:00,231 --> 00:20:01,919
我不在乎你怎么想
I-I don't care what you think.

476
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,412
那为什么你把她藏起来躲我?
Then why'd you hide her from me?

477
00:20:05,256 --> 00:20:06,714
哇 你很聪明
Wow. You're good.

478
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:09,150
有没人告诉你
你应该上60 minutes?
Anyone ever tell you you should be on 60 minutes?

479
00:20:09,351 --> 00:20:11,250
是的 你说过... 昨晚
Yes. You did... last night.

480
00:20:11,413 --> 00:20:12,786
真的？
Really.uh...

481
00:20:15,518 --> 00:20:16,812
睡一下吧, Ted
get some sleep,Ted.

482
00:20:17,052 --> 00:20:18,558
你过了个漫长的夜晚
You had a long night.

483
00:20:18,769 --> 00:20:20,188
别觉得糟糕
And don't feel bad.

484
00:20:20,342 --> 00:20:22,241
我有过更糟的
I've woken up with worse.

485
00:20:28,254 --> 00:20:29,405
我给Trudy留了言
I left Trudy a message,

486
00:20:29,577 --> 00:20:31,610
但她一直没有回电给我
but she never called me back.

487
00:20:31,793 --> 00:20:33,768
有些时候这就是生活
That's just how life works sometimes.

488
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,264
你关掉大脑一晚
You turn off your brain for a night,

489
00:20:35,466 --> 00:20:36,559
第二天你剩下的就是
and all your left with

490
00:20:36,684 --> 00:20:38,218
就是糟糕的宿醉
the next day is a bad hangover,

491
00:20:38,381 --> 00:20:40,108
扭伤的脚踝,和一个菠萝
a sprained ankle,and a pineapple.

492
00:20:41,249 --> 00:20:42,170
噢, 我们也一直不知道
Oh,we never found out

493
00:20:42,352 --> 00:20:43,886
那个菠萝是哪来的
where that pineapple came from,

494
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,823
但是它很可口
but it was delicious.

495
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,984
