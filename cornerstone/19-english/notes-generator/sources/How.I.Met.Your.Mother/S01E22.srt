老爸老妈浪漫史
第1季 第22集
How.I.Met.Your.Mother
Season 1 Episode 22

4
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,604
2006年5月的纽约
It was the May of 2006 in New York city

5
00:00:15,738 --> 00:00:17,119
不错的生活
and life was good.

6
00:00:17,244 --> 00:00:19,440
似乎将有所改变
But everything was about to change,

7
00:00:20,063 --> 00:00:23,372
...你们觉得如何?
So... what do you think?

8
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,961
又是Robin?
Robin again?

9
00:00:26,153 --> 00:00:26,882
Ted
Ted,

10
00:00:27,016 --> 00:00:31,303
这个宇宙明显不想让你和Robin在一起
the universe clearly does not want you and Robin to be together.

11
00:00:31,418 --> 00:00:32,560
不要触怒它
Don't piss off the universe.

12
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:34,497
宇宙会扇你的脸
The universe will slap you.

13
00:00:34,622 --> 00:00:37,575
相比于我的感情生活宇宙是不是要关注些更重要的?
Don't you think the universe has more important things to think about than my dating life?

14
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:41,738
除非你的感情生活是维系整个宇宙的关键...
Unless your dating life is the glue holding the entire universe together...

15
00:00:41,843 --> 00:00:43,052
哇...好冷
whoa. Chills.

16
00:00:43,195 --> 00:00:45,286
你们不觉得冷吗?
Anybody else get chills?

17
00:00:45,842 --> 00:00:48,921
我知道,我已经走过这条路
Look,I realize we've been down this road before,

18
00:00:49,055 --> 00:00:51,155
可是,不管我怎么走
but the fact is,whatever I do

19
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:53,006
都会回到Robin这里
it all keeps coming back to Robin,

20
00:00:53,141 --> 00:00:56,018
所以...我必须这样做
so... I gotta do this.

21
00:00:57,236 --> 00:00:58,741
搞什么?
Ow! What the hell?

22
00:00:58,866 --> 00:00:59,691
不是我
That wasn't me.

23
00:00:59,816 --> 00:01:01,360
是宇宙
That was the universe.

24
00:01:02,568 --> 00:01:04,582
值得一提的是,在这个非常时刻
the funny thing was at that very moment

25
00:01:04,745 --> 00:01:06,654
宇宙确实在做一件事--
the universe was working on something--

26
00:01:06,826 --> 00:01:07,843
风暴
a storm.

27
00:01:07,948 --> 00:01:09,924
热带风暴"威利"将来到我们身边
so tropical storm Willy is going to be with us

28
00:01:10,058 --> 00:01:11,660
最晚周一
at least until Monday.

29
00:01:11,967 --> 00:01:14,518
届时将有一场满天猫狗的大雨
It's gonna rain cats and dogs,folks.

30
00:01:14,633 --> 00:01:16,436
所以,小心别踩到狗狗
So don't step in a poodle.

31
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:17,913
Sandy? Robin?
Sandy? Robin?

32
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:18,929
谢谢,Lou
Thanks,Lou.

33
00:01:19,064 --> 00:01:19,879
呀,太糟了
Boy,too bad.

34
00:01:19,975 --> 00:01:22,804
这周末都市新闻1频道本来有个露营活动
Our Big Metro News One camping trip was going to be this weekend.

35
00:01:22,938 --> 00:01:25,854
是啊,冒着大雨露营? 算了吧 好脏啊...恶
Yeah,but camping out in the rain? No fun. Muddy. Yuck.

36
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:27,455
这次是真的要"因雨推迟"了
Guess we'll have to take a rain check.

37
00:01:27,551 --> 00:01:29,584
明天再和各位见,纽约
And we'll check in with you tomorrow,New York.

38
00:01:29,718 --> 00:01:31,224
有个愉快夜晚
Have a great night.

39
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:32,931
结束
And,we're clear.

40
00:01:33,056 --> 00:01:33,814
失败
Bummer.

41
00:01:33,948 --> 00:01:36,959
我本希望这个周末能和你上床,Scherbotsky.
I was hoping to finally have sex with you this weekend,Scherbotsky.

42
00:01:37,093 --> 00:01:39,846
有必要重申下"不和同事睡觉"的政策
Well,I'd give you the "I don't date coworkers" speech again,

43
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,761
上帝,这次请务必让这贱人记住啊
but,god,you must have that sum'bitch memorized by now.

44
00:01:42,896 --> 00:01:43,874
虽然有点可惜
Shame,though.

45
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,782
今晚的节目很带劲
It was a pretty hot show tonight.

46
00:01:45,945 --> 00:01:48,132
最后那一段我们一唱一和
The rhythmic give and take of our improvised banter there at the end

47
00:01:48,266 --> 00:01:50,664
令我血脉贲张
really got my freak juice flowing.

48
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:53,052
他说的有道理
Dude,he's right.

49
00:01:53,157 --> 00:01:56,658
你这样屡败屡战,什么时候是个头啊?
How many times do you have to watch this crash and burn before you say,"enough"?

50
00:01:56,792 --> 00:01:58,566
再一次,再多试一次
One more. One more time.

51
00:01:58,672 --> 00:02:00,935
再来一次惊天动地的浪漫表白
One more big,beautiful,stupid romantic gesture.

52
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:02,882
然后,不管她说什么,是或否
And then,whatever she says, yes or no,

53
00:02:03,016 --> 00:02:04,973
就这样了,如果她答应,固然好
that's it. If it's yes,great.

54
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:08,195
不答应,我就永远放弃Robin
If it's no,then I am done going after Robin forever.

55
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:11,552
惊天动地的浪漫表白是怎么样的?
So what's this big,beautiful romantic gesture?

56
00:02:11,686 --> 00:02:13,652
我要给她准备一份...
I am going to make her...

57
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,203
混音CD
a mix CD.

58
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,927
不,开玩笑的,我心里有数
No,I'm kidding. I got a plan.

59
00:02:19,061 --> 00:02:20,730
Lily,我需要Robin公寓的备用钥匙
Lily,I'm gonna need the spare key to Robin's apartment.

60
00:02:20,922 --> 00:02:22,207
我知道怎么回事了
I see where this is going.

61
00:02:22,303 --> 00:02:26,446
Ted,涂满奶油躺在女孩的床上 是没有用的
Ted,waiting naked in a girl's bed wearing whipped cream undies does not work

62
00:02:27,165 --> 00:02:28,249
...也有例外
... usually.

63
00:02:28,383 --> 00:02:30,253
场地: Martha的葡萄园,1999年
The setting--Martha's vineyard,1999.

64
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:34,166
角色: 在下和一位黑发的国际交换生 她的名字叫...
The characters: Yours truly and a raven-haired au pair by the name...

65
00:02:34,463 --> 00:02:35,585
宇宙
universe.

66
00:02:36,314 --> 00:02:38,482
你这计划到底怎么样的?
So,this plan you speak of?

67
00:02:38,645 --> 00:02:41,426
记不记得我和Robin第一次出去?
Remember the first night Robin and I went out?

68
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,526
我给她偷了一个圆号
I stole a blue French horn for her

69
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,965
差点就得手了
and it almost worked.

70
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,279
是啊,哥们
Yeah. Dude,

71
00:02:46,413 --> 00:02:47,391
那招很牛
that was awesome,

72
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:49,760
你怎么可能超越那次?
but how are you ever going to top that?

73
00:02:54,996 --> 00:02:56,243
她很快就到了
She should be here any second.

74
00:02:57,221 --> 00:02:58,708
呃...我们很饿
Uh,we're pretty hungry.

75
00:02:58,823 --> 00:03:00,261
你什么时候给我们叫匹萨?
When do we get our pizza?

76
00:03:00,396 --> 00:03:03,417
不要老是...我们迟些会要匹萨的,好不好?
Enough with the... we'll go get pizza later,all right?

77
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:04,788
只要...
Just...

78
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,764
妈的
Damn it.

79
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:24,621
喂
hello.

80
00:03:24,717 --> 00:03:26,434
嗨,Lily,我被锁在房门外了
Hey,Lily,I'm locked out of my apartment.

81
00:03:26,568 --> 00:03:28,505
我到你那里去拿备用钥匙
I need to come pick up my extra key.

82
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:30,730
备用钥匙?
Extra key?

83
00:03:31,766 --> 00:03:33,732
我有你家的备用钥匙?
Do I have an extra key to your apartment?

84
00:03:33,866 --> 00:03:35,142
有,我给你的
Yes,I gave it to you.

85
00:03:35,247 --> 00:03:36,849
哦,对啊...钥匙
Oh,right. That key.

86
00:03:37,021 --> 00:03:38,489
我弄丢了
Yeah,I lost it.

87
00:03:38,757 --> 00:03:40,522
完了,只能找锁匠了
Great,now I gotta go to the locksmith.

88
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,402
不,等等...
No,wait,uh...

89
00:03:42,872 --> 00:03:44,444
你可以试试敲门
maybe you should just knock.

90
00:03:44,675 --> 00:03:45,988
敲门?
Knock?

91
00:03:46,113 --> 00:03:48,213
Lily,我的狗还没那么能干
Lily,my dogs aren't that well trained.

92
00:03:53,383 --> 00:03:57,852
你好Lily,我是旧金山拉塞尔艺术基金会的Janet Kagan
hello,Lily,this is Janet Kagan at the Russell House Art Foundation here in San Francisco.

我已经说过了
I've sort of said this already.

104
00:04:35,782 --> 00:04:36,904
差不多说出来了
I mean I've half said it.

105
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:39,465
我想说,就是说的很差
I've tried to say it,and I've said it badly.

106
00:04:39,723 --> 00:04:42,179
所以我来了,来向你说
So this is me,just saying it.

107
00:04:42,744 --> 00:04:44,452
弦乐伴奏
With strings.

108
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,811
我为你痴迷
I'm crazy about you.

109
00:04:46,926 --> 00:04:48,719
我认为我们应该在一起
I think we should be together.

110
00:04:49,151 --> 00:04:50,618
你说怎么样?
What do you say?

111
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,137
你说怎么样?

112
00:04:59,242 --> 00:04:59,943

113
00:05:00,048 --> 00:05:00,988
不好
No.

114
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:02,762
不知道
I don't know.

115
00:05:02,887 --> 00:05:04,105
这三个是备选
Those are the three options.

116
00:05:04,335 --> 00:05:05,313
Ted,这有点太...
Ted,this is so...

117
00:05:05,457 --> 00:05:06,109
我知道
I know.

118
00:05:06,234 --> 00:05:09,418
我回家准备看电视"Jeopardy"
I come home,I was going to watch Jeopardy

119
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:11,739
结果家里有一个弦乐四重奏而且...
and there's a string quartet and...

120
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,494
我要尿尿
I have to pee.

121
00:05:14,338 --> 00:05:15,911
哦,不好意思
Oh,I'm sorry.

122
00:05:16,217 --> 00:05:18,826
去吧...我们...我们等你
Un,go ahead. we'll...uh, we'll wait

123
00:05:30,488 --> 00:05:32,291
我们事先说好的是...
Yeah,cause when we talked earlier,

124
00:05:32,387 --> 00:05:33,662
你说了有匹萨的
you said there'd be pizza.

125
00:05:33,797 --> 00:05:37,307
不,我说结束之后有匹萨
No,I said I'd get you a pizza afterwards.

126
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:38,880
你看,能不能暂时不谈这个?
Look,could we talk about this later?

127
00:05:39,014 --> 00:05:41,172
我的爱情正在紧要关头
I'm sort of professing my love here.

128
00:05:41,373 --> 00:05:42,217
当然
Sure.

129
00:05:44,058 --> 00:05:45,804
不会有什么匹萨了
We're not getting any pizza.

130
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:48,825
好了
Okay.

131
00:05:49,746 --> 00:05:51,059
我们谈谈
let's talk.

132
00:05:51,194 --> 00:05:52,105
好的
Okay.

133
00:05:54,109 --> 00:05:54,991
嗯...
Um...

134
00:05:55,183 --> 00:05:57,149
你们要不要休息一下?
oh,hey,you guys want to take five?

135
00:05:58,732 --> 00:06:00,506
谢谢各位,只要一小会儿
Thanks,guys. Just need a minute.

136
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,849
面临重大决定
Sort of a big life decision.

137
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,719
不过我喜欢蓝色乐器
Love the blue instruments,though.

138
00:06:03,853 --> 00:06:05,205
我们的内部笑话
Kind of an inside joke.

139
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,644
谢谢
Thanks.

140
00:06:08,706 --> 00:06:09,435
你疯了
You're crazy.

141
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,394
是的
Right.

142
00:06:10,557 --> 00:06:11,324
别这样
Come on.

143
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:13,693
我也不是没想过
It's not that I haven't thought about this.

144
00:06:13,817 --> 00:06:14,642
你知道我想过的
You know that I have,

145
00:06:14,738 --> 00:06:15,956
让我们面对现实好不好?
but let's look at this,okay?

146
00:06:16,081 --> 00:06:18,181
我们刚开始恢复朋友关系
We only just started being friends again.

147
00:06:18,315 --> 00:06:20,742
我知道...可是...
I know. But... come on.

148
00:06:20,905 --> 00:06:22,410
我们要的东西不一样
And we want different things.

149
00:06:22,545 --> 00:06:24,674
这一点没有改变,还是老样子
That's still there. That's not going away.

150
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:25,949
如果我们这么做了
I mean,what if we do this

151
00:06:26,084 --> 00:06:26,899
结果却不如意
and it doesn't work out

152
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:29,037
连朋友都做不成了?
and I'd lose you as a friend?

153
00:06:29,172 --> 00:06:30,610
我要好好考虑
I gotta think about this.

154
00:06:30,744 --> 00:06:31,857
好吧,没问题
Okay,fine.

155
00:06:31,953 --> 00:06:32,998
在飞机上考虑吧
Think about it on the plane.

156
00:06:33,104 --> 00:06:34,130
我们这个周末去巴黎
Let's go to Paris for the weekend.

157
00:06:34,226 --> 00:06:35,022
我说真的
I'm serious.

158
00:06:35,118 --> 00:06:35,808
玩笑
I'm kidding.

159
00:06:35,914 --> 00:06:36,460
真的
I'm serious.

160
00:06:36,566 --> 00:06:38,887
我不能去巴黎,我要去野营
I can't go to Paris,I'm going camping.

161
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:40,297
我以为取消了
I thought that thing was canceled.

162
00:06:40,402 --> 00:06:41,121
现在又恢复了
Well,it's back on.

163
00:06:41,256 --> 00:06:41,908
什么时候的事?
Since when?

164
00:06:42,042 --> 00:06:43,423
大约1小时前
Since like an hour ago.

165
00:06:43,845 --> 00:06:47,115
...把风暴推回了大西洋
...Sending the storm back out into the Atlantic.

166
00:06:47,288 --> 00:06:50,098
周末将是晴空万里
So it's blue skies this weekend.

167
00:06:50,328 --> 00:06:51,642
Sandy? Robin?
Sandy? Robin?

168
00:06:51,747 --> 00:06:56,850
谢谢Lou,但还是有一点小小的乌云
Thanks,Lou,but that blue sky isn't without at least one cloud.

169
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:58,806
我很遗憾地宣布,从今天开始一周后
I'm sorry to announce that one week from today

170
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,367
我将离开都市新闻1频道
I will be leaving Metro News One.

171
00:07:01,568 --> 00:07:03,793
每晚为大家播报新闻是我的荣幸
It has been an honor to bring you the news each night,

172
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:06,085
早晨读报纸也是
and read the paper to you each morning.

173
00:07:06,545 --> 00:07:08,310
我会珍惜这段经历
I will always treasure it.

174
00:07:08,444 --> 00:07:10,046
晚安,纽约
Good night,New York.

175
00:07:10,219 --> 00:07:11,782
结束
And we're clear.

176
00:07:11,954 --> 00:07:12,866
你要走?
You're leaving?

177
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:15,062
没错,我辞工不干了
There. I quit my job.

178
00:07:15,225 --> 00:07:15,982
现在我们不是同事
We're not coworkers.

179
00:07:16,117 --> 00:07:18,342
这下你能和我一起吃晚饭了吧?
Will you please have dinner with me?

180
00:07:19,358 --> 00:07:19,914
我说笑的
I'm joking.

181
00:07:20,049 --> 00:07:21,583
我在CNN找到工作了
I got offered a job at CNN.

182
00:07:21,717 --> 00:07:23,031
哦,恭喜
Oh,congratulations.

183
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:25,045
也恭喜你
Congratulations yourself.

184
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:25,995
什么意思?
What do you mean?

185
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:26,676
这样的
Well,

186
00:07:26,848 --> 00:07:30,291
Joel问我谁可以接我的班做主播
Joel asked me who I thought should replace me as lead anchor.

187
00:07:30,464 --> 00:07:32,363
我告诉他是你
I told him you.

188
00:07:32,698 --> 00:07:35,317
他们下周会宣布,装的惊讶点
They're announcing it next week. Act surprised.

189
00:07:35,518 --> 00:07:36,985
哇哦
Wow.

190
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,827
谢谢
Thanks.

191
00:07:39,968 --> 00:07:41,090
还有,好的
And,yes.

192
00:07:41,224 --> 00:07:42,040
什么好的?
Yes,what?

193
00:07:42,203 --> 00:07:44,130
好的,我们去吃晚饭
Yes,let's go get dinner.

194
00:07:45,032 --> 00:07:47,612
不如就定在这周末的野营?
How about this weekend on the camping trip?

195
00:07:47,746 --> 00:07:49,223
我烤出一根真诚的香肠
I roast a mean weenie.

196
00:07:51,448 --> 00:07:53,088
你不是说真的吧
Oh,you're kidding me.

197
00:07:53,251 --> 00:07:54,824
不要,你别去
No way. Don't go on this thing.

198
00:07:55,015 --> 00:07:55,773
Ted,我肯定要去
Ted,I have to go.

199
00:07:55,974 --> 00:07:57,547
是公司的露营活动
It's a company camping trip.

200
00:07:57,681 --> 00:07:59,974
是吗? 因为这听起来像一次约会
Really? Because it also kinda sounds like a date.

201
00:08:00,108 --> 00:08:02,688
和Sandy...以及他的小香肠
With Sandy... and his weenie.

202
00:08:02,851 --> 00:08:04,817
你能说这不是?
I mean is this not a date?

203
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:06,457
我...我不知道
I don't...I don't know.

204
00:08:06,658 --> 00:08:08,758
怎么了? 难道你喜欢那个家伙?
So,what? You actually like this guy now?

205
00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:10,696
我不知道
I don't know.

206
00:08:10,859 --> 00:08:11,904
你要和他勾搭在一起?
Are you gonna hook up with him?

207
00:08:12,048 --> 00:08:12,921
我不知道
I don't know.

208
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,640
不,你知道
Yes,you do.

209
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:14,724
不,Ted,我不知道
No,Ted,I don't.

210
00:08:14,867 --> 00:08:16,642
你知道吗? 我无所谓
And you know what? That's okay.

211
00:08:16,738 --> 00:08:19,490
我不像你一样,把将来的每一分都计划好
I don't plan out every second of my life like you do.

212
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,226
- 我没有计划... 
- 哦,是吗?
- I don't plan out every...
- oh,really?

213
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,933
这算什么?
What is all of this?

214
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:24,573
你就不能简单地说
I mean,why can't you just say,

215
00:08:24,688 --> 00:08:26,558
"嗨,Robin,一起去吃寿司?"
"hey,Robin,let's go get some sushi?"

216
00:08:26,664 --> 00:08:29,963
不,你非要弄个乐队还有巴黎
No,it has to be a-a string quartet and-and Paris

217
00:08:30,097 --> 00:08:33,674
鲜花巧克力,还有厮守终生
and flowers and chocolates and let's spend the rest of our lives together.

218
00:08:33,808 --> 00:08:36,782
你不觉得我们的关系应该超过寿司了吗?
Don't you think we're a little bit past sushi at this point?

219
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,697
天啊,你畏惧真实的生活
God,you are so terrified of anything real.

220
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,663
你就像漂浮在空气中
It's like you're floating out in space.

221
00:08:41,807 --> 00:08:43,667
脚踏实地吧,Robin
Touch the ground,Robin.

222
00:08:43,802 --> 00:08:45,183
回到真实中来,犯个错误
Live in the world, make a mistake.

223
00:08:45,346 --> 00:08:46,420
犯这个错
Make this mistake.

224
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:48,232
我要好好想想
I need to think about this.

225
00:08:48,367 --> 00:08:49,316
可以
Fine.

226
00:08:49,844 --> 00:08:51,100
不,对不起,我...
No,I'm sorry,I...

227
00:08:52,117 --> 00:08:53,459
我不能再这样下去
I can't do this anymore.

228
00:08:53,565 --> 00:08:55,061
我需要答案
I need an answer.

229
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:58,571
如果你要我马上就说同意,我...
If you want me to say yes right now,I...

230
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,048
我不能
I can't do that.

231
00:09:00,508 --> 00:09:01,697
好吧,如果不说"是"
Well,if it's not yes,

232
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,788
那就是"否"
then it's a no.

233
00:09:06,023 --> 00:09:08,938
也许我们真的没有缘分
Then I guess it's not meant to be.

234
00:09:11,854 --> 00:09:13,158
你努力了,兄弟
Nice,try,buddy.

235
00:09:13,321 --> 00:09:15,105
场面很劲爆
Good hustle out there.

236
00:09:15,786 --> 00:09:16,937
想想好的一面
Look at the bright side.

237
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:18,183
至少你可以了结了
At least you got some closure.

238
00:09:18,346 --> 00:09:20,840
她作出了选择,你可以继续前行了
She's made her choice and you can finally move on.

239
00:09:22,058 --> 00:09:23,372
去他妈,这事没完
Screw that. This ain't over.

240
00:09:24,954 --> 00:09:27,371
Ted,你坐在这里宣布的...
Ted,you sat here in this very booth and you said...

241
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,337
不管我说过什么
I don't care what I said.

242
00:09:29,471 --> 00:09:30,593
我一定要成功
This is gonna happen.

243
00:09:30,785 --> 00:09:32,166
她不能说没有缘分
She can't say it's not meant to be.

244
00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:33,020
我们注定要在一起
It is meant to be,

245
00:09:33,154 --> 00:09:34,036
知道为什么?
and you know why?

246
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,676
因为我决定要在一起
Cause I mean it to be.

247
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:40,328
取消暂停?
Unpause?

248
00:09:40,462 --> 00:09:41,181
取消暂停
Unpause.

249
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:42,620
让我们暂停
Let's pause.

250
00:09:42,946 --> 00:09:46,091
是这样的,Marshall和Lily吵架的时候 有一条规矩
See,Marshall and Lily had a rule that at any point during a fight

251
00:09:46,197 --> 00:09:47,770
他们可以暂停休息一下
they could pause and take a break.

252
00:09:47,904 --> 00:09:49,899
他们的战争经常持续数天
Their fights often lasted for days.

253
00:09:50,033 --> 00:09:51,040
油画奖学金?
A painting fellowship?

254
00:09:51,184 --> 00:09:52,028
我原本就不会去的
I was never going to take it.

255
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,502
- 在加州? 
- 我原本就不会去的
- In California?
- I was never gonna take it.

256
00:09:54,742 --> 00:09:57,657
Ted,她要去参加露营了
Ted,she is going on that camping trip.

257
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,432
有本事你就阻挡天意
Dude,barring some act of god,

258
00:09:59,527 --> 00:10:02,443
否则Robin将和Sandy共度周末
Robin's gonna be with Sandy this weekend.

259
00:10:03,651 --> 00:10:04,994
好吧
Fine.

260
00:10:05,224 --> 00:10:07,718
如果必须要对抗天意
If an act of god is what it takes,

261
00:10:07,881 --> 00:10:09,684
那就对抗天意吧
then an act of god it is.

262
00:10:10,336 --> 00:10:12,340
你说什么呢?
What are you talking about?

263
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,745
我要让它下雨
I'm gonna make it rain.

264
00:10:19,268 --> 00:10:21,339
我不会坐视Robin和那个家伙去出游
i can't let Robin go camping with this guy.

265
00:10:21,502 --> 00:10:22,807
怎样才能阻止这一切?
So how do I keep that from happening?

266
00:10:22,941 --> 00:10:25,204
简单――下雨即可!
Simple-- I make it rain!

267
00:10:25,338 --> 00:10:27,036
Ted,你想让我再扇你一下吗?
Ted,do you want me to slap you again?

268
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,973
上次扇的还蛮过瘾的
Cause I kind of enjoyed it the first time.

269
00:10:29,203 --> 00:10:30,450
听着,也许我疯了...
Look,I-I might be crazy right now...

270
00:10:30,584 --> 00:10:32,483
不对,你知道吗? 我绝对是疯了
no,you know what? I am definitely crazy right now,

271
00:10:32,646 --> 00:10:33,596
但是我有计划
but I have a plan.

272
00:10:33,893 --> 00:10:35,370
你以前约过的那个女孩,Penelope,
That girl you used to go out with,Penelope,

273
00:10:35,504 --> 00:10:37,739
她是不是土著文化方面的博士?
wasn't she getting her PHD in native american culture?

274
00:10:37,864 --> 00:10:38,554
是
Yeah.

275
00:10:38,688 --> 00:10:39,551
你和她还有联系吗?
Are you still in touch with her?

276
00:10:39,686 --> 00:10:41,796
当然,虽然我们不在一起做爱
Sure. I mean,even though we stopped having sex,

277
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:44,116
我们还是经常相聚,每月一次,聊天叙旧
we still get together,like,once a month to chat and catch up,

278
00:10:44,222 --> 00:10:45,708
当然我们没有联系了!
and of course I'm not in touch with her!

279
00:10:45,872 --> 00:10:47,742
那好,你要重新和她取得联系
Well,you're gonna need to get in touch with her.

280
00:10:47,876 --> 00:10:50,101
我要她教我怎么跳祈雨舞
She's gonna teach me how to do a rain dance.

281
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:54,321
- 你是说"祈雨舞"? 
- 是的
- Did you just say a "rain dance"?
- Yes.

282
00:10:54,973 --> 00:10:56,891
- 祈雨舞 
- 是的
- A rain dance.
- Yes.

283
00:10:57,179 --> 00:10:59,538
祈求下雨的舞蹈
A dance to make it rain.

284
00:10:59,682 --> 00:11:00,727
是的
Yes.

285
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:08,630
要找到Penelope!
We're finding Penelope!

286
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:09,445
我才不去!
No,we are not!

287
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:10,365
要去!
Yes,we are!

288
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,494
Ted,不要逼我做"理性"的代言人
Ted,you're forcing me to be the voice of reason

289
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:14,365
我不适合代言理性!
and it's not a good look for me!

290
00:11:15,544 --> 00:11:17,280
我为什么要帮你?
Why the hell should I help you?

291
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,611
别这样,尽管我们两个没有结果
Come on,I know it didn't work out between us,

292
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:22,094
但是我们...还是有过一段情
but we did...have a relationship.

293
00:11:22,584 --> 00:11:24,291
我们在你的车里做过两次
We had sex twice in your car,

294
00:11:24,425 --> 00:11:25,768
然后你甩了我
and then you dumped me.

295
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,801
这也叫一段情?
How is that a relationship?

296
00:11:28,156 --> 00:11:29,374
做了两次!
Twice!

297
00:11:29,863 --> 00:11:31,234
Barney,我不可能...
Barney,there is no way...

298
00:11:31,378 --> 00:11:32,452
嘘!
shh!

299
00:11:32,653 --> 00:11:33,939
说真的,好吗
seriously,come on.

300
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:38,456
Penelope,我需要这个周末下雨
Penelope,I really need to make it rain this weekend.

301
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,722
为什么?
Why?

302
00:11:40,048 --> 00:11:40,872
有一个女孩子...
There's this girl...

303
00:11:41,592 --> 00:11:43,107
"有一个女孩子"
"There's this girl."

304
00:11:43,308 --> 00:11:47,068
你懂吗,传统的祈雨是对自然的神圣的崇拜
You know,the traditional rain dance is a sacred prayer to nature.

305
00:11:47,365 --> 00:11:51,786
伟大的神明不会帮某些白人泡妞
I don't think the great spirit looks too kindly on white dudes who co-opt it to get laid.

306
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,503
Penelope,这个女孩子是我爱着的
Penelope,this is the girl I love.

307
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:54,616
如果这个周末不下雨
If it doesn't rain this weekend,

308
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,301
她就要和错误的对象在一起,求你
she's gonna end up with the wrong guy. Please.

309
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:00,936
这个错误的对象
This wrong guy,

310
00:12:01,453 --> 00:12:03,621
- 是不是超级坏蛋? 
- 绝对的
- is he a huge jackass?
- Absolutely.

311
00:12:03,755 --> 00:12:04,599
类似Barney这样的?
Kind of like Barney?

312
00:12:04,705 --> 00:12:05,146
类似
Kind of.

313
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:05,798
嗨
Hey.

314
00:12:05,903 --> 00:12:06,978
你对我妈放电!
You hit on my mom!

315
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,665
我们又不排斥他人!
We weren't exclusive!

316
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:11,610
我帮你
I'm in.

317
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:14,295
我们一行三人来到我家屋顶
And so the three of us headed up to the roof of my building.

318
00:12:14,439 --> 00:12:15,379
好的
Okay.

319
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:17,930
双腿弯曲,稍微弯下腰
Crouch down and bend over a little bit.

320
00:12:18,074 --> 00:12:20,855
灌了5杯龙舌兰酒才让你摆出这个体位
Wow,it took five shots of tequila to get you in that position.

321
00:12:21,248 --> 00:12:23,348
信不信把你从房顶扔下去
I will throw you off this roof.

322
00:12:23,703 --> 00:12:25,928
有其母必有其女
There's so much of your mom in you.

323
00:12:28,911 --> 00:12:30,848
然后她就吐个不停
And she's been throwing up ever since.

324
00:12:30,973 --> 00:12:33,735
她怎么吃到这么多巧克力的?
So how'd she manage to eat so much chocolate?

325
00:12:33,907 --> 00:12:35,346
还记得那个人,Ted?
Remember that guy,Ted,

326
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,852
我跟你提过的?
that I was telling you about?

327
00:12:36,986 --> 00:12:38,501
我回家就发现他
Well,I came home and I found him

328
00:12:38,645 --> 00:12:40,659
和一只乐队等在我公寓
waiting in my apartment with a string quartet

329
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:42,232
还有玫瑰和巧克力...
and roses and chocolates...

330
00:12:42,366 --> 00:12:44,131
哦,太甜蜜了
oh,that's so sweet.

331
00:12:44,956 --> 00:12:46,231
理论上说是甜蜜的
Okay,yes,it's sweet in theory,

332
00:12:46,394 --> 00:12:48,590
是不是还有点疯狂?
but isn't it also kind of crazy?

333
00:12:48,753 --> 00:12:51,506
起居室里有一支乐队--
I mean,a string quartet in my living room--

334
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,753
谁会做这种事?
who does that?

335
00:12:52,925 --> 00:12:54,076
没人会
Nobody does that.

336
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,102
正是
Exactly.

337
00:12:55,236 --> 00:12:58,181
不,亲爱的,没人这么做
No,honey--nobody does that.

338
00:12:59,456 --> 00:13:02,180
我想我是一个无可救药的浪漫主义者
But I guess I'm just a hopeless romantic.

339
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:04,012
现在要为你的狗看病了
I'm gonna put my hand up your dog now.

340
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:09,162
这么说你要禁止我去?
So you're saying you would forbid me from going?

341
00:13:09,296 --> 00:13:10,840
禁止? 谁说禁止了?
Forbid? Who said forbid?

342
00:13:10,974 --> 00:13:14,110
我只是提醒你,几个月后有一场婚礼
I was just reminding you that there's this wedding coming up in a couple of months,

343
00:13:14,283 --> 00:13:15,817
我想你等到那一天
and I was kind of hoping you'd save the day.

344
00:13:15,952 --> 00:13:18,368
我会穿着帅气的礼服
Look for me-- I'll be the guy in the awesome suit.

345
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:19,721
好吗,Lily
Come on,Lily.

346
00:13:19,884 --> 00:13:20,843
那不是你一直梦想的吗
It's what you've always wanted.

347
00:13:20,987 --> 00:13:23,077
是啊,可是我的梦想还有很多
Yeah,but there's a lot of things I've always wanted,

348
00:13:23,183 --> 00:13:25,302
都没有去做过
and I haven't done any of them.

349
00:13:26,252 --> 00:13:26,942
对不起
I'm sorry.

350
00:13:27,077 --> 00:13:30,711
我想在稳定下来之前都尝试一遍
I just need to do this before settling down forever.

351
00:13:30,884 --> 00:13:33,166
现在我们从"我原本就不会去"
So now we've gone from "I was never gonna do it"

352
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:34,519
转到"我需要去做"?
to "I need to do this"?

353
00:13:34,653 --> 00:13:36,418
我中途离开过吗,什么时候改的?
Did I leave the room at some point? When did that happen?

354
00:13:36,542 --> 00:13:38,278
也许是你说我不可以的时候改的
Oh,maybe when you said you wouldn't let me do it.

355
00:13:38,412 --> 00:13:39,956
我从来没说过!
I never said that!

356
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,788
如果你现在有这样的犹豫
You know,if you're having these kind of doubts now,

357
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:43,035
3个月后会有什么变化?
what's gonna change in three months?

358
00:13:43,169 --> 00:13:44,416
我们干脆不要结婚算了
Maybe we just shouldn't get married at all.

359
00:13:44,512 --> 00:13:45,528
那就不结
Maybe not.

360
00:13:48,252 --> 00:13:49,298
- 暂停 
- 暂停
- Pause.
- Pause.

361
00:13:50,314 --> 00:13:51,762
你怎么样? 饿吗?
So,are you just,like,starving?

362
00:13:51,858 --> 00:13:53,671
饿死了,去Red Lobster? (一家颇大型的连锁餐厅)
Totally. Red Lobster?

363
00:13:54,783 --> 00:13:56,644
哦,龙虾龙虾龙虾
Oh,lobster,lobster,lobster

364
00:13:56,788 --> 00:13:58,121
你真好味道!
you are delicious!

365
00:13:58,265 --> 00:13:59,904
老天,我爱死奶油酱了!
Oh,god,I love butter sauce!

366
00:14:00,096 --> 00:14:01,554
完美无缺
There's nothing bad about it.

367
00:14:01,688 --> 00:14:03,913
我肯定你也找不出一点奶油酱的坏处
Say something bad about butter sauce,I dare you.

368
00:14:04,038 --> 00:14:05,122
我找不出
I wouldn't dare.

369
00:14:06,177 --> 00:14:07,289
Marshall,不
Marshall,no.

370
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:08,967
我们正在暂停期
We're on pause.

371
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:11,231
暂停的大地上没有哭泣!
There's no crying in pauseland!

372
00:14:11,365 --> 00:14:12,967
暂停的地方是个仙境
Pauseland is a magical place,

373
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:16,477
有虾片堆成的山和奶油酱的河!
with-with...popcorn shrimp mountains and butter sauce rivers!

374
00:14:19,229 --> 00:14:20,447
快乐快乐快乐快乐!
Happy,happy,happy,happy

375
00:14:20,581 --> 00:14:21,761
快乐生日快乐!
happy happy birthday,

376
00:14:21,857 --> 00:14:22,883
快乐快乐快乐快乐!
happy,happy,happy,happy

377
00:14:23,017 --> 00:14:23,928
快乐生日快乐!
happy,happy birthday,

378
00:14:31,883 --> 00:14:33,101
Ted,这很搞笑
Ted,this is funny.

379
00:14:34,146 --> 00:14:34,942
还是搞笑
Still funny.

380
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:39,172
还是搞...现在是可悲了
Still fu...and now it's sad.

381
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,193
嗨,Penelope,你肯定这样跳是对的?
Hey,Penelope,you sure I'm doing this right?

382
00:14:42,327 --> 00:14:43,142
应该是的
I think so.

383
00:14:43,276 --> 00:14:44,091
啊
Uh-huh.

384
00:14:44,226 --> 00:14:46,815
这个...真正的祈雨舞是这样的吗?
Does it,uh,look anything like a real rain dance?

385
00:14:46,988 --> 00:14:48,522
应该是
I think so.

386
00:14:49,107 --> 00:14:50,220
嗨,Penelope
Hey,Penelope,

387
00:14:50,392 --> 00:14:53,596
你有没有亲眼见过祈雨舞?
have you,uh,have you ever actually seen a rain dance performed?

388
00:14:54,545 --> 00:14:55,437
没
No.

389
00:14:57,566 --> 00:14:58,285
没?
No?

390
00:14:58,448 --> 00:14:59,925
我花了很大力气看资料
I've read extensively on the subject:

391
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,786
第一手资料,理论批评
Firsthand accounts,theoretical criticism,

392
00:15:01,891 --> 00:15:02,706
还有人类学...
the anthropological...

393
00:15:02,812 --> 00:15:05,727
你见过祈雨舞吗?
have you ever seen a rain dance?

394
00:15:06,054 --> 00:15:08,115
我看过电影片段
I've seen a film strip.

395
00:15:08,231 --> 00:15:09,669
太好了,我得走了
Terrific. Uh, look,I should run.

396
00:15:09,803 --> 00:15:13,246
我要请一个看过几集ER的人给我做大脑手术
I'm getting brain surgery from some guy who's seen a couple episodes of E.R.

397
00:15:13,735 --> 00:15:14,915
简直太离谱了
I can't believe this.

398
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:17,763
我们这一个小时完全是在做蠢事
We've been up here for the past hour making complete asses of ourselves.

399
00:15:17,898 --> 00:15:20,190
你说"我们"是什么意思， 白人?
What do you mean "we," white man?

400
00:15:23,403 --> 00:15:25,263
我们怎么会到这个地步的?
How did we get here?

401
00:15:26,021 --> 00:15:28,092
几天前，我生命中最大的麻烦还是
Couple of days ago,the biggest problem in my life was,

402
00:15:28,207 --> 00:15:31,180
Ted有没有吃掉冰箱里最后一份布丁
did Ted eat the last pudding snack pack in the fridge.

403
00:15:31,506 --> 00:15:33,118
我想还有一块
I think there's still one left.

404
00:15:33,568 --> 00:15:34,556
我的
Dibs.

405
00:15:38,325 --> 00:15:39,275
取消暂停?
Unpause?

406
00:15:39,409 --> 00:15:40,358
取消暂停
Unpause.

407
00:15:41,538 --> 00:15:42,516
瞧...
Look...

408
00:15:42,746 --> 00:15:44,549
我知道这很遭
I know this sucks.

409
00:15:44,751 --> 00:15:47,177
这只是我在经历的一些事情
It's just something I'm going through.

410
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,469
我不是叫你去理解
I'm not asking you to understand it.

411
00:15:49,719 --> 00:15:51,493
我也不是想你觉得高兴
I'm not asking you to be happy about it.

412
00:15:51,656 --> 00:15:54,993
我... 我只是要你的支持
I... I'm just asking you to support it.

413
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:58,839
我想,Lily,好吗?
I want to,Lily,okay?

414
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,997
我真的想
I really do.

415
00:16:01,457 --> 00:16:03,097
但我不能
But I just can't.

416
00:16:03,366 --> 00:16:05,006
- 为什么不能? 
- 因为你吓死我了
- Why not?
- Because you're scaring the hell out of me,

417
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,742
所以不能
that's why not.

418
00:16:07,106 --> 00:16:08,669
如果你决定做个画家呢
What if you decide to go be a painter

419
00:16:08,813 --> 00:16:10,645
然后你会意识到我不适合你的生活
and then you realize I don't fit in to your life anymore,

420
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:12,831
到时候三个月就变成了永远?
and three months becomes forever?

421
00:16:13,033 --> 00:16:15,200
你能保证这样的事不会发生吗?
Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?

422
00:16:16,015 --> 00:16:15,776
Marshall...
Marshall...

423
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,682
你不能保证，我们现在就该分手
cause if you can't promise me that,we should just break up right now.

424
00:16:18,797 --> 00:16:19,813
我不要等三个月
I'm not gonna wait around for three months

425
00:16:19,948 --> 00:16:21,683
我的心会被狠狠的撕碎的
just to have my heart ripped out.

426
00:16:24,474 --> 00:16:26,114
Marshall,我爱你
Marshall,I love you.

427
00:16:27,265 --> 00:16:29,615
你能保证这样的事不会发生吗?
Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?

428
00:16:29,816 --> 00:16:30,276
暂停
Pause.

429
00:16:30,411 --> 00:16:31,849
不,Lily,我们不能再暂停了
No,Lily,we cannot pause this anymore.

430
00:16:31,955 --> 00:16:33,585
你能保证这样的事不会发生吗?!
Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?!

431
00:16:33,691 --> 00:16:33,921
暂停!
Pause!

432
00:16:34,065 --> 00:16:36,251
为什么要我暂停?!
Why do you want me to pause?!

433
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:41,027
暂停功能使用的很好,宝贝
That's just a great use of the pause function,baby.

434
00:16:41,142 --> 00:16:42,188
谢谢
Thank you.

435
00:16:48,421 --> 00:16:49,726
嘿,Ted
hey,Ted.

436
00:16:50,349 --> 00:16:51,759
你在干吗?
What you doing?

437
00:16:51,922 --> 00:16:52,939
祈雨
A rain dance.

438
00:16:53,456 --> 00:16:54,837
伙计，你不是在祈雨
Dude,that's not a rain dance,

439
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:58,050
就像一只蜜蜂飞进胖男孩的裤子里一样
that's a fat kid with a bee in his pants.

440
00:16:58,568 --> 00:17:01,023
瞧，我很怀疑一个舞蹈术的坚持者的信念
Look,I highly doubt the great spirit is a stickler for choreography.

441
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:02,730
心诚则灵
It's the thought that counts.

442
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:05,348
她还有半小时就要出发了
She's leaving in half an hour.

443
00:17:07,947 --> 00:17:10,988
你正在花样年华，不要把时间浪费在一个女孩身上
These are your awesome years. You're wasting them on this girl.

444
00:17:11,122 --> 00:17:12,273
这样是办不到的!
This isn't gonna work!

445
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:13,913
对，我知道
Yeah. I know that.

446
00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:15,255
那你干吗还这么做?
Well,then why are you doing this?

447
00:17:15,351 --> 00:17:16,598
因为我爱她
Because I love her.

448
00:17:16,924 --> 00:17:18,200
我爱她!
I love her!

449
00:17:18,343 --> 00:17:19,657
我们第一次约会我就告诉她了
I told her that the first night we went out,

450
00:17:19,763 --> 00:17:22,678
而8个月过去了，什么都没变
and here it is,eight months later,and nothing's changed.

451
00:17:22,813 --> 00:17:25,766
所以，我知道这没有用
So yes,I know this isn't gonna work.

452
00:17:25,891 --> 00:17:27,521
但这必须管用!
But it has to work!

453
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:29,612
你听见我的话吗,宇宙?
You hear me,universe?

454
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:32,432
我是Ted Mosby!
This is Ted Mosby talking!

455
00:17:32,662 --> 00:17:34,772
给我点雨吧!
Give me some rain!

456
00:17:35,482 --> 00:17:36,690
拜托!
Come on!

457
00:17:37,908 --> 00:17:39,375
拜托!
Come on!

458
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:42,387
拜托...!
Come on...!

459
00:17:45,676 --> 00:17:47,738
哦,拜托!
oh,come on!

460
00:18:00,214 --> 00:18:03,129
前锋又到达本地区
pushing the front back into the tri-state area

461
00:18:03,225 --> 00:18:07,062
为曼哈顿带来了10年来最遭的一场风暴
and giving Manhattan one of its worst storms in over a decade.

462
00:18:07,196 --> 00:18:09,200
怎么样?他做到了
How about that? He did it.

463
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:30,683
Robin!
Robin!

464
00:18:30,817 --> 00:18:32,284
嘿,Robin!
Hey,Robin!

465
00:18:38,672 --> 00:18:40,120
哦,谢天谢地你在家!
Oh,thank god you're here!

466
00:18:40,254 --> 00:18:42,345
下雨我的野营取消了
My camping trip got rained out.

467
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,917
我知道,对不起
I know. I'm sorry.

468
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:45,529
是你的错?
So your fault?

469
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,833
对
Yeah,it is.

470
00:18:46,977 --> 00:18:48,061
下来
Come down here.

471
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:49,998
雨好大，你上来
It's pouring. You come up.

472
00:18:50,103 --> 00:18:51,638
不，你得下来
No,you have to come down here.

473
00:18:52,856 --> 00:18:53,709
为什么?
Why?

474
00:18:53,834 --> 00:18:57,699
为什么?因为我祈来了雨 这是我今天所做的!
Why? Because I made it rain,that's what I did today!

475
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,876
这就够了,我已经完成了我的部分
And that's enough. I-I've done my part.

476
00:18:59,981 --> 00:19:01,554
现在,下来!
Now,get down here!

477
00:19:02,168 --> 00:19:04,892
我没换衣服,Ted 不,上来
I'm not dressed,Ted. No. Come up.

478
00:19:05,026 --> 00:19:07,097
我不上去,Robin,不
I'm not coming up there,Robin,I'm not.

479
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,485
你得下来这里!
You have to come down here!

480
00:19:27,765 --> 00:19:28,427
我正要...
I was gonna...

481
00:19:28,532 --> 00:19:29,549
我知道
I know.

482
00:19:47,626 --> 00:19:50,149
Robin和我最后在一起了
And that's how Robin and I ended up together.

483
00:19:50,283 --> 00:19:52,777
原来我要做的就是让天下雨
Turns out,all I had to do was make it rain.

484
00:19:53,342 --> 00:19:56,229
我早上回家时 这个城市看起来一样
as I rode home this morning,the city looks the same

485
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:59,145
人们看起来一样 一切都一样
the people looks the same it all looks the same

486
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,554
但是并非如此
but it wasn't

487
00:20:00,698 --> 00:20:04,103
一夜间,一切都改变了
in just one night,everything is changed

488
00:20:32,797 --> 00:20:34,830
