当你们的Marshall叔叔十岁时
When your Uncle Marshall was ten years old,

3
00:00:15,155 --> 00:00:17,746
他读了本书叫《在大猩猩中生活》
he read a book called Life Among the Gorillas.

4
00:00:17,747 --> 00:00:22,500
Aurelia Birnholz-Vazquez一个人类学博士所写
It was written by an anthropologist named Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-Vazquez,

5
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:27,531
讲的是她和喀麦隆的西部低地猩猩一起生活的经历
and it told the story of the year she spent living among the Western Lowland Gorillas of Cameroon.

6
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:32,218
Birnholz-Vazquez博士来地方大学办讲座
When Dr. Birnholz-Vazquez came to the local community college to give a lecture,

7
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:36,207
最年轻的听众Marshall举起了手提问
Marshall, the youngest member of the audience, raised his hand with a question.

8
00:00:36,769 --> 00:00:39,745
你对未来的人类学家有什么建议?
What advice do you have for a budding anthropologist?

9
00:00:39,746 --> 00:00:41,521
你想成为人类学家吗?
So you want to be an anthropologist?

10
00:00:41,522 --> 00:00:45,031
对 我长大后要和你一样跟大猩猩一起生活
Yep. When I grow up, I want to go live with the gorillas, just like you did.

11
00:00:45,032 --> 00:00:47,754
她接下来说的话改变了他的一生
What she said next changed his life.

12
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,773
噢, 不错, 但恐怕你不行了
Oh, that's wonderful, but I'm afraid you can't.

13
00:00:50,766 --> 00:00:52,713
等你长大那时候猩猩已经死光了
They'll all be dead by then.

14
00:00:55,396 --> 00:00:58,434
...如果不强制执行经济制裁和贸易管制
...and if economic sanctions and trade restrictions aren't enforced,

15
00:00:58,435 --> 00:01:02,939
对雨林的破坏将会持续，超过百万的物种将会灭绝
the destruction of the rainforests will continue and over a million species will be wiped out.

16
00:01:03,234 --> 00:01:04,858
所以你不要咖啡?
So you don't want coffee?

17
00:01:04,966 --> 00:01:07,644
我在说咖啡工业将导致无法挽回的...
I'm saying that the coffee industry is causing irreversible...

18
00:01:07,645 --> 00:01:09,674
- 好吧 我把它倒了
- 好吧, 就一杯
- All right. I'm pouring it out.
- Okay, one cup.

19
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:12,954
小朋友需要被警告，工作第一天得多加小心
The kid needs to be alert. First day on the job and everything.

20
00:01:12,955 --> 00:01:15,155
我还是不敢相信你要去公司工作
I still can't believe you're going all corporate on us.

21
00:01:15,156 --> 00:01:17,562
"男孩"已经成为"男人"了
"The kid" has become "the man."

22
00:01:17,563 --> 00:01:19,915
好了, 这只是实习挣点钱
Okay, it's just an internship to make a little money.

23
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:22,476
毕业后, 我会去自然资源保护委员会工作
After law school, I'm going to work for the NRDC.

24
00:01:22,477 --> 00:01:24,193
他们会阻止全球气候变暖
They're gonna stop global warming.

25
00:01:24,194 --> 00:01:26,630
嗯... 我是说... 他们会尽全力
Well... I mean... they did their best.

26
00:01:27,594 --> 00:01:29,208
你的外带午餐
Here's your sack lunch.

27
00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:33,032
好了, 我爱你因为，第一, 你给我准备外带午餐
Okay, I love you because, one, you made me a sack lunch

28
00:01:33,033 --> 00:01:35,808
第二, 你每次说"外带"时都会笑
and two, you laugh every time you say the word "sack".

29
00:01:35,991 --> 00:01:38,443
- 我爱你, 棉花糖
- 我爱你
- I love you, Marshmallow.
- I love you.

30
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:41,015
我也爱你, 棉花糖
I love you too, Marshmallow.

31
00:01:42,722 --> 00:01:43,789
啊哦
Uh-oh.

32
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,977
Ted?
Ted?

33
00:01:45,132 --> 00:01:47,813
噢, 别 别, 她不是吧
Oh, no. No, she didn't.

34
00:01:47,813 --> 00:01:49,781
是的 就是她
Yeah. Yeah, she did.

35
00:01:49,826 --> 00:01:51,742
又一个关怀包裹?
Another care package?

36
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:53,472
又一个关怀包裹
Another care package.

37
00:01:53,473 --> 00:01:57,126
我和Victoria异地恋持续了近一个月
I'd been in a long-distance relationship with Victoria for nearly a month.

38
00:01:57,127 --> 00:02:00,390
异地恋真糟糕
Long-distance relationships are a bad idea.

39
00:02:01,616 --> 00:02:02,867
到现在这是第几个了?
How many is that so far?

40
00:02:02,868 --> 00:02:03,758
三
Three.

41
00:02:03,758 --> 00:02:05,584
那你给她送了几个包裹?
And how many have you sent her?

42
00:02:05,934 --> 00:02:07,737
电邮里还是脑子里?
In the mail or in my mind?

43
00:02:07,738 --> 00:02:10,266
零，她却寄来了三个.
Zero. She's up three-zip.

44
00:02:10,267 --> 00:02:12,092
噢! 纸托蛋糕!
Oh! Cupcakes!

45
00:02:12,093 --> 00:02:14,345
真好 我打赌它们很可口
Great. I bet they're delicious, too.

46
00:02:15,782 --> 00:02:17,970
对了, 它们很可口
Yep, they're delicious.

47
00:02:18,117 --> 00:02:19,258
真该死!
Damn it!

48
00:02:21,169 --> 00:02:23,460
我不配吃这些可口的纸托蛋糕
I don't deserve these delicious cupcakes.

49
00:02:25,043 --> 00:02:27,120
天那, 我讨厌我自己
God, I hate myself right now.

50
00:02:27,927 --> 00:02:30,241
天那, 简直和我15岁时一样
God, that is so me at 15.

51
00:02:32,538 --> 00:02:36,087
Marshall要去一个叫Altrucel的公司工作
Marshall was going to work for a big corporation called Altrucel.

52
00:02:36,088 --> 00:02:40,342
Altrucel以生产网球面上的黄绒毛著名
Altrucel was most well-known for making the yellow fuzzy stuff on the surface of tennis balls.

53
00:02:40,343 --> 00:02:43,580
我是说, 这是一个大公司
所以他们也有其他的生意...
I mean, this was a huge company, so they did other things...

54
00:02:45,714 --> 00:02:49,064
但他们希望公众把注意力集中在那些黄绒毛上
But mostly they wanted the public to focus on the yellow fuzzy stuff.

55
00:02:49,064 --> 00:02:52,168
Marshall在他们的法律部找到了实习机会
Anyway, Marshall managed to score an internship in their legal department

56
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:54,060
因为他认识那里工作的某人
because he knew someone who worked there.

57
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:56,798
这里是Barney
Go for Barney.

58
00:02:56,799 --> 00:02:59,226
Stinson先生, 我是大厅保安Willis
Mr. Stinson, this is Willis from lobby security.

59
00:02:59,227 --> 00:03:03,083
抱歉打扰您, 但是我们接到报告,有个大脚野人进了大楼
Sorry to bother you, but we've had reports of a sasquatch loose in the building.

60
00:03:03,111 --> 00:03:04,173
大脚野人?
A sasquatch?

61
00:03:04,174 --> 00:03:06,709
对, 先生, 脚很大
That's right, sir, a Bigfoot.

62
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,871
我们不想吓到您, 但他在您的楼层
We don't want to alarm you, but he's been spotted on your floor.

63
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:16,691

Yeah, hell, yeah. I got 'em all: Teamwork, Courage, Awesomeness...

68
00:03:28,501 --> 00:03:29,517
有表示敬畏的吗?
There's one for awesomeness?

69
00:03:29,518 --> 00:03:31,073
是啊, 我让人做的
Yeah, I had it made.

70

你要和他们一起工作
You're gonna be working with them.

76
00:03:42,832 --> 00:03:44,179

77
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,971
领带不错 牛肉酱
Nice tie. Steak sauce.

78
00:03:45,972 --> 00:03:48,185
噢, 牛肉酱! 真的
Oh, steak sauce! For true, though.

79
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,643
哪里, 我没, 我没看见啊...
Where, I don't, I don't see...

80
00:03:49,644 --> 00:03:51,079
Marshall? 借一步说话
Marshall? Sidebar.

81
00:03:53,627 --> 00:03:58,518
你的领带很牛肉酱 就是说很棒?
懂了吗? 试着跟上进度
Your tie is steak sauce. It means A-1. A-1? Get it? Try to keep up.

82
00:03:58,685 --> 00:04:02,265
好了, Eriksen, 我们开始吧
凌晨两点 外面下着雨
Okay, Eriksen, let's get to work. 
It's 2:00 a.m. It's raining outside.

83
00:04:02,266 --> 00:04:04,074
叮咚! 什么? 门铃?
Ding dong! What? The doorbell?

84
00:04:04,075 --> 00:04:07,446
噢, 你好, Jessica Alba就穿了件雨衣
其他什么都没穿
Oh, hello, Jessica Alba in a trench coat and nothing else.

85
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:10,250
但等等 咚, 咚 后门有人敲门?
But wait-- knock, knock. Somebody's at the back door?

86
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:11,033
我家没后门
I don't have a back door.

87
00:04:11,034 --> 00:04:14,448
噢, 我的老天,Jessica Simpson? 太惊喜了
Oh, my gosh, Jessica Simpson? What a surprise.

88
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:18,649
两个Jessica, 你得选一个,你会怎样? 选!
Two Jessicas, you gotta pick one. What do you do? Go.

89
00:04:18,872 --> 00:04:20,932
好的, 呃... 我已经订婚了, 所以
Right. Well, uh... I'm engaged, so

90
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:23,827
未婚妻出城了 你会怎样?选
Fiancee's out of town. What do you do? Go.

91
00:04:24,213 --> 00:04:25,943
但我们还是订着婚, 就算她...
We're still engaged, even if she's...

92
00:04:25,944 --> 00:04:29,804
好吧, 未婚妻死了,被车撞的 你会怎样? 选
Okay, fiancee's dead. Hit by a bus. What do you do? Go.

93
00:04:33,988 --> 00:04:35,164
确定不想吃一个?
Sure you don't want one?

94
00:04:35,165 --> 00:04:36,773
你吃了多少了?
How  many of those have you eaten?

95
00:04:36,774 --> 00:04:40,002
十...四
不, 就四个
Four. Teen. No, just four.

96
00:04:40,003 --> 00:04:41,627
还把另两个的糖霜刮了吃了
And the icing from two more.

97
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:45,047
所以, 无论如何, 这就是问题了
So, anyway, here's the problem.

98
00:04:45,048 --> 00:04:47,019
嘿, 我是Ted,我猜你在睡觉
Hey, it's Ted. I guess you're asleep.

99
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,256
我收到关怀包裹了, 真是很棒
Anyway, I got the care package, and it's just great.

100
00:04:51,453 --> 00:04:53,101
这儿, 听着...
Here, listen...

101
00:04:53,853 --> 00:04:55,942
嗯 嗯!
Mmm. Mmm!

102
00:04:55,952 --> 00:05:00,965
我就站在那儿,嘴巴塞满美味的纸托蛋糕...
So I'm standing there, my mouth full of this delicious relationship-winning cupcake...

103
00:05:01,712 --> 00:05:04,100
然后... 我说了句蠢话
And... I said something dumb.

104
00:05:04,101 --> 00:05:07,135
噢, 还有, 呃... 别担心,你的包裹我送出去了
Oh, and, um... don't worry, yours is in the mail.

105
00:05:07,136 --> 00:05:08,689
我几天前送出去的
I sent it a couple days ago.

106
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,198
很不错的东西
And it's awesome.

107
00:05:10,214 --> 00:05:12,030
真的, 真的很不错
Really, really awesome.

108
00:05:12,054 --> 00:05:13,803
为什么我要说那些?
Why did I say that?

109
00:05:13,804 --> 00:05:16,478
我想是糖精让我撒谎
I think frosting makes me lie.

110
00:05:17,046 --> 00:05:18,492
噢, 小Teddy
Oh, Teddy boy.

111
00:05:18,493 --> 00:05:22,683
是啊 所以现在, 不管我送她什么
她都会发现我是在那之后送的
Yeah. So now, whatever I send her, 
she'll know I sent it after I talked to her.

112
00:05:22,684 --> 00:05:26,688
这就是问题 你想办法,我负责吃蛋糕
So that's the problem. You work on that. I'm gonna eat this cupcake.

113
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,175
好了, 你要做的是
All right, here's what you do:

114
00:05:29,176 --> 00:05:31,806
打包一些纽约的东西进关怀包裹
Put together a care package of stuff from New York

115
00:05:31,807 --> 00:05:34,718
一些面包圈, 帝国大厦钥匙圈...
some H&H bagels, an Empire State Building keychain...

116
00:05:34,718 --> 00:05:37,998
然后在最上面放一份纽约时报... 知道吗?
and then, top off the package with a New York Times... Ready?

117
00:05:37,999 --> 00:05:39,769
三天前的报纸
From three days ago.

118
00:05:40,266 --> 00:05:41,628
这太妙了
That's  brilliant.

119
00:05:41,837 --> 00:05:43,209
你真聪明
You're brilliant.

120
00:05:43,866 --> 00:05:45,480
你知道吗, 这太搞笑了, 不久前
You know, it's funny, not so long ago,

121
00:05:45,481 --> 00:05:48,533
我还去问Marshall和Lily如何打动你
I was coming to Marshall and Lily for advice on how to impress you.

122
00:05:48,673 --> 00:05:50,023
是很搞笑
That is funny.

123
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,999
这就是为什么很搞笑
And here's why it was funny.

124
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,184
几周前我知道了
Little did I realize, a few weeks earlier,

125
00:05:54,185 --> 00:05:56,922
Robin对Lily谈论我的内容
here's what Robin was saying to Lily about me.

126
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:59,252
好吧, 是, 我对他有感觉
Okay, fine, I have feelings for him.

127
00:05:59,988 --> 00:06:03,040
真讽刺, 我以前喜欢的女孩帮我出主意追现在我喜欢的女孩
Now it's ironic, the girl I used to like is helping me impress the girl I now like.

128
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,458
明显很讽刺, Ted
The irony is clear, Ted.

129
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,070
嘿! 第一天怎么样?
Hey! How was your first day?

130
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:12,641
我不想再提了
I don't wanna talk about it.

131
00:06:14,687 --> 00:06:17,296
和我一起工作的那帮家伙是群蠢人
The guys I work with are a bunch of jerks.

132
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,019
- 什么?
- 他们是笨蛋!
- What?
- They're jerks!

133
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,684
为什么他们很蠢?
What makes them jerks?

134
00:06:20,685 --> 00:06:22,682
算了, 我不想再提了
Forget it, I don't want to talk about it.

135
00:06:23,105 --> 00:06:24,778
嗯, 今天午餐时..
Well, like today at lunch..

136
00:06:26,612 --> 00:06:29,310
里面有什么, Ericksen?
妈咪给你打包的午餐?
What do you got there, Ericksen? 
Mommy pack your lunch?

137
00:06:29,736 --> 00:06:31,797
仅为告知, 我未婚妻做的
For your information, my fiancee did.

138
00:06:31,798 --> 00:06:35,267
噢... 她也帮你把土司皮给去了吧?
Oh... Does she cut the crusts off your sandwich, too?

139
00:06:35,267 --> 00:06:36,442
没
No.

140
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,354
那是什么?
What's that?

141
00:06:44,355 --> 00:06:45,371
没什么
Nothing.

142
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:46,477
拿来
Give it.

143
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:50,379
"亲爱的棉花糖 祝你好运，我爱你 百合花"
"Dear Marshmallow. Good luck today. I love you. Lilypad."

144
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,229
拿来
Give it.

145
00:06:51,222 --> 00:06:55,975
另外 我给你的吻会在你打开这张字条时飞出来 快接住"
P.S. If you've unfolded this note, your kiss already got out. Quick-- catch it."

146
00:06:55,968 --> 00:06:59,162
还给我 嘿, 拿来 给我... 还给我!
Give it back. Hey, give it. Give me... Give it!

147
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,853
噢, 这些坏家伙! 我们那么可爱
Oh, screw those guys! We're adorable.

148
00:07:01,852 --> 00:07:03,577
我知道 天那
I know. God.

149
00:07:03,578 --> 00:07:05,567
就象又回到当新生时
It's like freshman year all over again.

150
00:07:05,568 --> 00:07:08,963
只是这次, 我的舞蹈搞不定他们了
Only this time, my sweet dance moves aren't going to be enough to win them over.

151
00:07:08,964 --> 00:07:10,716
机器人舞也不行
Not even Old Reliable.

152
00:07:15,288 --> 00:07:18,788
甜心... 弄点外快确实不错
Sweetie... It would be cool to have some extra money,

153
00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:22,229
但, 但是, 如果你不开心, 就不值得了
but, but, if you're unhappy, it's not worth it.

154
00:07:22,705 --> 00:07:23,739
我辞职
I quit.

155
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,282
什么? 不行 我们一起会很好玩的
What? No. We're having so much fun.

156
00:07:26,283 --> 00:07:28,230
你, 我, 一起工作 太棒了
You, me, working together. It's great.

157
00:07:28,231 --> 00:07:31,633
我们根本没一起工作, Barney,我在法律部而你...
We're not even working together, Barney. I'm in the legal department and you're...

158
00:07:31,634 --> 00:07:33,456
说真的, 你到底是做什么的?
Seriously, what is it that you do?

159
00:07:33,776 --> 00:07:34,739
拜托
Please.

160
00:07:35,587 --> 00:07:39,224
抱歉, 兄弟, 公司的工作,这个... 不适合我
I'm sorry, dude, this corporate thing, it's just... it's not for me.

161
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,397
噢, 当然不是为了你自己
Oh, of course it's not for you.

162
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,362
这是为了Lily
It's for Lily.

163
00:07:44,453 --> 00:07:45,197
什么?
What?

164
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,575
Marshall, Lily很抢手
Marshall. Lily's a catch.

165
00:07:47,576 --> 00:07:50,904
你真的以为可以没福利就和一个这么好的女孩在一起?
But do you really think you're going to hang onto a girl that great without the package?

166
00:07:50,905 --> 00:07:51,965
福利?
The package?

167
00:07:51,966 --> 00:07:55,292
福利: 房子, 车, 把孩子送进好学校
The package. The house. The car. Sending your kids to a great school.

168
00:07:55,293 --> 00:07:56,585
偶尔渡个假
A vacation once in a while.

169
00:07:56,586 --> 00:07:58,563
Lily不在乎这些
Lily doesn't care about that stuff.

170
00:07:58,564 --> 00:08:02,209
嗯, 现在她不在乎, 但几年后呢?
Well, no-- now she doesn't, but how's she going to feel in a couple years,

171
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,199
当她在用幼儿园教师的薪水供养你
when she's supporting you on a kindergarten teacher's salary

172
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:11,768
你却在法庭上为那些濒临灭绝的...南美...飞海狸辩护时
while you're off in court defending some... endangered... South American... flying beaver.

173
00:08:15,285 --> 00:08:16,531
她会开心的
She'll be happy.

174
00:08:16,565 --> 00:08:17,641
好吧
Okay.

175
00:08:18,202 --> 00:08:23,282
但当你知道你可以让她更开心，不感到开心吗
But will you be happy knowing you could have made her a lot happier.

176
00:08:24,991 --> 00:08:30,641
四个都是裸体的 你得挑一个，你会怎样? 选
And all four are totally naked. You gotta choose one. What do you do? Go.

177
00:08:31,424 --> 00:08:33,112
我猜, 呃...
I guess, uh...

178
00:08:34,003 --> 00:08:35,188
Bea Arthur
Bea Arthur.

179
00:08:35,189 --> 00:08:38,228
啊! 错! Betty White
Ahh! Wrong! Betty White.

180
00:08:39,204 --> 00:08:40,720
把这里收拾干净, Eriksen
Clean this stuff up, Eriksen.

181
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:46,153
那她收到关怀包裹了吗?
So, did she get the awesome care package yet?

182
00:08:46,154 --> 00:08:47,484
嗯 昨天
Yep. Yesterday.

183
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,575
她喜欢吗?
Did she love it?

184
00:08:48,576 --> 00:08:50,422
噢, 她很喜欢
Oh, she loved it.

185
00:08:50,423 --> 00:08:51,939
那有什么问题?
So what's the problem?

186
00:08:52,253 --> 00:08:55,040
我昨天和她聊天了 我得申明
So I was talking to her last night. And, I should tell you,

187
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,816
我们每隔一天就讲差不多一个半小时电话
we've been talking on the phone every other night for, like, an hour and a half.

188
00:08:57,817 --> 00:09:00,147
渐渐的没有什么话题可说了
Eventually you just run out of stuff to say.

189
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,805
今天午餐吃了什么?
What did you have for lunch today?

190
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,201
噢 黑麦面包
Oh. Rye bread.

191
00:09:14,395 --> 00:09:15,615
耶
Yeah.

192
00:09:21,876 --> 00:09:23,711
噢, 小Teddy
Oh, Teddy boy.

193
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:27,825
我一般都会是个好男友的，但是这样见不了面, 真糟糕
I'm usually so good at being a boyfriend, but this never-seeing-each-other thing, it's a bitch.

194
00:09:27,826 --> 00:09:29,489
也许这样行不通
Maybe it just can't be done.

195
00:09:29,871 --> 00:09:31,709
我想我该做什么很明显了
I think it's clear what I have to do.

196
00:09:32,343 --> 00:09:34,015
很明显
It's pretty clear.

197
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:37,236
我要去德国给她一个惊喜
I have to go to Germany and surprise her.

198
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:40,131
完全和我想的一样
Totally what I was thinking.

199
00:09:40,132 --> 00:09:41,911
滚出我脑袋, 伙计!
Get out of my head, man!

200
00:09:45,662 --> 00:09:48,616
Barney, 我该怎么让那些白痴离我远点?
Barney, how do I get these idiots to leave me alone?

201
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,046
Marshall,  想想企鹅
Marshall,  consider the penguins.

202
00:09:52,448 --> 00:09:53,424
企鹅?
The penguins?

203
00:09:53,425 --> 00:09:54,545
在墙上
On the wall.

204
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:03,692
"团结 才能抵御寒冷"
"Conformity. It's the one who's different that gets left out in the cold."

205
00:10:03,693 --> 00:10:05,348
这是激励人的海报吗?
This is a motivational poster?

206
00:10:05,543 --> 00:10:07,626
看看你自己, Marshall你不开心
Look at yourself, Marshall. You're not happy.

207
00:10:07,627 --> 00:10:10,321
知道为什么吗? 因为你和他们不一样
And you know why? Because you're different.

208
00:10:10,391 --> 00:10:15,321
现在, 你要么自怨自艾
Now, I suppose you could learn to love yourself for the unique little snowflake that you are,

209
00:10:15,322 --> 00:10:19,605
要么... 你可以改变你的性格，这样比较简单
or... you could change your entire personality, which is just so much easier.

210
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:25,636
改变个性? 太糟糕了，而且也不能激励人
Change your personality? That is so awful, and not at all motivational.

211
00:10:25,637 --> 00:10:28,348
没必要 好吧, 开始, 我很沮丧
Not necessarily. Okay, at first, I was appalled,

212
00:10:28,349 --> 00:10:33,390
但是后来我发现这就象Aurelia Birnholz
Vasquez博士在猩猩中生活一样
but then I realized it's just like Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-Vasquez in Life Among the Gorillas.

213
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:37,782
要变的跟它们一样，才能的到群体的认同
I have to gain the acceptance of the herd by behaving exactly like one of them.

214
00:10:37,783 --> 00:10:40,558
这是个人类学课题 酷不?
It's an anthropological study. Isn't that cool?

215
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:42,799
这听起来更象外界压力吧
It  sounds kinda like peer pressure.

216
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,949
不, 不, 不 这绝对是人类学
No, no, no. It's totally anthropological

217
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:48,071
而且我就在做这件很酷的事
and it's cool and I'm doing it.

218
00:10:48,072 --> 00:10:52,178
耶, 我确定这就是外界压力
我们每年都有同学聚会
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's peer pressure. 
We have an assembly every year.

219
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:56,028
我是在扮演向外界压力屈从的人
I'm portraying someone who succumbs to peer pressure.

220
00:10:56,029 --> 00:11:01,161
好吧, 如果这些家伙逼你抽烟，你会怎么说?
All right, but if those guys try to pressure you to smoke, what do you say?

221
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:03,518
- 除非我喝醉了
- 乖孩子
- Only when I'm drunk.
- Good boy.

222
00:11:04,338 --> 00:11:08,492
所以, 要和猩猩一起生活
Marshall首先得做的像猩猩
And so, to fit in with the gorillas, Marshall had to learn to act like a gorilla,

223
00:11:08,493 --> 00:11:10,692
这就意味着学习猩猩课程
and that meant gorilla lessons.

224
00:11:10,693 --> 00:11:13,475
好了, 我真兴奋
Okay, I'm psyched about this.

225
00:11:13,476 --> 00:11:16,258
但如果我要来教你，我得知道你现在也很兴奋
But if I'm going to mentor you, I need to know you're psyched about this, too.

226
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,682
噢, 我是 我是很兴奋
Oh, I am. I'm, I'm psyched.

227
00:11:18,683 --> 00:11:22,148
耶, 但是不仅要说，还要表现出你很兴奋
Yeah, but it's one thing to say it, it's another thing to show it.

228
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:24,933
秀出来
Show it.

229
00:11:28,428 --> 00:11:29,583
我很兴奋!
I'm psyched!

230
00:11:30,888 --> 00:11:32,038
那是什么?
What was that?

231
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:40,696
Marshall, 我要感觉到大把的激情冲击过来
Marshall, I should feel tremors of psychitude rock my body like a seizure.

232
00:11:40,697 --> 00:11:44,895
就象一只被去掉猫爪的怀孕了的猫
That was like a declawed pregnant cat on a porch swing idly swatting

233
00:11:44,896 --> 00:11:47,728
在周六下午懒散的躺在秋千上拍苍蝇
at a fly on a lazy Sunday afternoon.

234
00:11:48,629 --> 00:11:50,642
哇, 讲的真精辟
Wow, that was really specific.

235
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,747
给我看看你的激情!
Show me you're psyched!

236
00:11:55,326 --> 00:11:56,878
来吧!
Let's do this!

237
00:11:57,224 --> 00:11:59,687
- 啊! 真痛!
- 确实
- Ow! That hurt!
- So badly.

238
00:12:00,297 --> 00:12:05,232
然后你小心的把这个在握手时给他就搞定了
And then you slip it to the guy with a discreet handshake and he'll get it done.

239
00:12:05,246 --> 00:12:06,980
好的 搞定什么?
Right. Get what done?

240
00:12:06,981 --> 00:12:08,030
随便什么
Whatever.

241
00:12:08,031 --> 00:12:08,935
酷
Cool.

242
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,297
那搞定哪个家伙呢?
And what guy is this?

243
00:12:10,442 --> 00:12:11,810
总会有的
There's always a guy.

244
00:12:11,811 --> 00:12:15,454
好了, 好的, 呃, 我想我准备好了
Okay, all right, I, uh, I think I'm ready.

245
00:12:15,455 --> 00:12:18,444
确定? 你要再练习一遍吗?
You sure? You want to practice your story one more time?

246
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,327
好吧
All right.

247
00:12:23,094 --> 00:12:27,274
那伙计, 听着 我和两个Kappa的员工在圣地亚哥
So dude, check it. I'm in San Diego with two of my bro-sephs from Kappa,

248
00:12:27,275 --> 00:12:31,152
他们说, "哟, Eriksen我们去脱衣舞俱乐部吧"
and they're all, "Yo, Eriksen, let's roll to the strip clubs."

249
00:12:31,153 --> 00:12:33,364
然后我说, "说干就干!"
So I'm, like, "Snapadoo!"

250
00:12:33,365 --> 00:12:35,905
所以我们找到了机场附近的黄窝...
So we find this choice nudie nest near the airport...

251
00:12:35,906 --> 00:12:38,786
...就在这时保镖把我们赶出来了
...and that is when the bouncer kicked us out.

252
00:12:38,787 --> 00:12:44,910
现在我也不知道Svetlana拿到绿卡没
但伙计们, 假钻戒?
Now, I have no idea if Svetlana ever got her green card, 
but dudes, fake diamond ring?

253
00:12:44,911 --> 00:12:46,932
绝对物超所值, 兄弟
Worth every penny, bruh.

254
00:12:48,086 --> 00:12:49,335
Eriksen...
Eriksen...

255
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:53,474
...绝对是牛肉酱!
...that was steak sauce!

256
00:12:57,001 --> 00:12:58,378
好故事
Great story.

257
00:13:09,859 --> 00:13:14,566
第二天早晨我订去德国的机票时收到一封邮件
The next moning, I was about to buy my ticket to Germany when I got an e-mail.

258
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,042
啊哦
Uh-oh.

259
00:13:16,043 --> 00:13:18,281
"嘿, Ted, 抱歉昨晚错过了你的电话
"Hey, Ted, sorry I missed your call last night.

260
00:13:18,282 --> 00:13:20,595
异地恋真糟糕, 是不?
This long-distance thing sucks, huh?

261
00:13:20,596 --> 00:13:23,509
听着, 我考虑了下，我今晚需要和你谈谈
Listen, I've been thinking and I really need to talk to you tonight.

262
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,437
我晚上十一点打给你 Victoria"
I'll call you at 11:00. Victoria."

263
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:26,879
所以?
So?

264
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,119
所以她要甩了我
So she's going to dump me.

265
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,802
有人会在说过, "听着, 我考虑了下"
Has anyone ever said, "Listen, I've been thinking,"

266
00:13:30,803 --> 00:13:32,358
然后接着说的是好消息吗?
and then follow it up with something good?

267
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:36,665
不是像: 听着, 我考虑了下果仁奶油饼干是评价较低的饼干
It's not like: Listen, I've been thinking, Nutter-Butters are an underrated cookie.

268
00:13:37,306 --> 00:13:38,550
还能是什么呢?
What else can it be?

269
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:41,606
有什么她不能在邮件里说而要打电话的?
What could she possibly have to say to me that she couldn't write in an e-mail?

270
00:13:41,644 --> 00:13:43,343
我手指被切掉了?
I cut off all my fingers?

271
00:13:44,965 --> 00:13:48,993
Ted, 你是个不错的家伙，我知, 你知, 她也知
Ted, you're a great guy. I know it, you know it, she knows it.

272
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:52,578
我愿意赌上大把的钱
不, 我应该更自信点
I would bet you a gazillion dollars，
no, I'm even more confident.

273
00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:56,619
我赌上所有的钱 她不是打电话说要和你分手
I would bet you a floppity jillion dollars that she's not calling to break up with you.

274
00:13:56,619 --> 00:13:59,286
谢谢 你是对的 我要疯了
Thanks. You're right. I'm being crazy.

275
00:13:59,287 --> 00:14:01,039
所以我还是去买机票, 是不?
So I should still buy that plane ticket, right?

276
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,259
我会等等看
I'd wait.

277
00:14:04,557 --> 00:14:07,275
在吃饭吗, Blauman? 我是电子炸弹
Sup, Blauman? E-bomb here.

278
00:14:07,276 --> 00:14:09,061
我们要去卡拉ok吗?
We still on for karaoke?

279
00:14:09,394 --> 00:14:14,239
伙计 我要用麦克风震的你喷鼻血
Dope. I'm going to rock you on the mike so hard your hears are going to bleed gravy.

280
00:14:14,502 --> 00:14:17,328
到时见, 屁股仔!
Catch you on the flip, butt puppet.

281
00:14:17,892 --> 00:14:18,912
好了...
Okay...

282
00:14:20,897 --> 00:14:22,439
...怎么样?
...what do you think?

283
00:14:22,784 --> 00:14:24,201
牛肉酱
Steak sauce.

284
00:14:24,817 --> 00:14:26,490
牛肉酱?
Steak sauce?

285
00:14:26,539 --> 00:14:27,849
耶
Yeah.

286
00:14:28,073 --> 00:14:32,517
不管你用什么人类学在工作上都不关我的事
Look, you know, whatever anthropology you do at work is your business,

287
00:14:32,518 --> 00:14:35,626
但别在家里也这样
but please don't act like that around here.

288
00:14:35,636 --> 00:14:38,102
Lily, 当Aurelia Birnholz博士...
Lily, when Dr. Aurelia Birnholz...

289
00:14:38,103 --> 00:14:42,867
不对, 当Australia Birdbath-Vaseline博士
从猩猩们那里回来时
No, when Dr. Australia Birdbath-Vaseline came home from the gorillas,

290
00:14:42,868 --> 00:14:48,112
她不会到处抓人们头发上的虱子和乱丢粪便
she didn't run around picking nits out of people's hair and-and throwing feces.

291
00:14:48,231 --> 00:14:51,634
我求你把这些留在办公室吧
I'm begging you just, just leave it at the office.

292
00:14:51,635 --> 00:14:52,508
为什么?
Why?

293
00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:56,506
因为你表现的和那些家伙一样
这些家伙很讨厌
Because you're acting like one of those guys, 
and those guys are lame.

294
00:14:56,507 --> 00:14:59,345
好吧, 他们开始是对我很刻薄
Okay, those guys were mean at first, yes,

295
00:14:59,346 --> 00:15:03,199
但他们是不错的人，如果你去了解下他们就会知道了
but they're actually good guys, and if you got to know them, then you would see that.

296
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:09,466
今晚和我们一起去卡拉ok你就会发现他们没那么讨厌了, 好不?
Come karaoke with us tonight, and you'll see how totally not that lame they are, okay?

297
00:15:09,665 --> 00:15:11,001
好吧
Okay.

298
00:15:11,415 --> 00:15:14,878
但等等, 咚咚, 后门有人敲门, 是谁呢?
But wait, knock-knock, back door, who's there?

299
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:19,264
Angelina Jolie... 等下，坐在轮椅里
Angelina Jolie... wait, in a wheelchair.

300
00:15:19,265 --> 00:15:21,195
你会怎样? 回答
What do you do? Go.

301
00:15:21,196 --> 00:15:24,595
伙计, 缺胳膊的Scarlett Johannsen每天都有
Dude, Scarlett Johannsen with no arms, any day of the week.

302
00:15:24,976 --> 00:15:25,961
耶
Yeah.

303
00:15:26,174 --> 00:15:28,800
你对了 他们真是不错
You're right. They're delightful.

304
00:15:29,922 --> 00:15:31,329
那Barney, 你要唱吗?
So, Barney, you gonna sing anything?

305
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,677
不要了 我玩腻卡拉ok了
Nah. I'm so over karaoke.

306
00:15:33,678 --> 00:15:36,038
是吗? 我以为你很喜欢玩这个
Really? I thought you'd be totally into it.

307
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:39,583
噢, 别理解错了 我唱的很好，最好的, 真的
Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm good. The best, really.

308
00:15:39,628 --> 00:15:44,236
我是让刀锈在鞘里的最伟大的武士
But it's the greatest samurai who lets his sword rust in its scabbard.

309
00:15:44,254 --> 00:15:46,213
噢, 宝贝, 这儿有我们的歌
Oh, baby, they have our song.

310
00:15:46,214 --> 00:15:48,327
我们来唱"别伤我的心"吧
Let's do "Don't Go Breaking My Heart."

311
00:15:48,393 --> 00:15:49,512
什么?
What?

312
00:15:49,513 --> 00:15:52,202
"别伤我的心"Elton John和Kiki Dee唱的
"Don't Go Breaking My Heart." Elton John, Kiki Dee.

313
00:15:52,203 --> 00:15:55,150
没门 你们得唱黑色安息日乐队的歌
No way. You got to go with some Black Sabbath.

314
00:15:55,151 --> 00:15:57,761
恩, 事实上, Marshall和我还有段小舞蹈
Well, actually, Marshall and I have this little dance routine.

315
00:15:57,762 --> 00:16:00,395
"机器人" 我可以唱 "机器人"
"Iron Man." I could do "Iron Man."

316
00:16:00,396 --> 00:16:01,382
牛肉酱
Steak sauce.

317
00:16:01,383 --> 00:16:02,891
牛肉酱, 伙计
Steak sauce, dude.

318
00:16:03,909 --> 00:16:05,145
我们要告诉他吗?
Should we tell him?

319
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,774
好了, Eriksen, 我有个好消息
All right, Eriksen, I've got some good news.

320
00:16:07,775 --> 00:16:11,595
周一, Bilson和我要和人力部的Montague谈
On Monday, Bilson and I are going to talk to Montague in HR.

321
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:15,413
你毕业后，我们想请你和我们一起工作
When you graduate, we want you working with us.

322
00:16:15,521 --> 00:16:16,831
你说什么?
What do you say?

323
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,772
- 好!
- 这才是我们的男人!
- Yes!
- That's my man!

324
00:16:23,773 --> 00:16:25,013
我就说他会的
I told you he would.

325
00:16:26,356 --> 00:16:28,291
啊, 我们要称霸办公室了
Aw, we're gonna own the office.

326
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:34,491
好吧, 太讨厌了
Okay, that was gross.

327
00:16:34,492 --> 00:16:37,924
你准备什么时候告诉我你改变了你整个就业计划?
When were you going to tell me you changed your entire career path?

328
00:16:37,925 --> 00:16:41,348
没有什么改变了, 好吗?我还是想支持环保事业
Nothing has changed, okay? I still want to help the environment.

329
00:16:41,349 --> 00:16:44,593
我只是在想也许我可以先挣几年钱
I just thought that maybe I could make some money for a few years.

330
00:16:44,594 --> 00:16:48,552
可以买间公寓，把我们的孩子送进好学校
We could buy an apartment, send our kids to good schools.

331
00:16:48,553 --> 00:16:50,655
你可以不用工作, 专心绘画
You could quit your job and focus on your painting.

332
00:16:50,655 --> 00:16:52,764
我知道你说你不需要, 但是...
I know that you say you don't need it, but...

333
00:16:52,765 --> 00:16:56,112
我爱你如论如何都想给你这些
I love you and I want to give it to you anyway.

334
00:16:56,113 --> 00:16:58,117
我想给你挣来那些福利
I want to give you the package.

335
00:16:58,118 --> 00:17:02,123
福利?! 你已经给我了福利了
The package?! You've already given me the package.

336
00:17:02,124 --> 00:17:05,851
你给了我很棒的福利 Marshall
我喜欢你的"福利"
You've got a great package, Marshall. 
I love your package.

337
00:17:05,851 --> 00:17:11,689
Lily, 你是让人难以置信的女人，你应该享有一份"大福利"
Lily, you're the most incredible woman I know, and you deserve a big package.

338
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:14,902
你的"福利"一直都够大了
Your package has always been big enough.

339
00:17:15,415 --> 00:17:18,083
也许你没意识到, Marshall Eriksen
You may not realize this, Marshall Eriksen,

340
00:17:18,084 --> 00:17:20,916
但你有个硕大的"福利"
but you've got a huge package.

341
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:27,737
是啊
Yeah.

342
00:17:32,328 --> 00:17:33,256
喂
Hello.

343
00:17:33,257 --> 00:17:34,308
她怎么还没打来?
Why hasn't she called yet?

344
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:36,981
好了, 你要把自己逼疯了，现在是周六晚上
Okay, you're making yourself crazy. It's Saturday night.

345
00:17:36,982 --> 00:17:38,072
出去干点什么
Go out and do something.

346
00:17:38,073 --> 00:17:41,893
不, 我出去干什么?
我有女朋友了... 到现在为止
No, what's the point of going out? 
I got a girlfriend... for now.

347
00:17:41,934 --> 00:17:44,505
另外, 如果我出去了, 谁看你播的新闻?
我相当于你的一半观众
Besides, if I go out, who's going to watch the news? 
I'm, like, half your viewership.

348
00:17:44,506 --> 00:17:46,955
我真荣幸你认为我有两个观众
I'm flattered you think we have two viewers.

349
00:17:47,388 --> 00:17:50,088
她不会和你分手的，Ted 你很棒
She's not going to break up with you, Ted. You're awesome.

350
00:17:50,089 --> 00:17:51,276
谢谢
Thanks.

351
00:17:51,443 --> 00:17:53,856
不管怎样, 11:00点了 我得让你挂了
Anyway, it's almost 11:00. I should let you go.

352
00:17:53,857 --> 00:17:55,009
祝你好运
Break a leg.

353
00:17:55,010 --> 00:18:00,277
然后我坐在家里, 等着电话响，我想到了什么
And so I was sitting at home, waiting for the phone to ring, something occurred to me.

354
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:04,442
我就真在这坐着一直等着电话响
I'm actually sitting at home waiting for the phone to ring.

355
00:18:06,655 --> 00:18:09,487
He's giving you the blues
He's giving you the blues

356
00:18:09,979 --> 00:18:13,447
You want to graduate, but not in his bed
You want to graduate, but not in his bed

357
00:18:13,448 --> 00:18:16,064
Here's what you got to do
Here's what you got to do

358
00:18:16,748 --> 00:18:18,330
Pick up the phone...
Pick up the phone...

359
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:19,433
Marshall
Marshall.

360
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,426
嘿, 嘿
Hey, hey.

361
00:18:21,427 --> 00:18:23,309
伙计, 我好象一个月没见你了
Dude, I feel like I haven't seen you in a month.

362
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,241
耶
Yeah.

363
00:18:24,873 --> 00:18:25,894
耶
Yeah.

364
00:18:26,037 --> 00:18:27,268
过的怎么样?
How are you doing?

365
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:30,246
我想Victoria要和我分手了
I think Victoria's about to break up with me.

366
00:18:30,247 --> 00:18:32,389
噢, 天那, 抱歉, 伙计
Oh, God, I'm sorry, man.

367
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:37,473
耶, 嗯, 说实话，我连想起她的长相都有困难了
Yeah, well, honestly, I'm having trouble remembering what she looks like.

368
00:18:38,107 --> 00:18:40,447
越努力去想, 越想不出来
The more I try to picture her, the more I can't.

369
00:18:40,448 --> 00:18:42,024
就象, 我还记得她给我的感觉
Like, I remember how she makes me feel.

370
00:18:42,025 --> 00:18:45,248
我只是不能完全的回忆起她的样貌
I just... I don't completely remember her.

371
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:48,063
就象我在试图留住一些已经逝去了的东西
It's like I'm trying to preserve something that's already gone.

372
00:18:48,486 --> 00:18:50,369
留住一些已经逝去了的东西
Preserving something that's already gone.

373
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,349
听起来象环境保护法
Sounds like environmental law.

374
00:18:53,239 --> 00:18:54,557
我不知道
I don't know.

375
00:18:54,709 --> 00:18:57,334
我们用尽全力去保住这些
We struggle so hard to hold onto these things

376
00:18:57,335 --> 00:18:59,637
注定最终会消逝的东西
that we know are going to disappear eventually.

377
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,298
这样是很高尚
And that's really noble,

378
00:19:01,471 --> 00:19:04,877
但如果你救回了每一片变成停车场的雨林
but even if you save every rainforest from being turned into a parking lot,

379
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:08,545
嗯, 那我们把车停哪儿呢?
well, then where are you going to park your car?

380
00:19:16,164 --> 00:19:17,677
Done dirt cheap!
Done dirt cheap!

381
00:19:17,678 --> 00:19:19,298
Dirty deeds
Dirty deeds

382
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:20,942
Done dirt cheap!
Done dirt cheap!

383
00:19:20,943 --> 00:19:22,770
Dirty deeds
Dirty deeds

384
00:19:22,771 --> 00:19:24,427
Done dirt cheap!
Done dirt cheap!

385
00:19:24,428 --> 00:19:27,960
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap, ow
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap, ow

386
00:19:27,961 --> 00:19:31,474
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap...
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap...

387
00:19:31,925 --> 00:19:34,701
啊, 正要到高潮. 伙计, 什么...?
Uh,  rockupied. Dude, what...?

388
00:19:38,479 --> 00:19:42,583
下一首, 棉花糖和百合花
Next up, Marshmallow and Lillypad.

389
00:19:54,867 --> 00:19:57,432
Don't go breakin' my heart
Don't go breakin' my heart

390
00:19:58,421 --> 00:20:00,814
I couldn't if I tried
I couldn't if I tried

391
00:20:02,345 --> 00:20:05,439
Honey, if I get restless
Honey, if I get restless

392
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,817
Baby, you're not that kind...
Baby, you're not that kind...

393
00:20:08,056 --> 00:20:10,597
似乎还是有些东西值得去挽留的
It turns out some things are worth preserving.

394
00:20:10,598 --> 00:20:12,140
但是还有个问题
But here's the real question:

395
00:20:12,141 --> 00:20:15,113
凌晨两点 朋友们还在外面唱卡拉
It's 2:00 a.m. Your friends are still out singing karaoke,

396
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:19,217
但你却得提前回家等着本应该四个小时前
but you're home early because you're expecting a call from your girlfriend in Germany,

397
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,656
打来的在德国的女友的电话
who was supposed to call four hours ago.

398
00:20:21,657 --> 00:20:24,199
然后电话响了
And then the phone rings.

399
00:20:27,355 --> 00:20:28,317
喂
Hello.

400
00:20:28,318 --> 00:20:30,469
嗨, Ted 我是Robin
Hi, Ted. It's Robin.

401
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:34,005
呃, 听着, 我知道现在很晚了, 但, 呃
Um, listen, I know it's late, but, uh,

402
00:20:34,405 --> 00:20:36,171
你愿意过来吗?
do you want to come over?

403
00:20:36,689 --> 00:20:38,971
你会怎样? 回答
What do you do? Go.

404
00:20:39,797 --> 00:20:44,633
