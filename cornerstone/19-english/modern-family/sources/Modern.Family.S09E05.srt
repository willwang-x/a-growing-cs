23
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,370
瞧瞧你  打扮得像个女孩  为何改变
Look at you, dressed like a girl. Why the change?

24
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,330
旱冰队又想招你去了吗
Did the roller-derby team try to recruit you again?

25
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,060
没有  我要跟本约会
No. I have a date with Ben.

26
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,860
感觉你看起来不是很乐意啊
You don't seem too excited about it.

27
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,280
他人是很好啦  而且...
Well, I mean, he's really nice, and --

28
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,160
懂  你觉得无聊了  我也是
Got it. You're bored, and so am I.

29
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,170
分手吧
Break up.

30
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,340
我就想看看外边还有何种男人
I mean, I just want to see what else is out there.

31
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,140
-我这样有错吗  -天啊
- Does that make me a bad person? ‭- Oh, my God.

32
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,240
我们还在讨论这个事情吗
Are we still talking about this?

33
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,960
我已经解决你的问题了  就今天
I solved your problem. Today.

34
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,100
找一家热闹的餐厅  免得他大吵大闹
Crowded restaurant so he doesn't make a scene.

35
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,850
深呼吸  然后直接跟他说了
Just deep breath and say it.

36
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:28,100
天大好消息  有人拿厕纸炸了我们家
Fantastic news! Someone TP'd our house!

37
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,710
万圣节狂欢正在逼近
Halloween fun is afoot.

38
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,090
老爸  我真心想为你感到兴奋
Dad, I really want to be excited for you,

39
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,590
可这是万圣节
but Halloween?

40
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,190
我们都已经老到可以投票了
We're almost old enough to vote.

41
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:38,760
吓到我了
Got me!

42
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:39,670
值得吗
Worth it?

43
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,960
怎么  你长大就不能让你害怕一下了吗
Oh, what, you're too old for a little scare?

44
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,730
最令人害怕的是你离当外婆可能只隔了
The scariest thing is you could be a cheap pick-up line,

45
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,630
一次搭讪  两瓶啤酒和九个月时间
two beers, and nine months away from being a grandparent,

46
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,400
而你却冒着窒息的风险躲在冰箱里
and you just risked asphyxiation in the fridge.

47
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,620
我们又不是带你们去敲门要糖果
It's not like we're taking you trick-or-treating.

48
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,020
成年人也有成年人过万圣节的方式啊
There are grown-up ways to enjoy Halloween.

49
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,630
南瓜船比赛怎么样
How about pumpkin-boat racing?

50
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,250
小卡以前在密苏里州常做
Cam used to do it in Missouri.

51
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,530
找一个巨大的南瓜
Take a giant pumpkin,

52
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:57,710
去顶
cut the top off,

53
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,960
去瓤  坐进  开划
gut it, hop in, sail away.

54
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,850
来吧
Let's do it.

55
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,340
我爱死这个创意
I'm so married to this idea,

56
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,510
爱它到我跟人说笑话  它会像老婆一样翻白眼
it rolls its eyes when I make jokes in public.

57
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,580
学着点  也许能对你甩掉本带来帮助
Take notes -- This might help you out with Ben later.

58
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,190
老妈  老爸
Mom, Dad?

59
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,130
你们与万圣节
You and Halloween have had

60
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,970
曾一起度过无数欢乐时光
some great times together.

61
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,230
但如今物是人非
But it's over.

62
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,060
你们对过节来说太老了  令人不忍直视
You're way too old, and it's hard to look at.

63
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,780
跟你的事真的能串起来呢
Wow, it really lines up.

64
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,130
我知道怎么回事了
I see what's going on here.

65
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:18,970
谢天谢地
Thank God.

66
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:19,950
我还没有说
I haven't communicated how big

67
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,450
这南瓜会有多大
this pumpkin's gonna be.

68
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,080
听过童书《超级红卜卜》那只两层楼高的狗吗
You guys know Clifford -- the Big Red Dog?

69
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,940
我们不想玩
We're not doing this.

70
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:25,980
而且  我们都有约会了
Plus, we all have dates.

71
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,680
-但是  -我觉得他们过那年纪了
- But-- -I think they're past it.

72
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,320
有点太残酷了  对吧
That was kinda harsh, huh?

73
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,830
亲爱的  你别太往心里去
Oh, honey, don't take it too personally.

74
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,050
我吗  明显是针对你的啊  冰箱怪物
Me? That was directed at you, fridge monster.

75
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,940
你才是痴迷过万圣节的人啊
You're the one who's obsessed with Halloween.

76
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,610
亲爱的  是你建议
Honey, you were the one who suggested

77
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:38,830
找一个巨大的南瓜
getting a giant pumpkin

78
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,040
然后让我们坐在里面划船
and having us sail away in it

79
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,480
像是动画里的老鼠一家
like a family of cartoon mice.

80
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,450
所有南瓜对老鼠来说都是巨大的
All pumpkins are giant to mice.

81
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,470
我们俩争谁更迷恋一个
There is no use in us arguing over who's more obsessed

82
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,270
已经离我们远去的节日毫无意义
with a holiday that's behind us already.

83
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,620
离我们可远了
Way behind us.

84
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,780
好了  我得走了  亲爱的
All right. I got to get going, honey.

85
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,070
对  今天过得开心哦
Yeah, have a good one.

86
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,690
-很好  拜拜  -拜
- Great. Buh-bye. - Mm-hmm, bye.

87
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,090
计划有变  各位
Change of plans, fellas.

88
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,160
快上车
Hop in the car.

89
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,120
哎哟哟
Well, well, well.

90
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,840
你们城里人
You city folk

91
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,080
起得可真晚啊
sure are late risers.

92
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,780
我猜你们的公鸡有个稍候再叫的按钮
I guess your rooster has a snooze button.

93
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,370
你每天都说一模一样的话好搞笑哦
It's funny how you say the exact, same thing every morning.

94
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,870
由于我们的包工头暂停维修我们的厨房
Since our contractor took a break from rehabbing kitchens

95
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,290
-改成"修"身养性去戒赌  -对
- to rehab a gambling problem... - Yeah.

96
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,070
杰就接手了  我们就开始住在这儿
...Jay took over, and we've been staying here.

97
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,300
老爸花了不少时间精力
It's been a lot of Dad,

98
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,190
但是... 继续住在家里
but it -- it just became too impractical

99
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,810
变得太不方便了
to continue living at home.

100
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,850
我们需要再涂一层亮光漆
We're gonna use another coat of varnish.

101
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,990
味道应该不会太重
The fumes shouldn't be too noticeable.

102
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,450
-好  -天啊  莉莉
- Okay. - Okay. Oh, boy. Lily.

103
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,380
天啊  她被熏倒了
Oh, gosh! Okay, she's down!

104
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,690
我们住在没有厨房的地方很不容易
It's been hard on us, living without a kitchen.

105
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,170
厨房烧了已经过了六周
It's been, uh, six weeks now since it burned down.

106
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,100
从你把厨房烧了
Since you burned it down.

107
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,520
从我把厨房烧了
Since I burned it down.

108
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,420
还蓄意让我以为是我干的
And then maliciously made me think I did it

109
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,570
然后利用我的自责谋取你的私利
and leveraged my guilt for your own selfish gain.

110
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:58,810
还蓄意让你以为
Then maliciously made you think

111
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,360
是你干的  然后利用...
that you did it, and leveraged --

112
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,670
亲爱的  你不要再自责了
Honey, you got to stop beating yourself up.

113
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,660
好吧
Okay.

114
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,610
我要给乔做燕麦粥
I was going to make Joe's oatmeal.

115
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,310
你真的有必要把五个炉子都占着吗
Do you really have to use all five burners?

116
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,150
这道菜就叫
Well, it is called

117
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,590
五个炉子肉馅饼
Five Burner Meat Pie,

118
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,570
是我们那里的万圣佳节传统菜肴
and it's the traditional dish back at the Halloween festival,

119
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,850
让我感觉像在老家过节
so it kinda makes me feel like I'm there.

120
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,330
燕麦粥还没好吗
No oatmeal?

121
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,710
我不等了  把胡子戴上吧
Guess I could put my beard on now.

122
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,460
快来
Come over here!

123
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,430
有点疼  对不起  但是我崇拜的上帝
Look, I'm sorry, but the God I worship

124
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,380
是不会露出他自己的发根的  所以...
does not let his roots show, so...

125
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,120
两周前
Two weeks ago,

126
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,440
我们邀请米奇和小卡来这边住
we invited Mitch and Cam to stay here.

127
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,860
是你邀请的
You invited them.

128
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,490
对我们来说绝非易事
It's been hard on us,

129
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,640
但我们哥伦比亚人的传统
but it's part of our Colombian heritage...

130
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,850
是你的传统
Your heritage.

131
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,340
就是欢迎家人
...to welcome family

132
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,120
绝对不赶他们出去
and to never kick them out,

133
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,580
即便有时候他们也许有一些越界行为
even when they might have some boundary issues.

134
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,550
我回工地了
I'm heading back to the job site.

135
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,190
我打算让伙计们休息一会儿
Gonna let the guys knock off

136
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,910
请他们喝点儿小酒
for a little liqu-or-treating.

137
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,020
团队就应该这样...
Well, that is how you manage...

138
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,680
才能把活拖到圣诞节才干完
...to stretch a job until Christmas.

139
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,020
好了  你现在过去
Okay, you need to go over there,

140
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,390
问问他还要修多久
find out how long this is gonna take.

141
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,110
我想把我的厨房要回来 
I want my kitchen back.

142
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,720
好吧  老爸
Okay, uh, Dad?

143
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,570
我们很感激你的辛勤工作
W-We appreciate all your hard work,

144
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,790
但是我们的进度好像有点落后了
but we're running a little past schedule.

145
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,190
活总得干完才算完啊
The job is done when the job is done.

146
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,190
你们想要快的话
You want it faster,

147
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,100
下次烧个书架好了
next time, burn down a bookshelf.

148
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,070
很明显他根本就不会弄
Well, clearly, he doesn't know what he's doing

149
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,040
而且骄傲得不肯承认
and he's too proud to admit it.

150
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:13,960
我知道  我知道
I know. I know.

151
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,570
我的早餐就是一根女人能量棒吗
My breakfast is a LUNA Bar for women.

152
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:18,860
想点办法啊
Do something.

153
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,320
他们是家人啊  你想要我怎么办
They're family. What do you want me to do?

154
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,510
你得开了你父亲
You need to fire your father.

155
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,120
别担心  我会处理的
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

156
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,860
-米奇尔  -我对天发誓
- Mitchell. ‭- I swear to God.

157
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,170
答应我  你会把他们赶走
Promise me you'll get rid of them.

158
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,160
好
Okay.

159
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,900
要让我相信你
Make me believe it.

160
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,600
我对你发誓
I swear to you.

161
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,260
我不是跟男人约会
I didn't have a date with a guy,

162
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,410
而是跟德丝蒂尼[命运]约会了
but rather a date with Destiny.

163
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,060
德丝蒂尼是我参加的视镜的
Destiny was the name of the casting director

164
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:38,900
选角导演
I was auditioning for.

165
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,220
我看到一则招聘邮轮和声歌手广告
I saw an ad for backup singers on a cruise ship,

166
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,470
我立刻知道是缘分来了
and I knew it was fate.

167
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,960
我有天籁般的嗓音  又喜欢唱K
I have a killer voice, I love karaoke,

168
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,390
更擅长在船上派对
and I'm great at partying on boats.

169
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,590
海莉·邓菲
Haley Dunphy?

170
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,620
啊嘿[船员用词]
Ahoy!

171
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,450
我会说"船语"哦
I speak "Ship."

172
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,220
一路顺风哦  船友们
Bon voyage, mateys.

173
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,210
技惊四座
I crushed it.

174
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,820
连我的谦逊都是秒杀全场
I even crushed the modesty after.

175
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,790
"不  谢谢你们给我这次演唱机会"
"No, thank you for the chance to sing."

176
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,030
贝丝和杰西卡
Beth and Jessica...

177
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,370
-拜拜  -你俩留下
- Bye. - ‭...you guys stay.

178
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,930
海莉  我们再联系吧
Haley, we'll be in touch.

179
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,540
知道你俩是
I had a good feeling about you two

180
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,960
卡帕姐妹会的之后  我就很看好你们
when I found out you were fellow Kappa sisters.

181
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:11,820
等下
Wait.

182
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,660
你们是一个姐妹会的吗
You're all in the same sorority?

183
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,480
是最棒的姐妹会
Only the best sorority.

184
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,310
卡帕  卡帕  塞塔
Kappa Kappa Theta!

185
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,970
-我想要...  -行了行了
- Ooh, I wanna take ya - Okay, okay.

186
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,370
这就是大家都讨厌大学生的原因
This is why everyone hates college graduates.

187
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,660
我会走的
I will walk out that door,

188
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,760
但至少给我一点尊重
but at least show me enough respect to admit

189
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,190
承认这个决定根本和才华无关
that this decision had nothing to do with talent.

190
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,560
因为众所周知  我是最棒的
Because everyone knows that I was the best.

191
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,050
挺有勇气
Well, that took a lot of guts.

192
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,440
跟我来
Come with me.

193
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,260

00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:43,960

Okay. I've seen enough.

202
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:52,450
不  不  不
Oh, no, no, no.

203
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,930
我得忍着看完这一整段
I had to sit through this whole thing.

204
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,100
你也别想跑
You will, too.

205
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,060
你们要知道  这是60年代的
You got to remember, this was the '60s.

206
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,270
那时柜橱生意的竞争十分激烈
Competition in the closet game was fierce,

207
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,580
人们都在追逐下一个大存储的点子
everybody chasing after the next big storage idea.

208
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,520
历史学家称这段时期为空间战[太空竞赛]
Historians remember this period as the "Space race."

209
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:08,210

-米奇尔  -爸
- Oh, Mitchell. - Uh, Dad?

211
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,490
我想看下厨房
Uh, I would like to see the kitchen.

212
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,810
我倒想喝啤酒能让我的头发再生
I'd like to think that drinking beer makes my hair grow back,

213
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:12,840
但生活就是不公平的
but life ain't fair.

214
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,610
好吧  我们得谈谈
Okay, uh, then w-we need to talk.

215
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,700
你们先出去下
You guys want to take it outside?

216
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,840
我得跟小赫哥谈一下
I need a couple minutes with El Rojo.

217
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,870
赫就是"红色"
Rojo means "Red."

218
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:21,470
好吧
Yeah.

219
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,700
我组装东西很快  不像你的工人
I put things together quickly, unlike your workers,

220
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,150
这也是我来这里的原因
which is, uh, why I'm here.

221
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,550
爸  如果这活对你来说太难了...
Um, Dad, if this is too much for you --

222
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,720
等一下
Now, wait a second.

223
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,010
你不会是来炒我鱿鱼的吧
You're not here to fire me, are you?

224
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:29,970
什么  不是啦
What? No.

225
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,100
呵  那词太重了
Pfft! That's a strong word.

226
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,680
我这一生经历过太多炒鱿鱼
I've done enough axing in my time

227
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,060
我知道你这个表情
to recognize the look.

228
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:34,820
干脆点吧
Just do it.

229
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,010
我  我本来更希望
See, now, I was -- I was hoping

230
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,610
这更像是一场对话
this would be more of a conversation.

231
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,420
你跟人对质的功力一直很差
Never been much for confrontation.

232
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,140
你要是有本事打开天窗说亮话
You weren't engaged to a woman six months in law school

233
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,910
也不会上法学院时  跟一个女的订婚半年了
because you were good at dropping the hammer.

234
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,500
你们不是还一起养了猫吗
Didn't you guys get a cat together?

235
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,780
好了  没错
Okay, you know? Y-Y-Yes!

236
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,230
你被炒了  行了吧
You're fired! Okay?

237
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,810
你就是个没能力的戏精
You're an incompetent man-diva.

238
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,740
你唯一建过的一样东西
The only thing you've ever built

239
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,130
就是橱柜  也就是个装空气的盒子
is a closet -- I.E. a box of air.

240
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,220
你走吧
So get out,

241
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,460
小心你的大屁股
and don't let the door hit you

242
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,840
别被门夹了
on your ample behind.

243
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,200
不错
Nicely done.

244
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,160
不过对橱柜的攻击有些没必要
Maybe an unnecessary shot at closets,

245
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,620
毕竟你没出"柜"整整22年
particularly from someone who was in one for 22 years,

246
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,420
但
but...

247
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,850
我明白了
Yeah, I get it.

248
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,310
我去拿我的东西
I'll just grab my stuff.

249
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,500
天啊  爸  你弄完了
Oh, my God. Dad, it's -- it's done!

250
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,430
-对  -那你怎么不说呢
- Yep. - ‭Well, why didn't you say something?

251
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,730
我看到你怒气冲冲走进来
Well, I saw you marching in here,

252
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,790
感觉要发飙
loaded for bear.

253
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,110
而你很少对别人发飙
You don't usually go off on people,

254
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,260
我觉得让你发泄一下也好
so I thought it'd be good for you.

255
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,830
-感觉如何  -我不喜欢那种感觉
- How'd it feel? - ‭I didn't love it.

256
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,100
但这个厨房真是太赞了
But this kitchen is amazing.

257
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,430
我还剩一件事要做
I only got one more thing to do.

258
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,550
我得把玻璃装进门中  然后安装好门
I've got to seal glass in the door and hang it.

259
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,830
你想要那个彩色玻璃
Now, you want to go with the stain

260
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,760
还是小卡选的透明玻璃
or the clear pane Cam picked?

261
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,430
你知道吗  我是在跳蚤市场上买的这个
Hmm. You know what? I-I bought this at a flea market.

262
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,560
他们不知道是从哪来的
They're not sure of the origin.

263
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,130
可能来自毁于地震的
It either came from a 17th-century Flemish cathedral

264
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,520
17世纪弗兰芒教堂
that collapsed in an earthquake

265
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,750
也可能是中学生演音乐剧《修女》时的道具
or a high-school production of "Nunsense."

266
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,110
我真心喜欢这个
Oh, I do love this.

267
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,870
我是不是该问问小卡的意见
Should -- Should I ask Cam if it's okay?

268
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,340
你差点炒了你爸
You almost just fired your dad.

269
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,790
该不会在这事上犯怂吧
You're not gonna go shy on me on this --

270
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,600
你说得对
You know what? You're right.

271
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,080
就要这个了
It's this glass.

272
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,620
这就对了嘛
That's it. Hey?

273
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,290
你想不想帮我完成这个
You want to help me finish this off,

274
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,280
就咱俩
just the two of us?

275
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,140
你知道吗
You know what?

276
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,770
好的  我愿意
Yes. Yeah, I-I would.

277
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,860
让我系上这个
Let me just strap on this bad boy.

278
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,810
所有的工具都在地上摆好了
So, all the tools have been laid out.

279
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:06,840
接下来呢
What next?

280
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,970
-菲尔  -卡罗尔
- Phil. - Hey, Carol.

281
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,900
我刚知道我家小孩把你院子弄成这样
I just found out my kids did this to your yard,

282
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,760
实在很抱歉
and we are so sorry.

283
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,210
不用啦  万圣节嘛
Don't be. It's Halloween.

284
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,980
每年四大恶作剧日子之一
It's one of the four biggest prank days of the year.

285
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,740
万圣节  愚人节
It's this, April Fools' Day,

286
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,280
愚人节前一天
and the day before April Fools' Day,

287
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,730
因为没人会有防备
'cause no one sees it coming.

288
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:23,840
第四个呢
What's the fourth?

289
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:24,950
想得美  卡罗尔
Nice try, Carol.

290
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,100
重点是
The point is,

291
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,450
有一天你醒来
you're gonna wake up one morning

292
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,760
发现你家小孩不再恶作剧了
and find out that your kids don't TP anymore.

293
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,520
珍惜可爱的小坏蛋还作恶的日子吧
Cherish these days with your adorable little vandals.

294
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,080
感谢你的理解
Well, I appreciate the understanding,

295
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,900
但我想给他们点教训
but I'm trying to teach them a lesson.

296
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,940
我会给他们教训的
Oh, I'm gonna teach them a lesson,

297
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,210
因为报仇的时候到啦
'cause it's payback time.

298
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,770
恶作剧大战正式开始
Pranks wars have begun.

299
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:41,790
太棒了
Yes!

300
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:43,250
好了  孩子们
Okay, kids.

301
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,930
我想邓菲先生还有更重要的事要做
I think Mr. Dunphy has better things to do

302
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,840
才不会浪费时间和你们恶作剧大战
than spend his day in a prank war with you.

303
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,260
好消息  孩子们  我没事
Good news, boys. I don't.

304
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:50,940
好吧
Okay.

305
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,400
你完成不了作业
We cannot take you trick-or-treating

306
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,330
就不带你去讨糖
if you don't finish your homework.

307
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,930
你俩不是有话要说嘛
Didn't you two have something you wanted to talk about?

308
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,880
小卡
Um, so, Cam...

309
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,210
我正在试着连无线网
I'm trying to get Wi-Fi

310
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,480
这样才能看我老家的
so I can watch the pumpkin weigh-in

311
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,720
万圣节南瓜称重赛
at the Halloween festival back home.

312
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,950
25年前
You know, 25 years ago,

313
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,650
我培育了威奇托最大的南瓜
I raised the largest Wichita Thumper,

314
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,810
至今此记录还没被打破
and the record still stands.

315
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:10,910
多多包涵
I am so sorry.

316
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,370
这话怎么说都听起来像小卡卖瓜
There's no way to say that that doesn't sound braggy.

317
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,300
不不  你这么说还好啦
No, no, you just did fine.

318
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,720
但我想和你说
Um, but I just wanted to say to you --

319
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,340
每个南瓜  都有一个故事
You know, as with every pumpkin, there's a story.

320
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,610
那是一个寒冷的夜晚
It was a cold, bitter night,

321
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:25,140
窗户传来咚咚咚敲打的声音
when tap-tap-tap on the window.

322
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,550
惊奇的是居然是我南瓜的藤
Darn if it wasn't the vine of my pumpkin,

323
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,280
在外面摇晃
just out there trembling away.

324
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,770
真是个好故事
That is a great story.

325
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,560
然后  我爸就把南瓜
Next thing I know, Daddy's pulling the pumpkin

326
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,080
拉进了窗户  当然很小心  没弄断藤
through the window, careful, of course, not to break the vine.

327
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,310
之后几个月  它成为我家的一员
And for months, it just became a part of our household --

328
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,780
大家跨过它才能进厨房
people stepping over it to get into the kitchen,

329
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,070
它挡住了半个电视
blocked half the TV.

330
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:44,020
我们以为《脱线家族》
We thought "The Brady Bunch"

331
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,980
{\an8}一部拥有6个孩子的重组家庭故事

332
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,020
讲的是3个可爱女孩子的故事
was just about three lovely girls.

333
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,670
但没人抱怨
Oh, but nobody complained.

334
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,520
当然  我获得了总冠军
Sure, I won Grand Champion,

335
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,820
还得到下一个龙卷风的命名权
you know, and the right to name the next tornado.

336
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,060
但我印象最深的
But the thing I remember most

337
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:56,650
是我家人为我所做的牺牲
are the sacrifices my family made for just me.

338
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,890
这就是我家乡对待家人的方式
That's how we do family where I'm from.

339
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:03,040
我老家那也是这么对待家人的
That's how we do family where I am from!

340
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,400
歌洛莉亚  我得赶紧连上网
Oh, Gloria! I got to get this Wi-Fi.

341
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,220
你都看见了  是不是
You saw that, didn't you?

342
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,210
人在做天在看
I see everything.

343
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,310
你们十分钟后突袭办公室
In 10 minutes, you're gonna storm the office,

344
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,550
在所有人慌乱的时候
everybody freaks out,

345
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,870
我神奇女侠现身  击败丧尸
I go Wonder Woman, fight off the zombies.

346
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,910
-明白了  -好
- Got it. - ‭Okay.

347
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,500
我的孩子们或许不感兴趣了
My kids may be over it,

348
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,600
但办公室的大家喜欢万圣节克莱尔
but at the office, they love Halloween Claire.

349
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,040
这是在普里契特衣柜工作的好处之一
It's one of the perks of working at Pritchett's Closets.

350
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,080
虽然接下来一年你都得帮忙付咖啡钱
Sure, you got to pitch in for coffee the rest of the year,

351
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,920
但万圣节那天的大戏是免费的
but on October 31st, the show is free.

352
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,750
-大家马上就来开会了  -很好
- Everyone's on their way here to a meeting. - Great.

353
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,540
今年不搞角色扮演了吗
Oh, so, no costume this year?

354
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,510
应该不会
Apparently not.

355
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,540
明智之举
Oh, good call.

356
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,330
所有人都受不了
Everyone was so sick of it.

357
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,990
变装压力太大了
The pressure to dress up!

358
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,360
他们求我来和你谈谈来着
You know, they begged me to talk to you,

359
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,140
但我说  "不  克莱尔会意识到
but I said, "No, Claire will realize

360
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,940
大家有多不情愿的"
how miserable everybody is."

361
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,080
-这么说谁都  -我想喝你的...
- So no-nobody -- - I vant to drink your --

362
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,660
我们不用再搞角色扮演了
We don't have to do it anymore.

363
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,050
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God!

364
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,580
你知道我今早照镜子时哭了吗
You know, I cried in the mirror this morning?

365
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,470
大伙  大伙  都结束了
Guys, everybody. It's over.

366
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,960
终于不用再搞这一套了  别担心
The whole thing's finally over. No worries.

367
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:05,730
是啊
Yeah.

368
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,320
我先失陪片刻
I'm just gonna need a quick second.

369
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,610
不不不  别别别
No, no, no. Stop, stop, stop, stop.

370
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,640
-抱歉  -快走
- Sorry. - Go.

371
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,310
请各位
So, if you could just,

372
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,870
注意看屏幕
uh, take your attention to the screen, please.

373
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,760
市场调查表明...
And... for the market research --

374
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,360
拜托  没人想来这一出
Please. Nobody wants this.

375
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,000
她想给我们个惊喜
Oh, she's surprising us.

376
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,770
丧尸来袭了
It's a zombie attack.

377
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,780
万岁
Yay.

378
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:28,670
但神奇女侠来救我们了  太好了
Oh, but it's Wonder Woman to the rescue, yeah.

379
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,200
神奇女侠  救救我
Wonder Woman, help me.

380
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,500
好吧  好戏结束了
Okay, fun's over.

381
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,770
快点  都走吧
Come on. Everybody --

382
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:37,720
好吧  好吧
Okay! All right!

383
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,880
给你  拿走  拿走
Here! Take it! Take it!

384
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,490
天啊  我太抱歉了
Ow, God! I am so sorry!

385
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:42,890
你这么早就回来了
You're home early.

386
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,930
我本来与俱乐部一个叫艾比的女生打得火热
I was into this awesome girl, Abby, from the club.

387
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,540
我们本打算今晚进入下一个阶段
And tonight, we were gonna take things to the next level,

388
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,340
也就是  你懂  性
which is, you know, sex.

389
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,930
想个代号总是好的
Always classy to name it.

390
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,930
但问题是她特别善妒
But the one problem is she's super jealous

391
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,390
她貌似觉得我在和
and got this idea I was messing around

392
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,190
小卖部的卡拉胡搞
with Carla from the snack bar.

393
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:57,520
我的确有
Which I was.

394
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,760
所以我得在去见艾比前
So I had to break it off with Carla

395
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,830
和卡拉分手
before seeing Abby.

396
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:01,710
顺利吗
How'd it go?

397
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,430
她用食品夹把我一顿抽
I got a major tong lashing.

398
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,140
搞什么
What the heck?

399
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,600
卡拉  冷静点  等一下
Carla, calm down! Wait -- Oh!

400
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,530
等等  让我解释
Wait, wait, I can explain!

401
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,250
让我解释  谁来救救我
I can explain! Somebody help!

402
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,480
于是我遮住我的淤伤
So I covered up my bruises

403
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,440
清理了所有和小卖部有关的证据
and checked for any snack-bar-related evidence

404
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,540
才去见艾比
before seeing Abby.

405
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,690
抱歉我迟到了
Sorry I'm late.

406
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,330
我传你的照片时扭伤了脖子
I got whiplash passing a picture of you.

407
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:22,820
事情进展得不能更顺利了
Things couldn't have been going any better...

408
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,690
我爸肯定会讨厌死你
My dad is going to hate you.

409
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:27,800
然后变得更顺利了
...and then they got better.

410
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,390
直到...
Until...

411
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,450
芥末
Mustard?

412
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,000
你分明讨厌芥末
You hate mustard.

413
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,180
你个王八蛋  你又去和卡拉胡搞了
You son of a bitch! You were with Carla!

414
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,730
我知道有完美金句
I knew there was one perfect thing

415
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,080
说出来就能挽救大局
I could say to save it.

416
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,540
宝贝  她不过是小卖部零食
Baby, I just snack with her.

417
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,830
你才是主菜
You're the main course.

418
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,000
我真的只是引用别人的话
I did not come up with that thing.

419
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,350
好了
All right.

420
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,570
看起来不错
Looks good.

421
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,870
这是我帮忙装好的
You know, I helped build that.

422
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,650
我感觉像个真的建筑工人呢
I-I feel like a real construction guy.

423
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:53,140
我有点希望此时能路过个女人
I kinda wish a woman would walk by

424
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,560
好让我说点物化女性的话
so I could objectify her.

425
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,640
那最爽了
It's the best.

426
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,310
我们刚刚完成了一项工程
Listen, we just finished the project.

427
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,330
来  和你老爹去逛一圈庆祝胜利
Now, come on. Take a victory lap with your old man.

428
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:00,960
乐意奉陪
I'd love to.

429
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,570
我倒要看看小卡
Hey, and I defy Cam to find

430
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:03,730
能挑出这玻璃什么毛病来
anything wrong with that window.

431
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,800
它真的为你的厨房添色不少
It really gives your kitchen some flair.

432
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:09,420
歌洛莉亚
Oh, hey, Gloria.

433
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,540
我终于找到无线网信号最好的地方了
I finally found a great spot for the Wi-Fi

434
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,460
正好赶上南瓜称重
just in time for the pumpkin weigh-in.

435
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,670
我泡澡时你居然坐在这
You sit here while I take a bath?!

436
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,200
你忘了我是基吗
I'm gay? Hello?

437
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,130
我对你这件华美的浴袍更感兴趣
I'm more fixated on that fabulous robe.

438
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,360
我下次泡澡时绝对要借来穿
I am so borrowing that for my next bath.

439
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,170
你洗澡水还没放掉吧
You didn't drain the water yet, did you?

440
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,230
好吧  够了
Okay, that's it!

441
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,990
我再也受不了你了
I can't handle you anymore!

442
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,130
你占据我的厨房
You take over my kitchen!

443
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:30,320
我一转身  你就蹬鼻子上脸
I turn around, and you're in my face!

444
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,860
连体婴都比我有更多个人空间
Siamese twins have more privacy than me!

445
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,420
从我家滚出去  再也别回来了
Get out of my house, and never come back!

446
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,990
厨房装修好了
Well, the kitchen's done.

447
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:42,120
看来我能搬回家去了
So I guess I can move back home.

448
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:47,170
他就不能早一分钟发这条信息吗
He couldn't have sent you that message one minute ago?

449
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,310
没关系的  歌洛莉亚
It's okay, Gloria.

450
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:50,390
我知道你的真实想法比较好
It's better that I know how you actually feel.

451
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,900
南瓜节的主席台上
Well, there seems to be a lot of hubbub

452
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,300
似乎有不小的骚动
on the dais at pump' fest.

453
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,440
他们为什么要聚集还在世的历任市长
Why are they gathering all the living mayors?

454
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,660
正式宣布
It's official.

455
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:03,360
达拉·宝华特女士打破了旧南瓜记录
Ms. Darla Bowater has shattered the old pumpkin record.

456
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,990
好吧
Okay.

457
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,890
我想你能理解  发生这些事
I'm sure you'll understand, under these circumstances,

458
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:09,150
我会快速收拾东西  泡个澡
I'll just quickly gather my things, take that bath,

459
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,950
然后...  走人
and... be on my way.

460
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:14,950
是哪位
Who is it?

461
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,640
联合快递特快邮件
Special delivery from UPS.

462
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,040
联合恶作剧快递
United Prank Service.

463
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,790
这个恶作剧我参考了历史书
I went to the history books for this one,

464
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,730
追溯到恶作剧鼻祖
all the way back to the first practical joke --

465
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:24,580
特洛伊木马
the Trojan Horse.

466
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,150
不过我用喷彩代替了大刀
Only I swapped out silly string for broad swords

467
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,890
用欢笑代替了谋杀
and laughter for murder.

468
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,110
好的
Okay.

469
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:32,900
你们喜欢恶作剧是吧
You guys want to prank?

470
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,230
那就来恶作剧
Let's prank.

471
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,430
不
Oh, no.

472
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,260
不
Oh, no!

473
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,170
不
No!

474
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,540
不
Nooooo!

475
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,140
不  老天爷啊
No! God!

476
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:57,470
他们不过是朝你院子里扔了点厕纸
They just put some toilet paper in your yard.

477
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,740
他为什么要这么对我们  妈妈
Why would he do this to us, Mother?

478
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,990
这是场意外
It was an accident!

479
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,770
毛毛哪去了  我找不到毛毛了
Where's Fluffy?! I can't find Fluffy!

480
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,950
别担心  我帮你找
Don't worry! I'll help you find her!

481
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,100
我的眼睛
My eye!

482
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,280
快进屋去  快进屋去
Go in the house! Go in the house!

483
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,230
我为什么觉得这么有活力
Oh, why do I feel so energized?

484
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:15,160
因为满足了建造这份原始男性本能
Because you honored your primal male instinct to build.

485
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:17,000
-是啊  -曾经贫瘠的荒原
- Yeah. ‭- Where once lay barren fields,

486
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,150
因为像我们这样的男人
because of men like us,

487
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,090
如今成了灯火辉煌的都市
now gleaming cities stand.

488
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,970
都市又是什么  不过是...
And what is a city, but --

489
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,740
装载人类文明的衣柜
A closet for civilization.

490
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:27,700
这是我这辈子最为你骄傲的一刻
This is the proudest damn moment of my life.

491
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,270
那让我想起了痛苦的回忆
That brings back painful memories.

492
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,800
好像拐到我们家那条街去了
Huh, seems to be turning down our street.

493
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,920
谁能想到啊
Well, what do you know?

494
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:42,440
中间这块水晶像放大镜一样聚光了
This crystal in the middle acted like a magnifying glass.

495
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,590
-普里契特先生  -嗯
- Mr. Pritchett... ‭- Yeah.

496
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,250
过去两个月内已经发生了两次
...this is the second time in two months.

497
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,660
很开心你这么喜欢我们
We love that you're a fan,

498
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,450
但或许你买本消防员日历就好了
but maybe you should just buy a calendar.

499
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,190
抱歉  米奇  我也很难过
I'm sorry, Mitch. I feel really bad.

500
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,870
你觉得能不能由你来告诉小卡
Do you think maybe you could tell Cam?

501
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,590
我已经不在这儿打工了
Oh, I don't work here anymore.

502
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,000
菲尔  亲爱的
Phil? Honey?

503
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,450
克莱尔
Claire.

504
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,520
没有瞒下去的道理了
There's no sense in hiding it.

505
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,620
我确实买了个巨型南瓜
I did buy a giant pumpkin.

506
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,380
我猜到了
I puzzled that one out.

507
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,440
你说得对
You're right.

508
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,660
我就是个痴迷万圣节的大孩子
I'm a Halloween-obsessed child-man.

509
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,830
你想好过一点吗
Do you want to feel better?

510
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,480
我把丧尸带去公司了  好吗
I took zombies to work, okay?

511
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,650
这馊主意死得好惨
And it died so hard.

512
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:20,030
真要命  被玛格丽特同情
Oh, my God, to be pitied by Margaret...

513
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,270
我想孩子们是对的
I guess the kids are right.

514
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,460
我们是时候有个成年人的样子了
It's time for us to start acting like adults.

515
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,620
我们可以办晚宴  看舞台剧  开个人退休帐户
We can have dinner parties, see plays, open IRAs.

516
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,620
{\an8}由政府提供税收支持
个人自愿参与的退休储蓄计划

517
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,870
我们有个人退休账户的吧
We have IRAs, right?

518
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,300
当头棒喝啊  克莱尔
Rude awakening, Claire.

519
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,440
你以为自己是有趣有爱的爸爸
You think you're the fun-loving dad,

520
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,640
给人带来快乐  让童真不死
putting smiles on faces, keeping childhood alive.

521
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,570
结果你只是一个坐在南瓜坦克里
Turns out you're just the weird guy

522
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,810
冲下人家车道的怪叔叔
barreling down a driveway in a pumpkin-tank.

523
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,810
菲尔  我命令你不许再说这种话
Phil, I command you to stop speaking like that.

524
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,840
请你让我沉浸在悲伤中一会行吗
Please let me have my feelings for one second.

525
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,950
不  快转过来  真的  画面很美
No, come on, turn around. Seriously. It's good.

526
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,790
神奇女侠吗
Wonder Woman?

527
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:51,700
正是  而且我为你做了计划
Yes! And I have plans for you!

528
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:54,060
谁管其他人怎么想啊
Who cares what anybody thinks?

529
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,020
孩子们吃屎吧  公司的人都吃屎吧
Screw the kids. Screw everybody at work.

530
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,000
万圣节等我们哪天想放弃了才放弃
We'll give up Halloween when we are good and ready.

531
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,820
你们扮的是谁
Who are you guys supposed to be?

532
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,630
你们爸妈也想成为的牛人
Who your parents wish they were.

533
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,370
和本分手进行得并不顺利
Ending things with Ben did not go well.

534
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:07,400
他一直在帮忙我起头
He kept giving me openings,

535
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,960
但我就是狠不下心说出口
and I just couldn't pull the trigger.

536
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,120
我干嘛一直吃这块不新鲜的面包啊
Why do I keep eating this stale bread?

537
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:11,990
你也会这样吗
Do you ever do that?

538
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,150
明知有样东西不好
Like, you know something's bad,

539
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,590
但你还是要个不停
but you just keep going in for more

540
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:16,270
因为这是你面前唯一的选择
'cause it's the only thing in front of you?

541
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,980
对了  有件事挺恶心的
Uh, hey, this is gonna sound really gross,

542
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,430
我手上贴了张止血贴
but I have a Band-Aid on my hand,

543
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,040
在手毛特别浓密的地方  我知道一定会很痛
it's on a super-hairy spot, and I know it's gonna sting.

544
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,750
你能不能帮我撕下来  拜托啦
Would you take it off for me, please?

545
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,480
撕快一点  如果我注定会痛
And do it fast. If I'm gonna be hurt,

546
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,070
那长痛不如短痛
I just want to get it over with.

547
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,850
我想分手
I want to break up.

548
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,270
可以点菜了吗
Ready to order?

549
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,470
你刚才有没有听见我说的话
Uh, did you not just hear what I said?

550
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:38,240
-没有  什么  -我想分手
- No. What? - I want to break up.

551
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,100
我想点玉米片  你呢
So, I'm thinking nachos. What about you?

552
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,860
-我的天  我在和你分手  -什么
- Oh, my God! I'm breaking up with you! - What?

553
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,010
很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

554
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:49,420
这段时间很开心  但现在都结束了
It's been really great, but now it's over.

555
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,180
求你不要一哭二闹
Please don't make a scene.

556
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,980
我很难过  但我理解
I mean, I'm sad, but I get it.

557
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,330
我们正处于人生不同的阶段
We're in different phases of our lives,

558
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:57,960
你现在住在离我一小时以外的地方
and you live an hour away from me now,

559
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,310
我上周末也和我前女友
and I made out with my ex

560
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,010
在衣橱大会上亲热了
last weekend at the closet convention,

561
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,480
所以我又有多忠贞呢
so how committed am I?

562
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,720
加上你和我妈咪之间的矛盾
Plus that tension between you and Muh-ma -- Oy.

563
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,370
你背着我偷吃了
You cheated on me?!

564
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,670
我们当时喝醉了  好吗
We were drunk, okay?

565
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:08,960
而且她很难过
And she was really upset

566
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,630
因为她得把孩子送去大学
'cause she had to drop her daughter off at college.

567
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,240
你个渣男
You suck!

568
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,250
我竟然浪费了那么多时间
To think I wasted so much time

569
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,090
在你这个爱哭粘人幼稚烂人身上
on such a weepy, clingy, Pez-eating snore!

570
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:21,000
真不敢相信我曾乖乖坐在那儿扮芭比
I can't believe I sat there and pretended to be a doll

571
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,080
让你梳我的头发
as you brushed my hair!

572
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,860
你几乎是我交过最差劲的男朋友了
You are almost the worst boyfriend I have ever had!

573
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,050
最尴尬的一天奖得主是艾丽克丝
Okay, Alex wins most embarrassing day.

574
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,190
先别急着颁奖
Not so fast.

575
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,850
瞧这俩傻子
Look at these two ding dongs.

576
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:38,940
那是爸妈在一个巨型南瓜里吗
Is that Mom and Dad in a giant "punkin"?

577
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,580
至少这次我们没被拉去
Well, at least we didn't get dragged into it this time.

578
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,700
谢天谢地
Thank God.

579
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,800
对  因为我们另有计划
Yep. Because we got stuff goin' on.

580
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,210
小卡
Cam...

581
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,270
我刚刚其实可以
I'm sure that there were better ways

582
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,650
表达得更好一些
for me to say what I said.

583
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,940
你在打包我的面霜
You're packing my face creams.

584
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,360
不用道歉
No need to apologize.

585
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:01,750
我知道我踩过界了
I know I crossed boundaries.

586
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,200
我从小的环境就这样
It's how I grew up.

587
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,680
所有人之间都没有秘密
Nobody had secrets from anybody.

588
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,690
高中派对时  "真心话大冒险"我们只玩大冒险
At high-school parties, we just played Dare.

589
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:07,610
我懂这种感觉
I know the feeling.

590
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,310
我也是在一个小镇上长大的
I grew up in a small town myself.

591
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,990
我们还不得不带陌生人到镇上
We had to bring in a stranger

592
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,670
好让孩子们学会不能和谁说话
so that the children could learn who not to talk to.

593
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,790
我必须说  你的家乡往事
You know, I have to say, sometimes your hometown stories 

594
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,850
有时听起来是编的
sound a little made-up.

595
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,100
我很抱歉我说了那些恶毒话
I am sorry that I was mean,

596
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:23,210
我也很抱歉你不再拥有最大的南瓜了
and I am sorry that you don't have the biggest pumpkin anymore.

597
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:26,230
其实这已经和保持记录无关了
It's not even about having the record anymore.

598
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:29,070
那记录是我让小镇生活留在心中的方式
I-It's just how I kept the small town alive in me.

599
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,840
-或许很蠢吧  -才不是
- Probably dumb. - ‭No.

600
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,840
离开自己热爱的地方  是很艰难的事
It's hard when you have to leave a place you love.

601
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,020
每一年  那地方好像都在渐渐消失
Every year, it feels like more of it fades away.

602
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,270
我会很难过  因为我知道
I get very sad because I know

603
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:43,260
我的口音几乎完全消失了
that my accent is almost completely gone.

604
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,760
总之  我该走了
Anyway, I-I should go.

605
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,540
等等  我有东西给你
Wait. I have something for you.

606
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,510
一颗南瓜籽
A pumpkin seed?

607
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:55,110
我想或许明年它也能打破记录
I think it can be next year's record-breaker.

608
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,370
天啊  歌洛莉亚
Oh, my... Gloria...

609
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,470
好了
Okay!

610
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,790
-好啦  好啦  -天啊
- All right, all right! - Oh, my gosh!

611
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:02,750
老天啊
Oh, my God!

612
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,470
我们乘着蔬菜浮在水面上了
We're floating in a vegetable!

613
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,950
乘着巨型蔬菜
In a giant vegetable!

614
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,290
当家人年纪渐长  你有两个选择
As families get older, you have two options --

615
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,900
你可以强迫大家在一起
you can force everyone together,

616
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,320
也可以接受传统会消失
or you can accept that traditions die

617
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,760
人会往前迈进
and people move on.

618
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:18,310
除非你刚好有个巨型南瓜
Unless you happen to have a giant pumpkin.

619
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,990
你们来这儿干什么呢
Hey! What are you guys doing here?

620
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:21,880
我们收到暗示了
We got the hint.

621
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,710
我们也来玩  你们才会开心
It wasn't gonna be fun unless we were here, too,

622
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,060
所以我们追踪了你们的手机
so we tracked your phones.

623
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,170
小卡说
Cam says the record

624
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:29,260
北美45米南瓜赛艇的记录是18秒
for the North American 50-yard pumpkin dash is 18 seconds.

625
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,420
-我们应该能做到  -我们肯定能做到
- I think we can do it! ‭- Oh, I know we can do it!

626
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,250
-给我们计时  -开划
- Time us! - ‭Let's do it!

627
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,250
-好的  -好咧
- Okay! - Okay!

628
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,560
你们能做到  打破18秒记录
You can do it! Beat that 18 seconds!

629
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,760
你们快到了
You're so close!

630
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,410
等等  划到那边去
Wait! There -- row it there!

631
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,770
我们成功了吗  花了18秒吗
Okay. Did we do it? Was that 18 seconds?

632
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:45,070
是5分钟
5 minutes.

633
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,320
好接近呀
Still close!

634
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,470
事情的始末是这样的
All right, here's what happened.

635
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,100
就在你刚发完短信说厨房弄好后
Right after you sent the text saying the kitchen was done,

636
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,380
检查员忽然上门突击检查
the inspector popped in for a little surprise visit.

637
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,120
现在厨房的装修不合规
Now, it's before violations.

638
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,370
我们得迟几周才能完工
Which pushes us back for a couple of weeks now.

639
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,640
说是我的错  我可以承受小卡的怒火
Blame me. I can take the heat from Cam.

640
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,120
但你们得去克莱尔家住
You stay with Claire.

641
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,710
-因为我承受不住歌洛莉亚的怒火  -好
- 'Cause I can't take the heat from Gloria. - Right.

642
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,290
你一个字都别说  都交给我
Not a word. I do all the talking.

643
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:09,740
因为你很不会说谎
Because you're a terrible liar.

644
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,210
你来了  今天怎么样
Hey, there you are. Good day?

645
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,100
你这是什么意思
What...what's that supposed to mean?

646
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,350
你只有心虚的时候才会嗯哼
You only say that when you're guilty.

647
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,330
你身上有烟的味道
You smell like smoke.

648
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,780
天啊  你又把厨房烧毁了吗
Oh my god. Did you burn the kitchen down again?

649
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,860
就好像你根本不希望我帮你一样
It's like you don't want me to help you.
