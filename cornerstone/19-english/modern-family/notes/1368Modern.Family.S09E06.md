|212|00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,720|来个司康饼吧 |Have a scone! |
|61|00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,150|好  我得在爸爸家跟你碰头 |Okay, good. I'll <b>have</b> to meet you at Dad's. |
|183|00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,830|我一戴上这玩意儿 就感觉好像我没有室友似的 |Oh! ‭I put that baby on, it's almost like I don't <b>have</b> roommates. |

|209|00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,160|赶紧进去  装着心里难受 告诉她你想喝下午茶 |Just go in there, act all heartsick, and tell her you want to <b>have</b> high tea. |
|293|00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,060|我得变个说法 说成我这么做是为你好就行了 |I just <b>have</b> to spin it as if it's something I did in your best interest. |
