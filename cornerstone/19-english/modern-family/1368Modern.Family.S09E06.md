|43|00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,500|我在婚宴上灌了她三杯|I fed her, like, three drinks at the reception.|
|44|00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,070|想缓和一下气氛嘛|You know, just to take the edge off.|
|48|00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,400|她差点就把门框都扯掉了|She almost took the doorframe off.|
|49|00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,960|她进入了虫洞|Into the wormhole she goes.|
|53|00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,800|美丽的新娘|The beautiful bride!|
|59|00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,110|米奇尔  你取蛋糕了吗|Mitchell, did you get the cake?|
|64|00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,470|别跟小卡提变魔术的事  对吧|not to mention the trick to Cam, right?|
|72|00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,290|那年是2007年|The year was 2007 --|
|73|00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,930|杰和歌洛莉亚的婚宴|the wedding reception of Jay and Gloria.|

|93|00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,100|这让我们的歌曲串烧更受欢迎了|Which makes our medley all the more welcome.|
|97|00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,950|好吧  我们就这么去派对吧|Fine. We'll just... go to the party.|
|112|00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:13,380|很遗憾  他今天不会出席派对|Unfortunately, he's gonna be a no-show at the party today.|

|126|00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,240|体验到大学生活了|by being here all the time.|
|128|00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,090|我一直到来年春天才再见到他|and I didn't see him again till the spring.|
|134|00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,990|对你没好处|to be here all the time.|
|135|00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,050|所以赶紧走吧|So hit the road,|
|141|00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,260|意思就是|in the sense that...|
|145|00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,100|表演这个魔术|at the party with Phil.|
|151|00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,420|唯一合理的解释就是|The only logical explanation|
|155|00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,240|所以过去这周|So for the past week,|

|177|00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,940|有无执照魔术师在场时|I can't disclose the secret|
|178|00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,350|我不能泄露表演秘密|in the presence of a non-licensed magician.|
|182|00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,800|五感剥夺头盔|The old sensory-deprivation helmet.|
|192|00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,260|推掉了伊斯塔帕游艇上的魔术演出|if you hadn't turned down the magician gig|
|199|00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,810|你忘开通风口了|Well, you forgot to turn on the ventilator.|
|234|00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,580|然后我就会求你让我参演  是吧|that I'd beg to be back in the act, didn't you?|
|239|00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,310|排练还没结束呢|The rehearsal's not over!|

|331|00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,620|就像那部我没写完的摇滚歌剧的主人公一样|Just like the hero of that rock opera I never finished.|
|332|00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,800|菲尔  我说了我没心情唠家常|Phil, this feels like the chitchatting.|

|454|00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,620|连我出席婚礼该穿什么|I couldn't even make an outfit choice for the wedding|
|456|00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,430|所以我当年才偷给了她三杯酒|That's why I slipped her those three drinks at the reception.|
|461|00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,030|是我让他别转告你留言的|I'm the one who told him not to give you the message.|

|465|00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:15,450|而孩子们都还小|and the kids were really little.|
|467|00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,540|原来我老婆才是我不能有魔术事业的凶手|My own wife is the reason I don't have a career in magic --|
|484|00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,750|我也以为曼尼来了就能让你负担一轻呢|Yeah, I thought for sure Manny being here would tip the scales.|
|492|00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,060|我大老远去曼尼宿舍只是白费功夫吗|I drove all the way to Manny's dorm for nothing?|
|493|00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,080|对对对  你今天牺牲最大了|Oh, because you've made the sacrifice today.|
|497|00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:37,200|但事实上我几乎没下过什么功夫|but the reality is that I barely do anything.|
|513|00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,170|过去十年是我人生最美好的一段日子|These have been the best 10 years of my life.|
|517|00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,520|走  上车|Let's go. Get in the car.|
|520|00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,040|没告诉你那份工作  我很抱歉|I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the job.|
