# Design a call center

* Constraints and assumptions
	* What levels of employees are in the call center?
	* Can we assume operators always get the initial calls?
	* If there is no available operators or the operator can't handle the call, does the call go to the supervisors?
	* If there is no available supervisors or the supervisor can't handle the call, does the call go to the directors?
	* Can we assume the directors can handle all calls?
	* What happens if nobody can answer the call?
	* Do we need to handle 'VIP' calls where we put someone to the front of the line?
	* Can we assume inputs are valid or do we have to validate them?
