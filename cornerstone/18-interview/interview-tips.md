# Interview Tips

## Be a co-worker 

Don’t be a candidate - be **a co-worker**.

During your next interview, position yourself more like a “co-worker” than a “candidate”. 

If you can make the interviewer, hiring manager, etc. feel that they already know what it would be like to work with you - you’ll put yourself far ahead of the rest of the “candidate” pack. 

A few tips to help make this happen:

- Bring them into the conversation by asking follow-up and clarifying questions (and incorporate their answers into your responses)

- Problem solve with them as you work through scenario based questions (make assumptions and state those assumptions, solicit feedback from them as you work through problems, and be open to, and make adjustments for their feedback)

- Choose/provide examples of past experiences that align with their business (tailor your responses to their industry and company so that they can personally and easily relate)

- Be human (you should always have a pool of examples/stories at the ready, but practice weaving them into the conversation instead giving robot-feeling, templated responses)


## People Like Us Do Things Like This

People Like Us - Do Things Like This

I recently read Seth Godin's new book "This Is Marketing" (and loved it).

One of the main lessons throughout the book can also be easily leveraged by a candidate during interviews. Here's how:

The Lesson: "People Like Us Do Things Like This"

What It Means: In short, "People Like Us Do Things Like This" is used to explain how someone's personal belief system drives their actions, and is the "definition of culture" according to Seth (ex: "I buy kombucha, because that's what health conscious people like me choose to drink").

3 Easy Ways to Leverage This Lesson as a Candidate: 

1. Research what "People Like Us" means to those that you are interviewing with (i.e. what are their values, interests, beliefs, etc.)

2. Tailor your answers/conversations around themes from your research findings (ex: if the company is passionate about "putting the client first", then use past examples of when you focused on the same value to help create the narrative "I am like you - we are similar").

3. Actively listen to your interviewer and ID themes for likes/dislikes from their responses (use these themes in your follow-ups, conversations, etc. to make them feel "oh, you're people like me", and subsequently that you are a "good" culture fit).
