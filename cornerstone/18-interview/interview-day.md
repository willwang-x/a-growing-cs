# How to be a better interviewee?

> Make the interviewer engaged!  面试就是一场能力表现赛，让面试官共鸣很重要！

## How to improve your performance 

- Define and confirm **signature** with the interviewer. This helps you clarify with the **interviewer** about required details
- Explain your idea before coding, make sure it makes sense to the interview
- Clarify the **meaning** of your variable, especially when you define:
	- **Entries** of DP array
	- Hashmap
- Coding while you are **talking**
- Be proactive to find your **bug** after finish your code
- Be proactive to propose test case 
- Try to be **comprehensive** to cover **corner case**, when proposing test cases
- Use table to go through test cases when possible. Explain how does states of each variable change, when going through the code.
- Be proactive to think and propose **optimization** of your current code

## Suggestions on Google Docs coding 

1. Close page break: View -> Print layout
2. Prevent from auto capitalization: Tools -> Preferences -> Automatically capitalize words 

## 经验 

* **保持精力**：面试当天，不要复习。保持**精力**，留给面试，保持平常心。
* **当场思考**：不要想有所依赖，**当场思考**，可能比想要依赖记忆来得更流畅。
* **自留余地**：**Think aloud**固然好，但是不利于自己思考说时，可以说“Could you give me one minute to think? I tell you my idea later”, 会更好。因为有时**思考需要安静**，告诉面试官你在做什么即可。首先是**做题**(完成)，其次是传达(完美)。
* **系统表达**：在表达想法时，一定要**分类讨论**，思路要全面，然后着重其中一点展开。系统化思考是软件工程师的基本素养，而这里你体现的地方。

## Interview flow 


### Before interview

- Go through [Do and Don't](https://github.com/yangshun/tech-interview-handbook/blob/master/preparing/cheatsheet.md)

### Before coding ...  

* First, let's write down some **test cases**💯 that helps us to understand the problem.
* --- 
* Can I assume that ...? 
	* clarify: input -> ouput 
	* I am going to run a test to see if what I understand is right.
* ---
* Can you give me a minute to think?
* ---
* The **first idea** I come up with ...
* The most intuitive way is to ...
* ---
* Let me think if there any way that we can save time or space?
* ---
* I am going to use **this test**💯 to explain my solution (by hand)
	* Time complexity (reason)
		* O(n)
		* n^2 square
		* n^3 cube
		* n-to-the-18th-power
	* Space complexity 
* Is it good enough to start to **code**?
* ---

### In coding ...  

* Coding while you are talking 💯
* Define and confirm signature with the interviewer. This helps you clarify with the interviewer about required details
* Clarify the meaning of your variable, especially when you define: 
	* Entries of DP array
	* Hashmap


### After coding ... 

* Be proactive to find your **bug** 💯 after finish your code
* Be proactive to propose **test case**
* Try to be comprehensive to **cover corner case**, when proposing test cases
* ---
* Use table to go through test cases when possible. Explain how does states of each variable change, when going through the code.
* ---
* Be proactive to think and propose **optimization** of your current code

**Questions** to ask:

* tech stack 
* product 
* typical week 
* engineering culture

### After interview

* Thank you letter 
* The **Code** that you haven't finished
