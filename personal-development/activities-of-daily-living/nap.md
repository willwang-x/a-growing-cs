### [How to Nap](https://www.wikihow.com/Nap)

Napping Effectively

1. **Nap in the early afternoon.** The best time for a nap is between **12pm and 3pm**, at which point your **melatonin** levels are highest and your **energy** level tends to be lowest. If you struggle with after-lunch drowsiness, grabbing a few minutes of nap can make you more productive and awake in the long-run, as opposed to gulping down an energy drink and trying to press on. 
	* Try to **avoid naps after 4pm**, especially if you struggle with **insomnia**. Sleeping too late in the day can make it harder to get to sleep at night, when you want to go to sleep.
* **Keep it short.** Grabbing **10-20 minutes** of rest is usually best for a **middle-of-the-day nap**. More than that can leave you feeling drowsier than when you started, meaning you'll have to go through the whole waking-up process for the second time in the day.
	* Alternatively, if you need a serious nap because you slept poorly the previous night, Try to aim for **a full REM cycle of 90 minutes**. Sleeping for 60 minutes can make you feel groggy for the rest of the day, whereas 90 minutes--a full sleep cycle--can leave you feeling refreshed.
* **Set an alarm.** The idea of nodding off for too long can keep some people from actually falling asleep. Take the stress off and set an alarm, even if it's only 15 minutes from now, to wake you back up and get you back to whatever you've got to do. You can rest easy knowing you're not going to wake up when it's dark outside.
* **Try a caffeine nap.** While it may sound **counterintuitive** to drink a cup of coffee right before you go to sleep, caffeine's got to travel all the way through your digestive tract before you feel that caffeinated jolt--a process that takes about 20 minutes--so some pro nappers swear by the caffeine nap, which times itself perfectly with your wake-up.

Creating a Sleep Environment

1. Try to make it dark.
1. Eliminate noise and distractions. 
1. Consider using white noise to block out distracting background noise.
1. Lie down in a comfortable position.
1. Stay warm.
1. Just close your eyes and breathe deeply.
1. Don't feel guilty.

Trying Alternatives

* Meditate.
* Go for a walk after lunch.
* Play a quick game.
* Avoid more eating and caffeine.

## What 

### Overview

A nap is a short period of sleep, typically taken during daytime hours as an adjunct to the usual nocturnal sleep period. Naps are most often taken as a response to drowsiness during waking hours. A nap is a form of biphasic or polyphasic sleep, where the latter terms also include longer periods of sleep in addition to one single period.

For years, scientists have been investigating the benefits of napping, including the 30-minute nap as well as sleep durations of 1â€“2 hours. Performance across a wide range of cognitive processes has been tested.
