## What 

### Overview

The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is an alphabetic system of phonetic notation based primarily on the Latin script. It was devised by the International Phonetic Association in the late 19th century as a standardized representation of speech sounds in written form.[1] The IPA is used by lexicographers, foreign language students and teachers, linguists, speech-language pathologists, singers, actors, constructed language creators and translators.[2][3]

The IPA is designed to represent those qualities of speech that are part of lexical (and to a limited extent prosodic) sounds in oral language: phones, phonemes, intonation and the separation of words and syllables.[1] To represent additional qualities of speech, such as tooth gnashing, lisping, and sounds made with a cleft lip and cleft palate, an extended set of symbols, the extensions to the International Phonetic Alphabet, may be used.[2]

IPA symbols are composed of one or more elements of two basic types, letters and diacritics. For example, the sound of the English letter ⟨t⟩ may be transcribed in IPA with a single letter, [t], or with a letter plus diacritics, [t̺ʰ], depending on how precise one wishes to be.[note 1] Slashes are used to signal phonemic transcription; thus /t/ is more abstract than either [t̺ʰ] or [t] and might refer to either, depending on the context and language.

Occasionally letters or diacritics are added, removed or modified by the International Phonetic Association. As of the most recent change in 2005,[4] there are 107 segmental letters, an indefinitely large number of suprasegmental letters, 44 diacritics (not counting composites) and four extra-lexical prosodic marks in the IPA. These are shown in the current IPA chart, also posted below in this article and at the website of the IPA.[5]

## FAQs

#### Q: keywords vs ?

A: 

#### Q: What advantages, if any, are there for learning the IPA when studying a language with phonetic spelling?

A: Learning IPA is useful if you want to learn the pronunciation of words from a dictionary.

However, IPA is less useful in the following cases (non-exhaustive list):

* You are using dictionaries that use an **alternative phonetic transcription system** (e.g. the Encarta World English Dictionary used a different system).
* You are learning a language with a very **straightforward relationship** between spelling and pronunciation (e.g. Finnish). In that case, IPA can be useful if you are not yet familiar with the pronunciation of the language, but you should be able to learn this quickly enough from listening to recordings, teachers, etc.
* You are learning Chinese. For Standard Chinese, the main transcription system is pinyin; see for example Where can I find Chinese IPA transcriptions? on Chinese StackExchange. In some cases, e.g. if you are learning Chinese in Taiwan, Zhuyin fuhao or bopomofo can be useful.

#### Q: IPA Tools & Resources?

A: 

* International Phonetic Alphabet chart: This Wikipedia page includes interactive charts to see and hear all of the standard IPA symbols, as well as a downloadable PDF of the revised 2018 chart.
* Handbook of the International Phonetic Association: This comprehensive guide introduces all IPA symbols, how they’re used in various world languages, the alphabet’s history, and much more.
* MIT’s IPA Converter & Learning Tool: Quiz yourself on IPA symbols or paste a word to see its IPA transcription.
* Fluent Forever: Gabriel Wyner’s awesome new app (the most funded app in crowdfunding history!) relies extensively on IPA and mouth diagrams to help you develop accurate, native-like pronunciation from the very beginning. In addition to the app, I also highly recommend his book Fluent Forever: How to Learn Any Language Fast and Never Forget It, as well as the companion pronunciation and ear training resources on his site. And don’t miss my interview with Gabe on The Language Mastery Show.
* Glossika: This site and web app leverages spaced repetition, native speaker audio, and an innovative “mass sentence method” to help you reach fluency faster. I especially like that all sentences are transcribed in both the target language and IPA. Check out my interview with Glossika founder Mike Campbell on The Language Mastery Show.
* YouTube: Search for your target language + “IPA” or “mouth positions” to see and hear proper pronunciation patterns.
* Wiktionary: Dubbed “The Free Dictionary,” this open source Wikimedia resource includes detailed definitions and IPA transcriptions for many world languages.
* Dictionary.com app: For those wanting to see the IPA transcription of English words, check out the app version of Dictionary.com, available for iOS and Android. The web version, unfortunately, only shows clunky “spelling style” transcriptions, not IPA.
* The IPA Alphabet: How and Why You Should Learn the International Phonetic Alphabet (With Charts): This detailed guest post on Fluent in 3 Months by George Millo Ayancan provides a detailed overview of the IPA, why it’s useful for aspiring polyglots, and how best to learn it.
* Lingthusiasm: In episode 6 of the Lingthusiasm podcast, hosts Lauren Gawne and Gretchen McCulloch talk about the history of the International Phonetic Alphabet, its inner workings, and even share some IPA games!
