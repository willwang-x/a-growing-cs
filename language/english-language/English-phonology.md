English phonology
  <br><br>
</h1>

> Like many other languages, English has wide variation in pronunciation, both historically and from dialect to dialect. In general, however, the regional dialects of English share a largely similar (but not identical) phonological system. Among other things, most dialects have vowel reduction in unstressed syllables and a complex set of phonological features that distinguish fortis and lenis consonants (stops, affricates, and fricatives).

## Why 

Phonology is about sounds considered to be structured for conveying linguistic meaning so in the context of speaking a language this is very important because a language is only understood if spoken phonologically correct.

**One could know thousands of vocabulary words but if they arenâ€™t pronounced correctly nobody will understand what is trying to be said.** Communication is based on speaking and receiving feedback through speaking. Without correct use of phonology communication is impossible.

## What 

### Overview 

Like many other languages, English has wide variation in pronunciation, both historically and from dialect to dialect. In general, however, the regional dialects of English share a largely similar (but not identical) phonological system. Among other things, most dialects have vowel reduction in unstressed syllables and a complex set of phonological features that distinguish fortis and lenis consonants (stops, affricates, and fricatives).

Phonological analysis of English often concentrates on or uses, as a reference point, one or more of the prestige or standard accents, such as Received Pronunciation for England, General American for the United States, and General Australian for Australia. Nevertheless, many other dialects of English are spoken, which have developed independently from these standardized accents, particularly regional dialects. Information about these standardized accents functions only as a limited guide to all of English phonology, which one can later expand upon once one becomes more familiar with some of the many other dialects of English that are spoken.

#### Q: Why Phonological Awareness Is Important for Reading and Spelling?

A: 

* Phoneme awareness is **necessary** for learning and using the alphabetic code
* Phoneme awareness **predicts** later outcomes in reading and spelling
* The majority of poor readers have relative difficulty with phoneme awareness and other phonological skills
* Instruction in phoneme awareness is **beneficial** for novice readers and spellers
* Phonological awareness interacts with and **facilitates** the development of vocabulary and word consciousness
