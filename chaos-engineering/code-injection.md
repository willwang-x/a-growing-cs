## Why



## What 

Code injection is the **exploitation** of a computer **bug** that is caused by processing invalid data. Injection is used by an attacker to introduce (or "inject") code into a vulnerable computer program and change the **course** of execution. The result of successful code injection can be disastrous, for example by allowing computer worms to propagate.
