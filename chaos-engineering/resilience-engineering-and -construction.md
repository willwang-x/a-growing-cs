# Resilience (engineering and construction) 

> the ability of buildings and infrastructure to absorb **assaults** without suffering complete failure. [[wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Resilience)]

## Why

A resilient structure/system/community is expected to be able to 

* resist to an extreme event with **minimal** damages and **functionality** disruptions during the event; 
* after the event, it should be able to rapidly recovery its functionality similar to or even **better** than the pre-event level.


## What 

In the fields of engineering and construction, resilience is the ability to absorb or avoid damage without suffering complete failure and is an objective of design, maintenance and restoration for buildings and infrastructure, as well as communities.
