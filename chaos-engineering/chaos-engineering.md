# Chaos engineering 

> Chaos engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a software system in production in order to build **confidence** in the system's capability to **withstand** turbulent and unexpected conditions. [[wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Chaos_engineering)]

## Why

In software development, a given software system's ability to tolerate failures while still ensuring adequate quality of service—often generalized as **resiliency**—is typically specified as a requirement. However, development teams often fail to meet this requirement due to factors such as **short deadlines or lack of knowledge** of the field. Chaos engineering is a technique to meet the **resilience** requirement.

Chaos engineering can be used to achieve resilience against:

* Infrastructure failures
* Network failures
* Application failures

## How 


## What

* History: Chaos engineering probably comes from [Netflix's migration to the cloud in 2011](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Chaos_engineering#/History).
