## What 

In computing, aspect-oriented software development (**AOSD**) is a software development methodology that seeks new **modularizations** of software systems in order to **isolate** secondary or supporting functions from the main program's business logic. AOSD allows multiple concerns to be expressed separately and automatically unified into working systems.
