## What 

### Overview

The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to Wikipedia:

Wikipedia – a free, web-based, collaborative and multilingual encyclopedia project supported by the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation. It has more than **48** million articles (over **6.2 million in English**) written collaboratively by volunteers around the world. Almost all of its articles can be edited by anyone with access to the site, and it has about **100,000** regularly active contributors.

### What type of thing is Wikipedia?

* **Reference work** – compendium of information, usually of a specific type, compiled in a book for ease of reference. That is, the information is intended to be quickly found when needed. Reference works are usually referred to for particular pieces of information, rather than read beginning to end. The writing style used in these works is informative; the authors avoid use of the first person, and emphasize facts.
* **Database** – organized collection of data. The data is typically organized to model aspects of reality in a way that supports processes requiring information. For example, modelling the availability of rooms in hotels in a way that supports finding a hotel with vacancies.
* **Website** – collection of related web pages containing images, videos or other digital assets. A website is hosted on at least one web server, accessible via a network such as the Internet or a private local area network through an Internet address known as a Uniform Resource Locator. All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web.
* **Community** – group of interacting people with social cohesion, who may share common values.
* **Collective memory** – shared pool of information held in the memories of two or more members of a group.
