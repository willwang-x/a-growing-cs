[Music](https://www.netflix.com/watch/80243768):

* A brief history of music, and a discussion on the [definitions](https://i.imgur.com/DrmOTK7.png) of music and rhythm. Featuring Tokimonsta.
* Explained examines several questions surrounding music in particular when does sound **become** music and why are humans **uniquely** able to master music. It talks to researchers who study the cognition of music and how music can help people learn to speak and move after **disabilities**. It looks at **beat**, **pitch**, **octave**, and rhythm. 
* **Music**: Before we hear it, all music is just air. Sound starts as air vibrations, which then move our eardrums and then little bones and then finally fluid in the cochlea, and that triggers hair cells to fire. It's really wonderfully [complicated](https://i.imgur.com/pXWJR2Q.png).
* **Rhythm**: a [repeating sound](https://i.imgur.com/skFyBDg.png) creates one of the most basic aspects of music: rhythm. Our reptilian brain, the brain stem and cerebellum, help us create the rhythmic patterns necessary to walk. That's widespread. But what's incredibly rare, is our ability to feel a beat... tempo, beats per minute. It is the most simple, most basic rhythm in our life. It is how our [heart beats](https://i.imgur.com/Xwx9wo4.png). Higher BPM songs that are faster tends to make us move faster, raises our heartbeat.
* **Pitch**:  If a sound repeats fast enough, we hear it as pitch. 
* If you place electrodes on these three spots on your head and listen to this... [rich-toned beat] the electrical signal from those electrodes would sound like [this](https://i.imgur.com/x5svUJv.png). [duller, tinnier beat]
* Playing multiple pitches at the same time unlocks another feature of music: **harmony**.
* **Octaves**: Octaves are pitches with [double or half the frequency](https://i.imgur.com/J8SOFr9.png) of another. That kind of sense of equivalence is very widespread in human culture. Every culture divides the space between octaves into [scales](https://i.imgur.com/J8SOFr9.png). Most of us remember melody by the [relative pitch](https://i.imgur.com/9159cG8.png), the [space](https://i.imgur.com/HCgxwCi.png) in between notes, like this melody starting on C.
* **timbre**: Then there's timbre, the quality of sound that distinguishes pitch. Most people perceive timbre like they perceive color. It's a thing you can name.
* **Movement**: And music connects to movement. We actually register a beat in our brain's [motor system](https://i.imgur.com/tZzBh6c.png). That's likely why it can help people with movement disorders.
* **Emotion**: But there is something magic about music's power over our mood. Major meaning happy and minor meaning sad is not universal. For a Western ear, it might sound pretty happy, but Balinese will associate that with ceremonial rites and particularly cremations. But meaning accumulating based on the scale system of your culture, that is universal.
