- **Bury Card / Note**: Hides a card or all of the note’s cards from review **until the next day**. This is useful if you cannot answer the card at the moment or you want to come back to it another time.
- **Suspend Card / Note**: Hides a card or all of the note’s cards from review **until they are manually unsuspended**.  This is useful if you want to avoid reviewing the note **for some time**, but don’t want to delete it.
