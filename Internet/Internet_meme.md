### Overview

An Internet meme, more commonly known simply as a meme (/miːm/ MEEM), is a **type of idea, behaviour, or style** (meme) that is spread via the Internet, often through social media platforms and especially for **humorous** purposes. Memes can spread from person to person via social networks, blogs, direct email, or news sources. They may relate to various existing Internet cultures or subcultures, often created or spread on various websites. Internet memes are " Often, modifications or spoofs add to the profile of the original idea thus turning it into a phenomenon that transgresses social and cultural boundaries".[1] One hallmark of Internet memes is the appropriation of a part of broader culture, for instance by giving words and phrases intentional misspellings (such as lolcats) or using incorrect grammar (such as doge). In particular, many memes utilize popular culture (especially in image macros of other media), although this can lead to issues with copyright.
