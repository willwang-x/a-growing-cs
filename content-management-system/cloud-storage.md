## Why 

The best camera is probably the one in your pocket. Smartphones rule the day, with ever-increasing features and megapixel ratings capable of shooting high-resolution, 4K videos and photos. The better the quality, the bigger the files, which means finding the right place to store your amateur photo collection.

Uploading your latest images and videos to cloud providers frees up space on your portable devices, allowing them to be easily accessed wherever you are and on all platforms. Itâ€™s also the perfect way to free up your hard drive from a lifetime of photos, as well as protect them from being lost due to hardware failure.

## What 

### Overview

Cloud storage is a **model** of computer data storage in which the digital data is stored in logical pools, said to be on "the cloud". 

The physical storage spans multiple servers (sometimes in multiple locations), and the physical environment is typically owned and managed by a hosting company. These cloud storage providers are responsible for keeping the data **available** and **accessible**, and the physical environment **protected** and **running**. People and organizations buy or lease storage capacity from the providers to store user, organization, or application data.

Cloud storage services may be accessed through a colocated cloud computing **service**, a web service application programming interface (**API**) or by applications that utilize the API, such as cloud desktop storage, a cloud storage gateway or Web-based content management systems.
