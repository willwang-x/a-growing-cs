## Why 

Computational problems are one of the **main objects** of study in theoretical computer science. The field of computational complexity theory attempts to determine the amount of resources (computational complexity) solving a given problem will require and explain why some problems are intractable or undecidable. Computational problems belong to complexity classes that define broadly the resources (e.g. time, space/memory, energy, circuit depth) it takes to compute (solve) them with various abstract machines (e.g. classical or quantum machines).

It is typical of many problems to represent both instances and solutions by binary strings, namely elements of {0, 1}* (see regular expressions for the notation used). For example, numbers can be represented as binary strings using binary encoding.

## How



## What 

### Overview

In theoretical computer science, a computational problem is a **problem** that a **computer** might be able to solve, or a **question** that a computer may be able to **answer**. For example, the problem of factoring

> "Given a positive integer n, find a nontrivial prime factor of n."

is a computational problem. A computational problem can be viewed as an infinite collection of **instances** together with a, possibly empty, set of solutions for every instance. For example, in the factoring problem, the instances are the integers n, and solutions are prime numbers p that describe nontrivial prime factors of n.

## FAQs

#### Q: problem vs question?

A: Problems and questions are not entirely **distinguishable** from each other, a question may be expressing a **problem**. A distinction that can be made is that a problem is **always** something that is **desirable to solve or answer**, but **questions** may be **rhetorical**.
