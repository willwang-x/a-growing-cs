Order of magnitude 
  <br><br>

> An order of magnitude is an **approximation** of the **logarithm** of a value relative to some contextually understood reference value, usually **ten**, interpreted as the base of the logarithm and the **representative** of values of magnitude one. [[wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Order_of_magnitude#)]

## Why 

Order of magnitude is a method for describing the **size** of measures in terms of powers of **ten**. An order of magnitude estimates the approximate value or size of something in base-ten units such as, “in the millions.” For example, our national debt is “in the ten-trillions” of dollars which means it can be anywhere from 10 trillion to 99 trillion. Order of magnitude is an especially important concept in science. It allows scientists to **express** a number in scientific notation and roughly **determine** how much larger or smaller one object is **compared** to another.

### [Why](https://foldingburritos.com/articles/2015/12/23/benefits-and-caveats-of-a-simple-estimation-process/) do we estimate?

The goal of estimating is to help us **plan**. By having some kind of notion of the effort that’s needed to build something, we can:

* Compare its cost (and usually also its value) to other things we’re considering doing (for **prioritization**);
* Have a rough idea of when it will be done (to help give some general guidance to the release planning **process**);

## What 

### Overview

An order of magnitude is an **approximation** of the **logarithm** of a value relative to some contextually understood reference value, usually **ten**, interpreted as the base of the logarithm and the **representative** of values of magnitude one. Logarithmic distributions are common in nature and considering the order of magnitude of values sampled from such a distribution can be more intuitive. When the reference value is ten, the order of magnitude can be understood as the number of digits in the base-10 representation of the value. Similarly, if the reference value is one of certain powers of two, the magnitude can be understood as the amount of computer memory needed to store the exact integer value.

Differences in order of magnitude can be measured on a base-10 logarithmic scale in “decades” (i.e., factors of ten).[1] Examples of numbers of different magnitudes can be found at Orders of magnitude (numbers).
