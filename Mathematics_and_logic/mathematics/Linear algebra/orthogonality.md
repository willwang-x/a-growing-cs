### Overview

In mathematics, orthogonality is the **generalization** of the notion of **perpendicularity** to the **linear algebra** of **bilinear forms**. Two elements u and v of a vector space with bilinear form B are orthogonal when B(u, v) = 0. Depending on the bilinear form, the vector space may contain nonzero self-orthogonal vectors. In the case of function spaces, families of orthogonal functions are used to form a basis.
