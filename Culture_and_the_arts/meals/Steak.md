### Sous Vide Steak

* Ribeye Steak Medium-rare: 130 F x 1h 

### To Finish on the Stovetop

Prep:

* Cast Iron or Stainless Steel Skillet
* vegetable oil
* butter
* aromatics: whole thyme and rosemary sprigs
* sliced shallots, or **crushed whole garlic cloves**.
*

Step 1: **Remove the Steak From the Bag**

Remove the steak from the bag and place it on a paper towel-lined plate. Pat is dry very carefully on both sides. If you did not season before bagging the steak, season it now generously with salt and pepper.


Step 2: **Preheat** a Cast Iron or Stainless Steel Skillet

Turn on your vents and open your windows. Place a heavy cast iron or stainless steel skillet with 1 tablespoon of vegetable, canola, or rice bran oil over the hottest burner you have and preheat the skillet until it starts to **smoke**.


Step 3: **Start Searing**

Gently lay the steak in the skillet using your fingers or a set of tongs. If desired, add a tablespoon of **butter**. Butter contains milk solids that will blacken and char, helping your steak achieve a dark crust much faster and adding a characteristic slightly bitter, charred flavor. I happen to like this flavor (and it’s typical of a steakhouse experience). For a cleaner-tasting sear, omit the butter at this stage.


Step 4: **Add Aromatics**

If desired, add aromatics like whole thyme and rosemary sprigs with the leaves still attached, sliced shallots, or **crushed whole garlic cloves**.


Step 5

Flip and Repeat

After 15 to 30 seconds, flip the steak so that the second side comes into contact with the pan. Repeat, flipping the steak every 15 to 30 seconds until it has developed a nice brown sear, about **a minute and a half total**. If you did not add butter in step 3, add butter to the skillet about 30 seconds before the steak is done for added richness.


Step 6

Get the Edges

Using tongs, pick up the steak and rotate it so that the edge is in direct contact with the skillet. Continue to cook, rotating the steak along this edge until all of the edges are browned, about **another 45 seconds total**.


Step 6

Serve

Transfer the steak to a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet. When ready to serve, reheat any fat and juices left in the pan until sizzling then pour them over the steak to re-crisp and moisten the surface (the steaks can be served immediately if you are ready, no need to rest a sous-vide steak). Serve steaks immediately with coarse sea salt such as Maldon on the side.

#### Q: What is Doneness?

[A](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Doneness): 

Doneness is a gauge of how thoroughly cooked a cut of meat is based on its colour, juiciness, and internal temperature when cooked. The gradations of cooking are most often used in reference to beef (especially steaks and roasts) but are also applicable to veal, pork, lamb, poultry, and seafood (but not fish).

#### Q: What is  USDA Prime & [Beef carcass classification](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Beef_carcass_classification)?

[A](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Beef_carcass_classification): Prime has the highest marbling content when compared to other grades, and is capable of fetching a premium at restaurants and supermarkets. As of June 2009, about 2.9% of carcasses grade as Prime.U.S. Prime beef is sold to hotels and upscale restaurants, and usually marketed as such.

极佳级，牛龄9个月到2.5岁，脂肪含量较高，有明显的油花（marbling、雪花纹、也叫大理石脂肪纹），口感非常好，适用于烧、烤、煎等各种烹饪方式。Prime 牛肉通常供应给高级餐厅和酒店，超市里不常见到。越是好的牛排，往往越不需要很多调料及胭脂，**盐和黑胡椒足矣**，而不那么好的牛排则可能需要腌制。
