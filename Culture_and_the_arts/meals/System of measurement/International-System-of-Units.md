## What 

### Overview

The International System of Units (SI, abbreviated from the French Système international (d'unités)) is **the modern form of the metric system**. It is the **only** system of measurement with an official status in **nearly every country** in the world. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement starting with seven base units, which are the second (the unit of time with the symbol s), metre (length, m), kilogram (mass, kg), ampere (electric current, A), kelvin (thermodynamic temperature, K), mole (amount of substance, mol), and candela (luminous intensity, cd). The system allows for an unlimited number of additional units, called derived units, which can always be represented as products of powers of the base units.[Note 1] Twenty-two derived units have been provided with special names and symbols.[Note 2] The seven base units and the 22 derived units with special names and symbols may be used in combination to express other derived units,[Note 3] which are adopted to facilitate measurement of diverse quantities. The SI system also provides twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying power-of-ten (i.e. decimal) multiples and sub-multiples of SI units. The SI is intended to be an evolving system; units and prefixes are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves.

## FAQs

#### Q: the English measurement system vs the international system of units?

A: 

* Most countries use the Metric System, which uses the measuring units such as **meters and grams** and adds prefixes like kilo, milli and centi to count **orders of magnitude**. 
* In the United States, we use the older **Imperial system**, where things are measured in **feet, inches and pounds**. May 4, 2020
