## What 

### Overview

Kaiseki (懐石) or kaiseki-ryōri (懐石料理) is a traditional multi-course Japanese dinner. The term also refers to the collection of skills and techniques that allow the preparation of such meals and is analogous to Western haute cuisine.[1]

There are two kinds of traditional Japanese meal styles called kaiseki or kaiseki-ryōri. The first, where kaiseki is written as "会席" and kaiseki-ryōri as "会席料理", refers to a set menu of select food served on an individual tray (to each member of a gathering).[2] The second, written as "懐石" and as "懐石料理", refers to the simple meal that the host of a chanoyu gathering serves to the guests before a ceremonial tea,[2] and is also known as cha-kaiseki (茶懐石).[3] The development of nouvelle cuisine was likely inspired by kaiseki principles.[4]

### Style

In the present day, kaiseki is a type of art form that balances the **taste**, **texture**, **appearance**, and **colors** of food.[7] To this end, only fresh seasonal ingredients are used and are prepared in ways that aim to enhance their flavor. Local ingredients are often included as well.[9] Finished dishes are carefully presented on plates that are chosen to enhance both the appearance and the seasonal theme of the meal. Dishes are beautifully arranged and garnished, often with real leaves and flowers, as well as edible garnishes designed to resemble natural plants and animals.


#### Order

Originally, kaiseki comprised a bowl of miso soup and three side dishes;[10] this is now instead the standard form of Japanese-style cuisine generally, referred to as a セット (setto, "set"). Kaiseki has since evolved to include an appetizer, sashimi, a simmered dish, a grilled dish and a steamed course,[10] in addition to other dishes at the discretion of the chef.[11]

* Sakizuke (先附): an appetizer similar to the French amuse-bouche.
* Hassun (八寸): the second course, which sets the seasonal theme. Typically one kind of sushi and several smaller side dishes.
* Mukōzuke (向付): a sliced dish of seasonal sashimi.
* Takiawase (煮合): vegetables served with meat, fish or tofu; the ingredients are simmered separately.
* Futamono (蓋物): a "lidded dish"; typically a soup.
* Yakimono (焼物): (1) flame-grilled food (esp. fish); (2) earthenware, pottery, china.
* Su-zakana (酢肴): a small dish used to cleanse the palate, such as vegetables in vinegar; vinegared appetizer.
