Due to their health aspect (cooking without any oil), food steamers are used extensively in health-oriented diets such as cuisine minceur, some raw food diets, the Okinawa diet, a macrobiotic diet, or the CRON-diet.[citation needed]

Food steamers release less heat to the kitchen environment, therefore helping keep the kitchen cool during hot summers.
