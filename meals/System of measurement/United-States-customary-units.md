In science, **medicine**, many sectors of **industry**, and some **government** and **military** areas, metric units are used. The International System of Units (SI), the modern form of the metric system, is preferred for many uses by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

## What 

### Overview

United States customary units (U.S. customary units) are a system of measurements **commonly** used in the United States since it was formalized in 1832. The United States customary system (USCS or USC) developed from English units which were in use in the **British Empire** before the U.S. became an independent country. The United Kingdom's system of measures was **overhauled** in 1824 to create the imperial system, changing the definitions of some of its units. Subsequently, while many U.S. units are essentially similar to their imperial counterparts, there are significant differences between the systems.
