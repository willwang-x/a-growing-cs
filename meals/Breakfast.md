## What 

### Overview

Breakfast is the **first meal** of the day eaten after waking up, usually in the morning.[1] The word in English refers to breaking the fasting period of the previous night.[2] There is a strong likelihood for one or more "typical", or "traditional", breakfast menus to exist in most places, but their composition varies widely from place to place, and has varied over time, so that globally a very wide range of preparations and ingredients are now associated with breakfast.

### Effect on health

While breakfast is commonly referred to as "the most important meal of the day",[5][6] some epidemiological research indicates that having breakfast high in rapidly available carbohydrates increases the risk of metabolic syndrome.[7] Present professional opinion is largely in favor of eating breakfast,[5] but some contest the positive implications of its "most important" status.[8] The influence of breakfast on managing body weight is unclear.[9][10]
