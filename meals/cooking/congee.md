## What 

### Overview

Congee or conjee (/ˈkɒndʒi/) is **a type of rice porridge or gruel**. The word 'congee' itself is a derivation of the Tamil word kañci or kanji.[1] When eaten as plain rice congee, it is most often served with side dishes. When additional ingredients such as meat, fish, and flavourings are added while preparing the congee, it is most often served as a meal on its own, especially for persons who are ill. Names for congee are as varied as the style of its preparation. Despite its many variations, it is usually a thick porridge of rice largely disintegrated after prolonged cooking in water.

## FAQs

#### Q: Porridge vs. Congee?

A: Rice porridge is simply rice cooked in liquid until it's thick and creamy. ... So, congee is a type of rice porridge, but not all rice porridge is congee—like the way all squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares.
