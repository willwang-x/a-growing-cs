## What 

The modules described in this chapter provide a variety of **specialized data types** such as dates and times, fixed-type arrays, heap queues, double-ended queues, and enumerations.

Python also provides some **built-in data types**, in particular, dict, list, set and frozenset, and tuple. The str class is used to hold Unicode strings, and the bytes and bytearray classes are used to hold binary data.
