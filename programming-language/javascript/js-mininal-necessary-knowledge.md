# Mininal Necessary Knowledge for JavaScript

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted or JIT-compiled programming language with **first-class functions**. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a **prototype-based**, **multi-paradigm**, **dynamic language**, supporting **object-oriented**, **imperative**, and **declarative** (e.g. functional programming) styles. 

## 1. What is First-class functions?

> First-Class functions treat functions as first-class citizens. Language supports passing functions as **arguments** to other functions, **returning** them from other functions, and **assigning** them to variables and storing them in **data structures**.

## 2. What is prototype-based? [ ]

> Prototype-based programming is a style of **object-oriented programming** in which classes are not explicitly defined, but rather derived by adding **properties** and **methods** to an instance of another class or, less frequently, adding them to **an empty object**.

> In simple words: this type of style allows the creation of an object **without first defining its class**.

## 3. What is standard objects and work flow in JS?

* **Standard objects**: Get to know standard built-in objects Array, Boolean, Date, Error, Function, JSON, Math, Number, Object, RegExp, String, Map, Set, WeakMap, WeakSet, and others.
* **Expressions and operators**: Learn more about the behavior of JavaScript's operators instanceof, typeof, new, this, the operator precedence, and more.
* **Statements and declarations**: Learn how do-while, for-in, for-of, try-catch, let, var, const, if-else, switch, and more JavaScript statements and keywords work.
* **Functions**: Learn how to work with JavaScript's functions to develop your applications.
