# Standard library for JavaScript

## Why 

Try to find [standard library](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Standard_library) for JavaScript. But

> One of the problems with JavaScript is that there is no standard library as there is in other languages. This means that we have to download everything we need and not just the "extras". [[i-programmer](i-programmer.info/news/167-javascript/12608-the-javascript-standard-library.html)]

## What 

* [stdlib](https://stdlib.io/): Standard library for JavaScript and Node.js.
