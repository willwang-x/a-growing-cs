# Java syntax

> The syntax of Java refers to the set of rules defining how a Java program is written and interpreted. [[wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Java_syntax)]

## Why

> The syntax is mostly derived from C and C++. Unlike in C++, in Java there are no **global functions or variables**, but there are data members which are also regarded as global variables. All code belongs to **classes** and all values are **objects**. The only exception is the **primitive types**, which are not represented by a class instance for **performance** reasons (though can be automatically converted to objects and vice versa via **autoboxing**). Some features like operator **overloading** or unsigned integer types are omitted to simplify the language and to avoid possible programming mistakes.
> 
> The Java syntax has been gradually extended in the course of numerous major JDK releases, and now supports capabilities such as generic programming and function literals (called lambda expressions in Java). Since **2017**, a new JDK version is released twice a year, with each release bringing incremental improvements to the language.
