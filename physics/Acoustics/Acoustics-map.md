Acoustics
  <br><br>
</h1>

> Acoustics is a branch of physics that deals with the **study** of **mechanical waves** in gases, liquids, and solids including topics such as **vibration**, **sound**, **ultrasound** and **infrasound**. [[wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Acoustics)]

## Why 

Knowledge in acoustics is essential to **promote the creation of environments**, both indoors and outdoors, involving rooms with good listening conditions for speakers, musicians and listeners and also living environments and working areas which are reasonably free from harmful and/or intruding noise and vibrations and with acoustic comfort. In other words; acoustics is a **discipline of great importance for a sustainable development**.
