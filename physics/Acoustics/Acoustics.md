Acoustics
  <br><br>

> Acoustics is a branch of physics that deals with the **study** of **mechanical waves** in gases, liquids, and solids including topics such as **vibration**, **sound**, **ultrasound** and **infrasound**. [[wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Acoustics)]

## Why 

Knowledge in acoustics is essential to **promote the creation of environments**, both indoors and outdoors, involving rooms with good listening conditions for speakers, musicians and listeners and also living environments and working areas which are reasonably free from harmful and/or intruding noise and vibrations and with acoustic comfort. In other words; acoustics is a **discipline of great importance for a sustainable development**.

## What 

### Overview

Acoustics is a branch of physics that deals with the **study** of **mechanical waves** in gases, liquids, and solids including topics such as **vibration**, **sound**, **ultrasound** and **infrasound**. A scientist who works in the field of acoustics is an acoustician while someone working in the field of acoustics technology may be called an **acoustical engineer**. The application of acoustics is present in almost all aspects of modern society with the most obvious being the audio and **noise control** industries.

**Hearing** is one of the most crucial means of survival in the animal world and **speech** is one of the most distinctive characteristics of human development and culture. Accordingly, the science of acoustics spreads across many facets of human societyâ€”music, medicine, architecture, industrial production, warfare and more. Likewise, animal species such as songbirds and frogs use sound and hearing as a key element of mating rituals or marking territories. Art, craft, science and technology have provoked one another to advance the whole, as in many other fields of knowledge. **Robert Bruce Lindsay**'s "Wheel of Acoustics" is a well accepted overview of the various fields in acoustics.
