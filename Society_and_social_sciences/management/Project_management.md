## Why 

1. **Defines a plan and organizes chaos** – projects are naturally chaotic. The main business function of the project management is the organization and planning of projects to cope with this chaos. A clear path from start to finish ensures that the outcome reaches the objectives of the project.
1. **Establish a chart and plan** – Without a chart, a project is more likely to cause delays and cost overruns. A clear graph is the key to a successful project.
1. **Encourages and encourages teamwork** – A project brings people together to team up, share ideas, and inspire. Collaboration is the cornerstone for effective project planning and management.
1. **Maximize resources** – Resources, financial or human, are expensive. By applying project management disciplines, such as project tracking and risk management, all resources are used efficiently and economically.
1. **Manage integration** – Projects do not happen in a vacuum. These must be integrated with business processes, systems and organizations. You can not build a sales system that does not integrate with your sales process and sales organizations. It would not add much value. Integration is often the key to the value of the project. Project management identifies and manages integration.
1. **Control costs** – Some projects may cost a significant amount of money so that budget performance is essential. Using project management strategies greatly reduces the risk of budget overruns.
1. **Manage Change** – Projects always happen in an environment where nothing is constant except for change. Managing change is a complex and daunting task. Not optional. Project management manages change.
1. **Quality Management** – Quality is the value you produce. Project management identifies, manages and controls quality. This results in a high quality product or service and a happy customer.
1. **Keep and Use Knowledge** – Projects generate knowledge or at least should. Knowledge is a significant asset for most businesses. Lack of knowledge management gains tends to fade quickly. Project management provides management and knowledge capture.
1. **Learning by mistake** – Some projects fail. When I do, it’s important to learn from this process. Project management provides learning lessons from the success and failure of the project.

## What 

### Overview

Project management is the process of leading the work of a **team** to achieve goals and meet success criteria at a specified time. The primary challenge of project management is to achieve all of the project goals within the given constraints.[1] This information is usually described in project documentation, created at the beginning of the development process. The primary constraints are scope, time, budget.[2] The secondary challenge is to optimize the allocation of necessary inputs and apply them to meet pre-defined objectives.

The objective of project management is to produce a complete project which complies with the client's objectives. In many cases the objective of project management is also to shape or reform the client's brief to feasibly address the client's objectives. Once the client's objectives are clearly established they should influence all decisions made by other people involved in the project – for example project managers, designers, contractors and sub-contractors. Ill-defined or too tightly prescribed project management objectives are detrimental to decision making.

A project is a temporary endeavor designed to produce a unique product, service, or result with a defined beginning and end (usually time-constrained, and often constrained by funding or staffing) undertaken to meet unique goals and objectives, typically to bring about beneficial change or added value.[3][4] The temporary nature of projects stands in contrast with business as usual (or operations),[5] which are repetitive, permanent, or semi-permanent functional activities to produce products or services. In practice, the management of such distinct production approaches requires the development of distinct technical skills and management strategies.[6]
