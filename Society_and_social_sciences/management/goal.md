> A goal is an **idea** of the future or **desired result** that a person or a group of people envision, plan and commit to **achieve**. [[wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Goal#/Goal_characteristics)]

## Why 

> A goal properly set is halfway reached. - Zig Ziglar

1. **Clearer Focus**: Properly thought out and stated, goals clearly set out your intentions and desires; the things you really want to achieve.
1. **Optimum Use of [Resources](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Resource)**: There are never enough resources to do everything so setting goals can help you to prioritise. Place your resources behind what you really want to do, rather than on things you are doing by default or by deflection.
1. **Effective Use of Time**: Of course time is a resource, but it deserves special consideration because it is so important. As Peter Drucker says: “If you want to improve how you manage time – stop doing what doesn’t need to be done!”
1. **Peace of Mind**: Too often you can have many things on your mind. Writing down your goals can help you take all of those ideas, apply perspective and priority, then galvanize you into commitment and action
1. **Clarity to [Decision Making](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Decision-making)**: Knowing what you are trying to do means that you can now ask: “does this activity get me closer to my goal?”
1. **Easier Measurement of What You Do**: Setting goals, especially SMART and SHARP goals, allows you to measure how well effectively you are moving towards achieving them
1. **More Freedom of Thought**: Setting goals can help to release your creative energies so you can focus on how to achieve them. You’ll start to look for ways to make it happen.
1. **Easier Communication with Others**: Setting goals enables you to clarify with other people what you are trying to do, and therefore what they need to do to contribute or support.

## What 

### Overview

A goal is an **idea** of the future or **desired result** that a person or a group of people envision, plan and commit to **achieve**. People endeavour to reach goals within a finite time by setting deadlines.

A goal is roughly similar to a purpose or aim, the anticipated result which guides reaction, or an end, which is an object, either a physical object or an abstract object, that has intrinsic value.

### Goal characteristics

Certain characteristics of a goal help define the goal and determine an individual's **motivation** to achieve that goal. The characteristics of a goal make it possible to determine what motivates people to achieve a goal, and, along with other personal characteristics, may predict goal achievement.

* **Importance** is determined by a goal's attractiveness, intensity, relevance, priority, and sign. Importance can range from high to low.
* **Difficulty** is determined by general estimates of probability of achieving the goal.
* **Specificity** is determined if the goal is qualitative and ranges from being vaguely to precisely stated.Typically, a higher-level goal is more vague than a lower level subgoal; for example, wanting to have a successful career is more vague than wanting to obtain a master's degree.
* **Temporal range** is determined by the range from proximal (immediate) to distal (delayed) and the duration of the goal.
* **Level of consciousness** refers to a person's cognitive awareness of a goal. Awareness is typically greater for proximal goals than distal goals.
* **Complexity** of a goal is determined by how many subgoals are necessary to achieve the goal and how one goal connects to another. For example, graduating college could be considered a complex goal because it has many subgoals, such as making good grades, and is connected to other goals, such as gaining meaningful employment.

### Goal setting

Goal-setting theory was formulated based on empirical research and has been called one of the most important theories in organizational psychology.[2] Edwin A. Locke and Gary P. Latham, the fathers of goal-setting theory, provided a comprehensive review of the core findings of the theory in 2002.[3] In summary, Locke and Latham found that specific, difficult goals lead to higher **performance** than either easy goals or instructions to "do your best", as long as **feedback** about progress is provided, the person is committed to the goal, and the person has the ability and knowledge to perform the task.[4]

According to Locke and Latham, goals affect performance in the following ways:[3]

1. goals direct attention and effort toward goal-relevant activities,
1. difficult goals lead to greater effort,
1. goals increase persistence, with difficult goals prolonging effort, and
1. goals indirectly lead to arousal, and to discovery and use of task-relevant knowledge and strategies.

A positive relationship between goals and performance depends on several factors. 

* First, the goal must be considered **important** and the individual must be **committed**. Participative goal setting can help increase performance, but participation itself does not directly improve performance.[3] 
* **Self-efficacy** also enhances goal commitment.[5] 
* For goals to be effective, people need **feedback** that details their progress in relation to their goal.[3] This feedback needs to be positive, immediate, graphic, and specific. Providing feedback leads to set references points and "comparisons to the standard inform their behavioral responses" (Stajkovic A.D. and Sergent, K, Cognitive Automation and Organizational Psychology).

Some coaches recommend establishing specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bounded (SMART) objectives, but not all researchers agree that these SMART criteria are necessary.[6] The SMART framework does not include goal difficulty as a criterion; in the goal-setting theory of Locke and Latham, it is recommended to choose goals within the 90th percentile of difficulty, based on the average prior performance of those that have performed the task.[7][3]

Goals can be long-term, intermediate, or short-term. The primary difference is the time required to achieve them.[8] Short-term goals expect to be finished in a relatively short period of time, long-term goals in a long period of time, and intermediate in a medium period of time.

#### Mindset theory of action phases

Before an individual can set out to achieve a goal, they must first decide on what their desired end-state will be. Peter Gollwitzer's mindset theory of action phases proposes that there are two phases in which an individual must go through if they wish to achieve a goal.[9] 

* For the first phase, the individual will mentally select their goal by specifying the criteria and deciding on which goal they will set based on their commitment to seeing it through. 
* The second phase is the planning phase, in which that individual will decide which set of behaviors are at their disposal and will allow them to best reach their desired end-state or goal.[10]:342–348

### Personal goals

Individuals can set personal goals. A student may set a goal of a high mark in an exam. An athlete might run five miles a day. A traveler might try to reach a destination-city within three hours. Financial goals are a common example, to save for retirement or to save for a purchase.

Managing goals can give returns in all areas of personal life. Knowing precisely what one wants to achieve makes clear what to concentrate and improve on, and often subconsciously prioritizes that goal. However, successful goal adjustment (goal disengagement and goal re-engagement capacities) is also a part of leading a healthy life.[11]

**Goal setting** and planning ("goal work") promotes long-term **vision**, intermediate **mission** and short-term **motivation**. It focuses intention, **desire**, acquisition of knowledge, and helps to organize resources.

Efficient goal work includes recognizing and resolving all **guilt**, inner conflict or limiting belief that might cause one to sabotage one's efforts. By setting clearly defined goals, one can subsequently measure and take pride in the accomplishment of those goals. One can see progress in what might have seemed a long, perhaps difficult, grind.

### Goal management in organizations

In organizations, goal management consists of the process of recognizing or inferring goals of individual team-members, abandoning goals that are no longer relevant, identifying and resolving conflicts among goals, and prioritizing goals consistently for optimal team-collaboration and effective operations.

For any successful commercial system, it means deriving profits by making the best quality of goods or the best quality of services available to end-users (customers) at the best possible cost.[citation needed] Goal management includes:

* assessment and dissolution of non-rational blocks to success
* time management
* frequent reconsideration (consistency checks)
* feasibility checks
* adjusting milestones and main-goal targets

Jens Rasmussen (human factors expert) and Morten Lind distinguish three fundamental categories of goals related to technological system management:[21]

* production goals
* safety goals
* economy goals

Organizational goal-management aims for individual employee goals and objectives to align with the vision and strategic goals of the entire organization. Goal-management provides organizations with a mechanism[which?] to effectively communicate corporate goals and strategic objectives to each person across the entire organization.[citation needed] The key consists of having it all emanate from a pivotal source and providing each person with a clear, consistent organizational-goal message so that every employee understands how their efforts contribute to an enterprise's success.[citation needed]

An example of goal types in business management:

* **Consumer goals**: this refers to supplying a product or service that the market/consumer wants[22]
* **Product goals**: this refers to supplying an outstanding value proposition compared to other products - perhaps due to factors such as quality, design, reliability and novelty[23]
* **Operational goals**: this refers to running the organization in such a way as to make the best use of management skills, technology and resources
* **Secondary goals**: this refers to goals which an organization does not regard as priorities[citation needed]

* Self-concordance model
* Goal displacement
