SMART criteria
  <br><br>
</h1>

> SMART is a mnemonic acronym, giving **criteria** to guide in the **setting of objectives**, for example in project management, employee-**performance management** and **personal development**. [[wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/SMART_criteria)]

## Why 

Setting goals can be **encouraging**, but can also be **overwhelming**. It can be hard to conceptualize every step you need to take to achieve a goal, which makes it easy to set goals that are too broad or too much of a stretch.

SMART goals, by contrast, allow you to set goals that are **clear**, **actionable**, and **effective**. When youâ€™re working with a team, SMART goals help you **align**, encourage you to define your objectives, and empower you to set deadlines. You can loop in new employees **without having to conduct extensive, time-consuming training**.

## What 

### Overview

SMART is a mnemonic acronym, giving **criteria** to guide in the **setting of objectives**, for example in project management, employee-**performance management** and **personal development**. The letters S and M generally mean specific and measurable. Possibly the most common version has the remaining letters referring to achievable (or attainable), relevant, and time-bound. However, the term's inventor had a slightly different version and the letters have meant different things to different authors, as described below. Additional letters have been added by some authors.

The first-known use of the term occurs in the November 1981 issue of Management Review by George T. Doran.[1] The principal advantage of SMART objectives is that they are easier to understand and to know when they have been done. SMART criteria are commonly associated with Peter Drucker's management by objectives concept.[2]

Often the term S.M.A.R.T. Goals and S.M.A.R.T. Objectives will surface. Although the acronym SMART generally stays the same, objectives and goals can differ. Goals are the distinct purpose that is to be anticipated from the assignment or project.[3] Objectives on the other hand are the determined steps that will direct full completion of the project goals.[3]
