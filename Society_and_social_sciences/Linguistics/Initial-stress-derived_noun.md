</h1>

## Why 

* To distinguish verb-adjective or verb-noun
* a [dead giveaway](https://www.languagetrainers.com/blog/2012/10/04/initial-stress-derived-nouns-and-why-theyre-important/) when telling a native English speaker and a very proficient non-native speaker apart. 
* initial-stress-derived nouns are something of a “secret handshake” for English speakers.
* Change the stress, change the meaning: [35 words that change meaning](https://www.engvid.com/english-resource/35-words-stress-changes-meaning/) e.g. content
	* The **CON-tent** of your essay is fine, but you need to rearrange the structure. (what it contains)

### Overview

Initial-stress derivation is a phonological process in English that moves stress to the first syllable of verbs when they are used as nouns or adjectives. (This is an example of a suprafix.) This process can be found in the case of several dozen verb-noun and verb-adjective pairs and is gradually becoming more standardized in some English dialects, but it is not present in all. The list of affected words differs from area to area, and often depends on whether a word is used metaphorically or not. At least 170 verb-noun or verb-adjective pairs exist. Some examples are:

record.

* as a verb, "Remember to rec**ó**rd the show!".
* as a noun, "I'll keep a r**é**cord of that request."

permit.

* as a verb, "I won't permít that."
* as a noun, "We already have a pérmit."
