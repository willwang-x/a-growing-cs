## Why 

Teaching morphemes unlocks the **structures** and **meanings** within words. It is very useful to have a strong awareness of prefixes, suffixes and base words. These are often spelt the same across different words, even when the sound changes, and often have a consistent purpose and/or meaning.

## What 

### Overview

A morpheme is the **smallest meaningful unit** in a language. A morpheme is **not necessarily** the same as a word. The main difference between a morpheme and a word is that a morpheme sometimes **does not stand alone**, but a word, by definition, always stands alone. The linguistics field of study dedicated to morphemes is called **morphology**.

### Examples

* "Unbreakable" is composed of **three** morphemes: **un-** (a bound morpheme signifying "not"), **-break-** (the root, a free morpheme), and **-able** (a free morpheme signifying "can be done").
* Allomorphs of the plural morpheme for regular nouns: /s/ (e.g., in cats /kæts/), /ɪz, əz/ (e.g., in dishes /dɪʃɪz/), and /z/ (e.g., in dogs /dɒɡz/).

### Classification

Every morpheme can be classified as either **free** or **bound**.[2] Since the categories are mutually **exclusive**, a given morpheme will belong to exactly one of them.

* **Free morpheme**s can function independently as words (e.g. town, dog) and can appear within **lexemes** (e.g. town hall, doghouse).
* **Bound morphemes** appear only as parts of words, always in conjunction with a root and sometimes with other bound morphemes. **For example**, **un-** appears only accompanied by other morphemes to form a word. Most bound morphemes in English are affixes, particularly **prefixes** and **suffixes**. Examples of suffixes are -tion, -sion, -tive, -ation, -ible, and -ing. Bound morphemes that are not affixed are called **cranberry morphemes**.
	* Derivational morphemes
	* Inflectional morphemes

### Allomorphs

Allomorphs are **variants** of a morpheme that differ in **pronunciation** but are **semantically identical**. For example, the English plural marker -(e)s of regular nouns can be pronounced /-s/ (bats), /-z/, (bugs), or /-ɪz, -əz/, (buses), depending on the **final sound** of the noun's plural form.

### Zero-Morpheme

A zero-morpheme, is a type of morpheme that carries semantic meaning but is not represented by auditory phonemes. They are often represented by /Ø/ within glosses.

Generally, these types of morphemes have no visible changes. For instance, sheep is both the singular and the plural form. The intended meaning is thus derived from the Co-occurrence determiner (in this case, "some-" or "a-").

### Content vs. function

Content morphemes express a **concrete meaning or content**, and function morphemes have more of a **grammatical** role. For example, the morphemes fast and sad can be considered content morphemes. On the other hand, the suffix `-ed` is a function morpheme since it has the grammatical function of indicating past tense.

* Content morphemes include free morphemes that are nouns, adverbs, adjectives, and verbs, and include bound morphemes that are bound roots and derivational affixes.
* Function morphemes may be free morphemes that are prepositions, pronouns, determiners, and conjunctions. Sometimes, they are bound morphemes that are inflectional affixes.
