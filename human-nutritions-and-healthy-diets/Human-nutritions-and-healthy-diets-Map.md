> A healthy diet provides the body with essential nutrition: fluid, macronutrients, micronutrients, and adequate calories. [[wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Healthy_diet)]

## Why 

A healthy diet is essential for good health and nutrition. It protects you against many chronic noncommunicable diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Eating a variety of foods and consuming less salt, sugars and saturated and industrially-produced trans-fats, are essential for healthy diet.
