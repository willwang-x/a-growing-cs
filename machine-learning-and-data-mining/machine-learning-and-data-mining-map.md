>  Machine learning is a subfield of soft computing within computer science that evolved from the study of **pattern recognition** and **computational learning theory** in artificial intelligence. [[wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Outline_of_machine_learning)]
> 
> * **Machine learning** (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve **automatically** through **experience**.
> * **Data mining** is a process of discovering **patterns** in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of **machine learning**, **statistics**, and **database systems**.
