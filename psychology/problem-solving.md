## Why 

Problem solving is at the core of human evolution. It is the methods we use to understand what is happening in our environment, identify things we want to change and then figure out the things that need to be done to create the desired outcome. Problem solving is the source of all new inventions, social and cultural evolution, and the basis for market based economies. It is the basis for continuous improvement, communication and learning.

## What 

### Overview

Problem solving consists of using **generic** or **ad hoc** methods in an orderly manner to find solutions to problems. Some of the problem-solving techniques developed and used in philosophy, artificial intelligence, computer science, engineering, mathematics, or medicine are related to mental problem-solving techniques studied in psychology.

### Problem-solving **strategies**

Problem-solving strategies are the steps that one would use to find the problems that are in the way to getting to one's own goal. Some refer to this as the "problem-solving cycle".[26]

In this cycle one will acknowledge, recognize the problem, define the problem, develop a strategy to fix the problem, organize the knowledge of the problem cycle, figure out the resources at the user's disposal, monitor one's progress, and evaluate the solution for accuracy. The reason it is called a cycle is that once one is completed with a problem another will usually pop up.

Insight is the sudden solution to a long-vexing problem, a sudden recognition of a new idea, or a sudden understanding of a complex situation, an Aha! moment. Solutions found through insight are often more accurate than those found through step-by-step analysis. To solve more problems at a faster rate, insight is necessary for selecting productive moves at different stages of the problem-solving cycle. This problem-solving strategy pertains specifically to problems referred to as insight problem. Unlike Newell and Simon's formal definition of move problems, there has not been a generally agreed upon definition of an insight problem (Ash, Jee, and Wiley, 2012;[27] Chronicle, MacGregor, and Ormerod, 2004;[28] Chu and MacGregor, 2011).[29]

Blanchard-Fields[30] looks at problem solving from one of two facets. The first looking at those problems that only have one solution (like mathematical problems, or fact-based questions) which are grounded in psychometric intelligence. The other is socioemotional in nature and have answers that change constantly (like what's your favorite color or what you should get someone for Christmas).

The following techniques are usually called problem-solving strategies[31]

* **Abstraction**: solving the problem in a model of the system before applying it to the real system
* **Analogy**: using a solution that solves an analogous problem
* **Brainstorming**: (especially among groups of people) suggesting a large number of solutions or ideas and combining and developing them until an optimum solution is found
* **Critical thinking**
* **Divide and conquer**: breaking down a large, complex problem into smaller, solvable problems
* **Hypothesis testing**: assuming a possible explanation to the problem and trying to prove (or, in some contexts, disprove) the assumption
* **Lateral thinking**: approaching solutions indirectly and creatively
* **Means-ends analysis**: choosing an action at each step to move closer to the goal
* **Method of focal objects**: synthesizing seemingly non-matching characteristics of different objects into something new
* **Morphological analysis**: assessing the output and interactions of an entire system
* **Proof**: try to prove that the problem cannot be solved. The point where the proof fails will be the starting point for solving it
* **Reduction**: transforming the problem into another problem for which solutions exist
* **Research**: employing existing ideas or adapting existing solutions to similar problems
* **Root cause analysis**: identifying the cause of a problem
* **Trial-and-error**: testing possible solutions until the right one is found

## FAQs

#### Q: solution vs approach?

A: 

* A solution is applicable only for problems where **the right answer** exists, such as "the solution of a linear equation."
* On the other hand, I think an approach is more applicable to **scenarios where it is unclear** whether it is **possible** to reach an **optimal** definitive answer. May 14, 2020
