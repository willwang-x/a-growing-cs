## Why 

The thing about sweating is that it's a full-body experience. When we're active, our bodies release **endorphins** and other “happy neurotransmitters,” including dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin in the brain. These neurotransmitters are associated with several positive functions and responses in both body and mind.

## What 

### Overview

Perspiration, also known as sweating, is the production of fluids secreted by the **sweat glands** in the **skin** of **mammals**.[1]

Two types of **sweat glands** can be found in humans: **eccrine glands** and **apocrine glands**.[2] The eccrine sweat glands are distributed over much of the body and are responsible for secreting the watery, brackish sweat most often triggered by excessive body temperature. The apocrine sweat glands are restricted to the armpits and a few other areas of the body and produce an odorless, oily, opaque secretion which then gains its characteristic odor from bacterial decomposition.

In humans, sweating is primarily a means of thermoregulation, which is achieved by the water-rich secretion of the eccrine glands. Maximum sweat rates of an adult can be up to 2–4 liters per hour or 10–14 liters per day (10–15 g/min·m2), but is less in children prior to puberty.[3][4][5] Evaporation of sweat from the skin surface has a cooling effect due to evaporative cooling. Hence, in hot weather, or when the individual's muscles heat up due to exertion, more sweat is produced. Animals with few sweat glands, such as dogs, accomplish similar temperature regulation results by panting, which evaporates water from the moist lining of the oral cavity and pharynx.

Although sweating is found in a wide variety of mammals,[6][7] relatively few (exceptions include humans and horses) produce large amounts of sweat in order to cool down.[8][9]
