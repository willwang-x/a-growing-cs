## 学习问题

- [Why do we want to learn something when we don't have time?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18476626) : When you're busy, perhaps you're bored with whatever you're busy with, and so your brain wants to do something creative.
Conversely, when you have free time, are you filling your free time with stimulus that take away the boredom? (e.g. browsing the web, video games, substances) If so, that's why the creativity and desire to learn are then disappearing.
When you have free time, try not allowing yourself to succumb to stimulus, and allow yourself to be bored. Then see if the desire to be creative returns.
