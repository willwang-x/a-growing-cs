## Why

I am learning about Angular2 recently. There is concept called decorators that is borrowed from Python. So I want to figure it out first before moving on.

There are more reason to use decorators:

1. Analytics, logging, and instrumentation
2. Validation and runtime checks
3. Creating frameworks
4. Reusing impossible-to-reuse code
5. Boosting your career

## What?

> In object-oriented programming, the **decorator pattern** is a design pattern that allows **behavior** to be **added** to an **individual** object, **dynamically**, **without** affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. [[wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Decorator_pattern)]
