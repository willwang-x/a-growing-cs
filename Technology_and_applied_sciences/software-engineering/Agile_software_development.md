## What 

### Overview

In software development, agile (sometimes written Agile)[1] practices involve discovering requirements and developing solutions through the collaborative effort of **self-organizing** and **cross-functional** teams and their customer(s)/end user(s).[2] It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continual improvement, and it encourages flexible responses to change.[3][4][further explanation needed]

It was popularized by the Manifesto for Agile Software Development.[5] The values and principles espoused in this manifesto were derived from and underpin a broad range of software development frameworks, including Scrum and Kanban.[6][7]

While there is much anecdotal evidence that adopting agile practices and values improves the agility of software professionals, teams and organizations, the empirical evidence is mixed and hard to find.[8][9]
