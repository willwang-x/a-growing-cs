Service-oriented architecture

> Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a style of software design where **services** are **provided** to the **other** **components** by application components, through a communication **protocol** over a network. [[wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Service-oriented_architecture)]

## Why 

Some enterprise architects believe that SOA can help businesses respond more **quickly and more cost-effectively** to changing **market conditions**.

* This style of architecture promotes **reuse** at the **macro** (service) level rather than micro (classes) level. 
* It can also **simplify** **interconnection** to—and usage of—existing IT (legacy) assets.

## What 

Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a style of **software design** where **services** are **provided** to the other **components** **by** application **components**, through a communication **protocol** over a network. A SOA service is a discrete unit of **functionality** that can be **accessed** remotely and acted upon and **updated** **independently**, such as retrieving a credit card statement online. SOA is also intended to be independent of vendors, products and technologies.

A service has four **properties** according to one of many definitions of SOA:

* It logically represents a business **activity** with a specified outcome.
* It is **self-contained**.
* It is a **black box** for its consumers, meaning the consumer does not have to be aware of the service's inner workings.
* It may consist of other underlying **services**.

Different services can be used in conjunction to provide the functionality of a large software application, a principle SOA shares with modular programming. Service-oriented architecture integrates distributed, separately maintained and deployed software components. It is enabled by technologies and standards that facilitate components' communication and cooperation over a network, especially over an IP network.

SOA is related to the idea of an application programming interface (API), an interface or communication protocol between different parts of a computer program intended to simplify the implementation and maintenance of software. An **API** can be thought of as the **service**, and the **SOA** the architecture that **allows** the service to **operate**.
