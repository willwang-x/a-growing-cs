> Parallel computing is a type of computation where many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously. [[wiki]()]

## Why

Parallelism has long been employed in high-performance computing, but has gained broader interest due to the **physical constraints** preventing frequency scaling. As power **consumption** (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years, parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture, mainly in the form of **multi-core processors**.

## What 

Parallel computing is a type of **computation** where many **calculations** or the execution of processes are carried out **simultaneously**. Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time. There are several different forms of parallel computing: 

* bit-level, 
* instruction-level, 
* data, and 
* task parallelism.
