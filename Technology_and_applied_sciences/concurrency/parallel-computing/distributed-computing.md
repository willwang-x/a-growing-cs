## Why 

> Building distributed systems is hard. It's expensive. It's complex. But we do it anyway.

## What 

Distributed computing is a field of computer science that studies distributed systems. A distributed system is a **system** whose components are located on **different** networked computers, which **communicate** and **coordinate** their actions by passing messages to one another. The components interact with one another in order to achieve a **common** goal. Three significant **characteristics** of distributed systems are: 

* concurrency of components, 
* lack of a global clock, and 
* independent failure of components.

Examples of distributed systems vary from SOA-based systems to massively multiplayer online games to peer-to-peer applications.
