## What 

### Overview

In computing, a solution stack or software stack is a set of **software** subsystems or components needed to create a complete **platform** such that no additional software is needed to support applications.[1] Applications are said to "run on" or "run on top of" the resulting platform.

For example, to develop a **web application** the architect defines the stack as the target **operating system**, **web server**, **database**, and **programming language**. Another version of a software stack is operating system, **middleware**, database, and applications.[2] Regularly, the components of a software stack are developed by different developers independently from one another.

Some components/subsystems of an overall system are chosen together often enough that the particular set is referred to by a name representing the whole, rather than by naming the parts. Typically, the name is an acronym representing the individual components.[3]

The term "solution stack" has, historically, occasionally included hardware components as part of a final product, mixing both the hardware and software in layers of support.[4][5]

A **full-stack developer** is expected to be able to work in all the layers of the stack.


### Examples

* OpenBSD (operating system)
* C (programming language)
* httpd (web server)
* SQLite (database)
