## Why 

In building applications, an API (application programming interface) simplifies programming by **abstracting** the underlying implementation and only exposing objects or **actions** the developer needs. 

While a graphical interface for an email client might provide a user with a button that performs all the steps for fetching and highlighting new emails, an API for file input/output might give the developer a function that copies a file from one location to another without requiring that the developer understand the file system operations occurring behind the scenes.


## What 


An **application programming interface** (API) is a computing **interface** which defines **interactions** between multiple software intermediaries. It defines 

* the kinds of **calls or requests** that can be made, 
* how to **make** them, 
* the **data formats** that should be used, 
* the **conventions** to follow, etc. 

It can also provide extension **mechanisms** so that users can extend existing functionality in various ways and to varying degrees. An API can be entirely **custom**, specific to a component, or it can be designed based on an industry-standard to ensure **interoperability**. Through information hiding, APIs enable **modular programming**, which allows users to use the interface independently of the implementation.
