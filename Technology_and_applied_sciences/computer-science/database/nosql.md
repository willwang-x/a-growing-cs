# NoSQL Database 

![Maps](http://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/data_management-nosql.png)

> NoSQL databases are geared toward managing **large** sets of **varied** and **frequently updated** data, often in **distributed** systems or **cloud**. They avoid the **rigid** shemas associated with **relational** databases. 
> 
> But the architectures themselves vary and sepprated into four primary classifications, althought types are blending over time. 

## Why

Cloud application requirements have **pushed beyond the limitations** of relational database management systems.

And NoSQL has come to the rescue.

## What

A NoSQL (originally referring to "non-SQL" or "non-relational") database provides a **mechanism** for **storage** and **retrieval** of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in **relational** databases.

* **Document** databases: e.g. MongoDB
* **Graph** databases: e.g. Neo4j
* **Key-value** databases: e.g. Redis
* **Wide column** stores: e.g. HBase
