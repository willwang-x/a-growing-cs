# Gremlin 

## Background
![Why Graph databases](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/neo4j-buzzwords-100611065734-phpapp02/95/neo4j-5-cool-graph-examples-25-728.jpg?cb=1276239528)

## What 

> Gremlin is a graph traversal machine and **language** developed by Apache TinkerPop of the Apache Software Foundation.

> As an explanatory analogy, Apache TinkerPop and **Gremlin** are to graph databases what the JDBC and **SQL** are to relational databases. Likewise, the Gremlin traversal machine is to graph computing as what the Java virtual machine is to general purpose computing. 

## Why 
> What if you're Eddie Murphy and you're in a movie as multiple characters? We haven't even covered tracking directors, producers, assistants. How can we easily query for all people involved in a single movie if that data is spread across many tables? I don't have enough room in the slide to draw out the nightmare that this will turn into.
