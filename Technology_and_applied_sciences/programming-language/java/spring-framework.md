# Spring Framework

![Spring Framework Ecosystem](https://i.imgur.com/508EVFO.jpg)

> The Spring Framework is an application framework and **inversion of control container** for the Java platform. The framework's core features can be used by any Java application, but there are extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform. [[wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Spring_Framework)]

## Why 

> “We use a lot of the tools that come with the Spring framework and reap the benefits of having a lot of the out of the box solutions, and not having to worry about writing **a ton of additional code**—so that really saves us some time and energy.”

Spring makes programming Java quicker, easier, and safer for everybody. Spring’s focus on **speed**, **simplicity**, and **productivity** has made it the world's most popular Java framework.

Spring Framework is one topic of Spring

## What 

The **Spring Framework** includes several modules that provide a range of services:

* **Spring Core Container**: this is the base module of Spring and provides spring containers (BeanFactory and ApplicationContext).
* Aspect-oriented programming: enables implementing cross-cutting concerns.
* **Authentication and authorization**: configurable security processes that support a range of standards, protocols, tools and practices via the Spring Security sub-project (formerly Acegi Security System for Spring).
* **Convention over configuration**: a rapid application development solution for Spring-based enterprise applications is offered in the Spring Roo module
* **Data access**: working with relational database management systems on the Java platform using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) and object-relational mapping tools and with NoSQL databases
* **Inversion of control container**: configuration of application components and lifecycle management of Java objects, done mainly via dependency injection
* **Messaging**: configurative registration of message listener objects for transparent message-consumption from message queues via Java Message Service (JMS), improvement of message sending over standard JMS APIs
* **Model–view–controller**: an HTTP- and servlet-based framework providing hooks for extension and customization for web applications and RESTful (representational state transfer) Web services.
* **Remote access framework**: configurative remote procedure call (RPC)-style marshalling of Java objects over networks supporting Java remote method invocation (RMI), CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) and HTTP-based protocols including Web services (SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol))
* **Transaction management**: unifies several transaction management APIs and coordinates transactions for Java objects
* **Remote management**: configurative exposure and management of Java objects for local or remote configuration via Java Management Extensions (JMX)
* **Testing**: support classes for writing unit tests and integration tests
