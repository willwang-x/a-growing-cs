## What 

The following sections describe the standard types that are built into the interpreter.

The **principal** built-in types are numerics, sequences, mappings, classes, instances and exceptions.

Some collection classes are **mutable**. The methods that add, subtract, or rearrange their members in place, and don’t return a specific item, never return the collection instance itself but None.

Some operations are supported by **several object types**; in particular, practically all objects can be **compared** for equality, **tested** for truth value, and **converted** to a string (with the repr() function or the slightly different str() function). The latter function is implicitly used when an object is written by the print() function.
