> My personal study notes about programming languages

## Why 

What if the programming language is a knife, [what would it be](https://www.pixelstech.net/article/1334983942-If-programming-language-is-a-knife-what-would-it-be)?

> Just shown above.

Nowadays, the mobile phone is like a new organ of the human body. As an analogy, programming languages should be like **software craftsman's arms** that you can use very flexibly.

As per the [TIOBE index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/), the programming languages above are basically the 6 most popular languages.

We don't have to be a [Hyperpolyglot](http://hyperpolyglot.org/), BUT the best way to understand your [mother tongue](http://carlcheo.com/startcoding) is to learn a second language, e.g. [programming paradigms](https://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/VanRoyChapter.pdf), even if you don't use them since [languages shape the way we think](https://thorstenball.com/blog/2019/04/09/learn-more-programming-languages/).

The best way to learn a new language is to use it, e.g. re-build some [projects](https://hellogithub.com/).

## What 

For each programming languages, this repository should have:

1. **MAKE**: minimum actionable knowledge and experience, e.g. 101 or cheatsheet
1. **Must-read**: e.g. best practice or map or handbook
1. **Advanced**: e.g. philosophy behind it or design or practice projects
1. **Interview-Q&A**: like a metric to check your understanding


## How 

1. Finish the **MAKE** part when in need
1. Keep the **map** in mind and learn anything new we are faced with
1. Create a new **note** and learn by **Anki**
