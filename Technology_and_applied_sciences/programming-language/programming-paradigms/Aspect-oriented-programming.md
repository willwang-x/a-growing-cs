## What 

In computing, aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that aims to **increase modularity** by allowing the **separation** of **cross-cutting concerns**. 

It does so by adding **additional** behavior to **existing** code (an advice) **without** **modifying** the code itself, instead separately specifying which code is modified via a "**pointcut**" specification, such as "log all function calls when the function's name begins with 'set'". This allows behaviors that are **not central to** the business logic (such as **logging**) to be added to a program without **cluttering** the code, core to the functionality. AOP forms a basis for aspect-oriented software development.
