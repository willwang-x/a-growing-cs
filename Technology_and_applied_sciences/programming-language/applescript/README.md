# Applescript 

> Scripting allows you to automate complex, repetitive, and time-consuming tasks by writing scripts that interact with apps, processes, and the operating system. A script consists of **a series of statements**, each of which performs a specific operation. These statements work together to automate tasks. Through scripting, you can **create powerful workflow** solutions that **enhance productivity**, reduce errors, **save time**, and save money.

In OS X 10.10, **JavaScript** became a peer to **AppleScript** in OS X. There are many third-party websites and books that document the JavaScript language.
