## Why?

> “If you don’t know how compilers work, then you don’t know how computers work. If you’re not 100% sure whether you know how compilers work, then you don’t know how they work.” — Steve Yegge

## What?

A compiler is a translator which **transforms source language (high-level language) into object language (machine language)**. 

In contrast with a compiler, an interpreter is a program which **imitates the execution of programs** written in a source language. 

Another difference between Compiler and interpreter is that Compiler converts **the whole program** in one go on the other hand Interpreter converts the program by **taking a single line** at a time.
