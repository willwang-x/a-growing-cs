### Overview

In computer science, an expression is a **syntactic** entity in a programming language that may be **evaluated** to determine its **value**. It is a combination of one or more **constants**, **variables**, **functions**, and **operators** that the programming language interprets (according to its particular rules of precedence and of association) and computes to produce ("to return", in a stateful environment) another value. This process, for mathematical expressions, is called **evaluation**.

In simple settings, the resulting value is usually one of various primitive types, such as numerical, string, boolean, complex data type or other types.

Expression is often contrasted with statement - a syntactic entity, which has no value (an instruction.)

### Examples

For example, `2 + 3` is both an arithmetic and programming **expression**, which evaluates to 5. A variable is an expression because it denotes a value in memory, so y + 6 is also an expression. An example of a **relational expression** is 4 â‰  4, which evaluates to false.
