# Callback

> In computer programming, a callback, also known as a "call-after" function, is any executable code that is passed as an argument to other code; that other code is expected to call back (execute) the argument at a given time. [[wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Callback_(computer_programming))]

## Why 

Callback functions allow us to do something with data **at a later time**, allowing the rest of our code to run, instead of waiting for it. The **asynchronous** code allows us this **luxury** of executing anything later.

## What 

In computer programming, a callback, also known as a "call-after" function, is any executable **code** that is passed as an argument to other code; that other code is expected to call back (execute) the argument at a given time. This execution may be **immediate** as in a synchronous callback, or it might happen at **a later time** as in an asynchronous callback. Programming languages support callbacks in different ways, often implementing them with **subroutines**, **lambda expressions**, **blocks**, or **function pointers**.
