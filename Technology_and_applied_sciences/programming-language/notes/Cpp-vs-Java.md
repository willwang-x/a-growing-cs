# Java vs C++



Differences Between C++ vs Java


C++ and Java both are **object-oriented programming languages**, still, both C++ and Java languages are different from each other in many ways. To begin with, C++ vs Java have different design goals. C++ was implemented for **application and system development and is an extension of C language**. Along with the features of the procedural language, C++ has an added support for object-oriented programming features, exception handling, generic programming etc. C++ also has a standard library with many generic containers and algorithms.

Java was developed earlier with the functionality of an interpreter for printing systems which later supported network computing. It is built upon **the virtual machine** which is highly secure and portable in nature. It is grouped with a comprehensive library implemented to provide support for abstraction of the existing platform. Just like C++, Java is also **statistically** typed object-oriented programming language with a similar with an incompatible syntax. The main purpose of developing Java was to develop **an easy to use and widely available programming language**. Java has an extensive documentation as well which is known as Javadoc.

C++ uses pointers while Java does not involve pointers. Java uses the concept of ‘restricted pointers’. A C++ program is run and the compilation is done using its compiler. The compiler in C++ converts source code into machine level language which makes C++ a platform-dependent language. In Java, java source code is first converted into **bytecode** at the time of compilation. This bytecode is then interpreted by the interpreter and runtime to produce the output that makes Java a platform independent language.

C++ does not provide built-in support for threads whereas Java support threads **implicitly**. Though in the latest implementation of C++11, it does have support for threads as well. Java is much like C++ but does not involve complex concepts like **structures, operator overloading, pointers, templates, unions etc**. Also, Java doesn’t have support for conditional compile (#ifdef/#ifdef type).

Every entity is an **object** in java except fundamental types. Java has a single root hierarchy as everything emerged from java.lang.Object.



|#| vs | C++ | Java |
| :-- | :--- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | Memory Management | Managed by developers using pointers. Supports strutures and unions. | Controlled by system, does not use pointers. Supports Treaads and Interfaces. |
| 2 | Inheritance | Provide single and multiple inheritance both. | Does not support multiple inheritance. Uses the concept if interface to achiveve. |
| 3 | Runtime error detection mechanism | Programmer's responsiblity. | System's responsibility. |
| 4 | Libraries | Comparatively available with low-level functionalities. | Provide wide range of class for various high-level services. |
| 5 | Program Handling | Methods and data can reside outside classes. Concept of global file, namespace scopes available. | All methods and data reside in **class** itself. Concept od Package is used. |
| 6 | Type Semantics | Supports consitent support between primitive and object types. | Different for primitive and object types. |
| 7 | Portability | Platform depedent as source code must be **recompiled** for different platform. | Uses concepts of **bytecode** which is platform independent and can be used with platform specific JVM. |
| 8 | Polymorphism | **Explicit** for methods, supports mixed hierarchies. | **Automactic**, uses static and dynamic binding. |
