## What 

### base

In mathematics and computer science, a higher-order function is a function that does at least one of the following:

* takes one or more functions as arguments (i.e. procedural parameters),
* returns a function as its result.

All other functions are first-order functions. In mathematics higher-order functions are also termed operators or functionals. The differential operator in calculus is a common example, since it maps a function to its derivative, also a function. Higher-order functions should not be confused with other uses of the word "functor" throughout mathematics, see Functor (disambiguation).

### examples

* **map** function, found in many functional programming languages, is one example of a higher-order function. It takes as arguments a function f and a collection of elements, and as the result, returns a new collection with f applied to each element from the collection.
* **Sorting** functions, which take a comparison function as a parameter, allowing the programmer to separate the sorting algorithm from the comparisons of the items being sorted. The C standard function qsort is an example of this.
* filter
* fold
* apply
* Function composition
* Integration
* Callback
* Tree traversal
* Montague grammar, a semantic theory of natural language, uses higher-order functions
