> JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the **ECMAScript** specification. JavaScript is high-level, often **just-in-time** compiled, and **multi-paradigm**. It has **curly-bracket** syntax, **dynamic typing**, **prototype-based** object-orientation, and **first-class** functions. [[wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/JavaScript)]
