# call stack 

> Understand how a line of high-level code like JavaScript turns into and gets executed as a stack frame on the call stack (from high level languages to machine code).

## What?

> Call stack is a data structure which **records** the function calls, basically where in the program we are. If we call a function to execute , we push something on to the stack, and when we return from a function, we pop off the top of the stack.


Most recently invoked function is on the top of the stack.
The bottom of the stack is the first function invoked.
The stack is processed from top to bottom.
