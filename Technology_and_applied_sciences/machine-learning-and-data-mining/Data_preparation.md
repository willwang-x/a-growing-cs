Data preparation

> Data preparation is the act of manipulating (or pre-processing) **raw data** (which may come from disparate data sources) into a form that can readily and accurately be analysed, e.g. for business purposes. [[wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Data_preparation)]

## Why 

> There is a saying that is widely circulated in the industry: data and characteristics determine the upper limit of machine learning, and models and algorithms just approach this upper limit.

76% of data scientists say that data preparation is the worst part of their job, but the efficient, accurate business decisions can only be made with clean data. Data preparation helps:

* **Fix errors quickly** — Data preparation helps catch errors before processing. After data has been removed from its original source, these errors become more difficult to understand and correct.
* **Produce top-quality data** — Cleaning and reformatting datasets ensures that all data used in analysis will be high quality.
* **Make better business decisions** — Higher quality data that can be processed and analyzed more quickly and efficiently leads to more timely, efficient and high-quality business decisions.

Additionally, as data and data processes move to the cloud, data preparation moves with it for even greater benefits, such as:

* **Superior scalability** — Cloud data preparation can grow at the pace of the business. Enterprise don’t have to worry about the underlying infrastructure or try to anticipate their evolutions.
* **Future proof** — Cloud data preparation upgrades automatically so that new capabilities or problem fixes can be turned on as soon as they are released. This allows organizations to stay ahead of the innovation curve without delays and added costs.
* **Accelerated data usage and collaboration** — Doing data prep in the cloud means it is always on, doesn’t require any technical installation, and lets teams collaborate on the work for faster results.

## What 

### Overview

Data preparation is the act of manipulating (or pre-processing) **raw data** (which may come from disparate data sources) into a form that can readily and accurately be analysed, e.g. for business purposes.[1]

Data preparation is the first step in data analytics projects and can include many discrete tasks such as loading data or data ingestion, **data fusion**, **data cleaning**, **data augmentation**, and data delivery.[2]

The issues to be dealt with fall into two main categories:

systematic errors involving large numbers of data records, probably because they have come from different sources;
individual errors affecting small numbers of data records, probably due to errors in the original data entry.
