## What 

### Overview

A typeface is **the design of lettering** that can include **variations**, such as extra bold, bold, regular, light, italic, condensed, extended, etc. Each of these variations of the typeface is a **font**.

There are **thousands of different typefaces** in existence, with new ones being developed constantly.

The art and craft of designing typefaces is called **type design**. Designers of typefaces are called type designers and are often employed by type foundries. In digital typography, type designers are sometimes also called font developers or font designers.

Every typeface is a collection of **glyphs**, each of which represents an individual letter, number, punctuation mark, or other symbol. The same glyph may be used for **characters** from different scripts, e.g. Roman uppercase A looks the same as Cyrillic uppercase А and Greek uppercase alpha. There are typefaces tailored for special applications, such as map-making or astrology and mathematics.

The term typeface is frequently confused with the term font. Before the advent of digital typography and desktop publishing, the two terms had more clearly understood meanings.
