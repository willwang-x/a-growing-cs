## What 

### Overview

Metadata is "data that **provides information** about other data".[1] In other words, it is "data about data". Many distinct types of metadata exist, including **descriptive metadata**, **structural metadata**, **administrative metadata**,[2] **reference metadata** and **statistical metadata**.[3]

* **Descriptive metadata** is descriptive information about a resource. It is used for discovery and identification. It includes elements such as title, abstract, author, and keywords.
* **Structural metadata** is metadata about containers of data and indicates how compound objects are put together, for example, how pages are ordered to form chapters. It describes the types, versions, relationships and other characteristics of digital materials.[4]
* **Administrative metadata** is information to help manage a resource, like resource type, permissions, and when and how it was created.[5]
* **Reference metadata** is information about the contents and quality of statistical data.
* **Statistical metadata**, also called process data, may describe processes that collect, process, or produce statistical data.[6]

#### Q: How Metadata Pays Off?

[A](https://www.villanovau.com/resources/bi/metadata-importance-in-data-driven-world/#:~:text=Metadata%20is%20essential%20for%20maintaining,and%20over%20the%20longer%20term.): Investing in metadata development can create benefits in three key areas:

* It can extend **data longevity**. The life-span of a typical data set can be very short, often because missing or unavailable relevant metadata renders it useless. When comprehensive metadata is developed and maintained, it counters typical data entropy and degradation.
* It also **facilitates data reuse and sharing**. Metadata is key to ensuring that data which is highly detailed or complicated is more easily interpreted, analyzed and processed by the dataâ€™s originator and others.
* **Metadata is essential for maintaining historical records** of long-term data sets, making up for inconsistencies that can occur in documenting data, personnel and methods. Comprehensive metadata can also enable data sets designed for a single purpose to be reused for other purposes and over the longer term.
