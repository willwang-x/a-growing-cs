## Why 

* Prioritizing Requirements – Everybody does it but often too late.
* Prioritization helps you manage your requirements and your resources.
* Prioritization also helps manage the unknown unknowns. 
* With prioritization, you improve communication because you’re taking the guesswork out of the project.
* With prioritization, people tend to rethink their requirements.
* Prioritization is also helpful when releasing software in phases.

## How

### Cost-value approach

A good and relatively easy to use method for prioritizing software product requirements is the **cost-value approach**. This approach was created by Joachim Karlsson and Kevin Ryan. The approach was then further developed and commercialized in the company Focal Point (that was acquired by Telelogic in 2005). Their basic idea was to determine for each individual candidate requirement what the cost of implementing the requirement would be and how much value the requirement has.

## What 

### Overview

Requirement prioritization is used in Software product management for determining which candidate **requirements** of a software product should be included in a certain release. Requirements are also prioritized to minimize risk during development so that the most important or high risk requirements are implemented first. Several methods for assessing a prioritization of software requirements exist.[1][2]
