## What 

### Overview

A goal is an **idea** of the future or **desired result** that a person or a group of people envision, plan and commit to **achieve**. People endeavour to reach goals within a finite time by setting deadlines.

A goal is roughly similar to a purpose or aim, the anticipated result which guides reaction, or an end, which is an object, either a physical object or an abstract object, that has intrinsic value.

### Goal characteristics

Certain characteristics of a goal help define the goal and determine an individual's **motivation** to achieve that goal. The characteristics of a goal make it possible to determine what motivates people to achieve a goal, and, along with other personal characteristics, may predict goal achievement.

* **Importance** is determined by a goal's attractiveness, intensity, relevance, priority, and sign. Importance can range from high to low.
* **Difficulty** is determined by general estimates of probability of achieving the goal.
* **Specificity** is determined if the goal is qualitative and ranges from being vaguely to precisely stated.Typically, a higher-level goal is more vague than a lower level subgoal; for example, wanting to have a successful career is more vague than wanting to obtain a master's degree.
* **Temporal range** is determined by the range from proximal (immediate) to distal (delayed) and the duration of the goal.
* **Level of consciousness** refers to a person's cognitive awareness of a goal. Awareness is typically greater for proximal goals than distal goals.
* **Complexity** of a goal is determined by how many subgoals are necessary to achieve the goal and how one goal connects to another. For example, graduating college could be considered a complex goal because it has many subgoals, such as making good grades, and is connected to other goals, such as gaining meaningful employment.
