> Mathematics (from Greek: μάθημα, máthēma, 'knowledge, study, learning') includes the study of such topics as **quantity** (number theory),[1] **structure** (algebra),[2] **space** (geometry),[1] and **change** (mathematical analysis). It has no generally accepted definition. [[wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Mathematics#/overview)]

## Why 

If a 'religion' is defined to be a system of ideas that contains unprovable statements, then Gödel taught us that mathematics is not only a religion, it is the only religion that can prove itself to be one.  - John D. Barrow, The Artful Universe (1995).
