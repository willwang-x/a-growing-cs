> Mathematical optimization (alternatively spelled optimisation) or mathematical programming is the **selection** of a best element (with regard to some criterion) from **some set of available alternatives**. [[wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Mathematical_optimization#/overview)]

## Why 

Optimization problems of sorts arise in all quantitative disciplines from computer science and engineering to operations research and economics, and the development of solution methods has been of interest in mathematics for centuries.
