Narrative Map
  <br><br>
</h1>

> A narrative, story or tale is any account of a series of related events or experiences,[1] whether **nonfictional** (memoir, biography, news report, documentary, travelogue, etc.) or **fictional** (fairy tale, fable, legend, thriller, novel, etc.). [[wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Narrative#)]

## Why 

> Do not tell people how to live their lives. Just tell them stories. And they will figure out how those stories apply to them. - [Randy Pausch](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Story), in The Last Lecture (2008)
