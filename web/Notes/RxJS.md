## What?
> RxJS is a javascript library that brings the concept of "reactive programming" to the web.

> Reactive programming is just a different way of building software applications. Essentially, your software is built to **"react" to changes that happen** (like click events, data being fetched, etc) instead of **the typical way of writing software where we explicitly write code** (aka "imperative" programming) to handle those changes.

## Why?
> RxJS is to Javascript as Henry Ford's assembly line was to cars.
