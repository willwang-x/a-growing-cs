## 3. Why do we use Bootstrap?

Bootstrap provides pre-built styling(CSS) and functionality(JavaScript), making site-buildiong faster and easier.

Before Bootstrap, various libraries were used for interface development, which led to inconsistencies and a high maintenance burden.

According to Twitter developer Mark Otto:

> "A super small group of developers and I got together to design and build a new internal tool and saw an opportunity to do something more. Through that process, we saw ourselves build something much more **substantial** than another internal tool. Months later, we ended up with an early version of Bootstrap as a way **to document and share common design patterns** and assets within the company."
