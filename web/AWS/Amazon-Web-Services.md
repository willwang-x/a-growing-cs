## Why 

* Most **functionality**: AWS has significantly more services, and more features within those services, than any other cloud provider–from infrastructure technologies like compute, storage, and databases–to emerging technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, data lakes and analytics, and Internet of Things. 
* Largest community of customers and partners
* Most secure
* Fastest pace of innovation
* Most proven operational expertise


## What 

### Overview

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a subsidiary of **Amazon** providing **on-demand cloud computing platforms** and **APIs** to individuals, companies, and governments, on a **metered pay-as-you-go** basis. These cloud computing web services provide a variety of basic abstract technical infrastructure and **distributed computing** building blocks and tools. One of these services is **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud** (EC2), which allows users to have at their disposal a **virtual cluster of computers**, available all the time, through the Internet. AWS's version of virtual computers emulates most of the attributes of a real computer, including hardware **central processing units** (CPUs) and **graphics processing units** (GPUs) for processing; local/**RAM** memory; hard-disk/**SSD storage**; a choice of operating systems; networking; and pre-loaded application software such as **web servers**, **databases**, and **customer relationship management** (CRM).

The AWS technology is implemented at **server farms** throughout the world, and maintained by the Amazon subsidiary. Fees are based on a combination of usage (known as a "Pay-as-you-go" model), hardware, operating system, software, or networking features chosen by the subscriber required **availability**, **redundancy**, **security**, and service options. Subscribers can pay for a single virtual AWS computer, a dedicated physical computer, or clusters of either. As part of the subscription agreement, Amazon provides security for subscribers' systems. AWS operates from many global geographical regions including 6 in North America.

Amazon markets AWS to subscribers as a way of obtaining large scale computing capacity more quickly and cheaply than building an actual physical server farm. All services are billed based on usage, but each service measures usage in varying ways. As of 2017, AWS owns a dominant 33% of all cloud (**IaaS**, **PaaS**) while the next two competitors Microsoft and Google have 18%, 9% respectively according to Synergy Group.

### Services

As of 2020, AWS comprises more than 175[11] products and services including **computing**, **storage**, **networking**, **database**, **analytics**, **application services**, **deployment**, **management**, **mobile**, **developer tools**, and tools for the **Internet of Things**. The most popular include **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud** (EC2), **Amazon Simple Storage Service** (Amazon S3), and **AWS Lambda** (a **serverless function** enabling serverless **ETL** e.g. between instances of EC2 & S3).

Most services are not exposed directly to end users, but instead offer functionality through APIs for developers to use in their applications. Amazon Web Services' offerings are accessed over **HTTP**, using the **REST** architectural style and **SOAP** protocol for older APIs and exclusively **JSON** for newer ones.
