## Why 

* Most **functionality**: AWS has significantly more services, and more features within those services, than any other cloud provider–from infrastructure technologies like compute, storage, and databases–to emerging technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, data lakes and analytics, and Internet of Things. 
* **Largest community of customers and partners**: AWS has the largest and most dynamic community, with millions of active customers and tens of thousands of partners globally. Customers across virtually every industry and of every size, including startups, enterprises, and public sector organizations, are running every imaginable use case on AWS. The AWS Partner Network (APN) includes thousands of systems integrators who specialize in AWS services and tens of thousands of independent software vendors (ISVs) who adapt their technology to work on AWS. 
* **Most secure**: AWS is architected to be the most flexible and secure cloud computing environment available today. Our core infrastructure is built to satisfy the security requirements for the military, global banks, and other high-sensitivity organizations. This is backed by a deep set of cloud security tools, with 230 security, compliance, and governance services and features. AWS supports 90 security standards and compliance certifications, and all 117 AWS services that store customer data offer the ability to encrypt that data.
* **Fastest pace of innovation**: With AWS, you can leverage the latest technologies to experiment and innovate more quickly. We are continually accelerating our pace of innovation to invent entirely new technologies you can use to transform your business. For example, in 2014, AWS pioneered the serverless computing space with the launch of AWS Lambda, which lets developers run their code without provisioning or managing servers. And AWS built Amazon SageMaker, a fully managed machine learning service that empowers everyday developers and scientists to use machine learning–without any previous experience.
* **Most proven operational expertise**: AWS has unmatched experience, maturity, reliability, security, and performance that you can depend upon for your most important applications. For over 14 years, AWS has been delivering cloud services to millions of customers around the world running a wide variety of use cases. AWS has the most operational experience, at greater scale, of any cloud provider.

## What 

### Overview

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a subsidiary of **Amazon** providing **on-demand cloud computing platforms** and **APIs** to individuals, companies, and governments, on a **metered pay-as-you-go** basis. 

These cloud computing web services provide a variety of basic abstract technical infrastructure and **distributed computing** building blocks and tools. 

* One of these services is **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud** (EC2), which allows users to have at their disposal a **virtual cluster of computers**, available all the time, through the Internet. 
* AWS's version of virtual computers emulates most of the attributes of a real computer, including 
	* hardware **central processing units** (CPUs) and **graphics processing units** (GPUs) for processing;
	* local/**RAM** memory; 
	* hard-disk/**SSD storage**; 
	* a choice of operating systems; 
	* networking; and 
	* pre-loaded application software such as 
		* **web servers**, 
		* **databases**, and 
		* **customer relationship management** (CRM).

The AWS technology is implemented at **server farms** throughout the world, and maintained by the Amazon subsidiary. Fees are based on a combination of usage (known as a "Pay-as-you-go" model), hardware, operating system, software, or networking features chosen by the subscriber required **availability**, **redundancy**, **security**, and service options. Subscribers can pay for a single virtual AWS computer, a dedicated physical computer, or clusters of either. As part of the subscription agreement, Amazon provides security for subscribers' systems. AWS operates from many global geographical regions including 6 in North America.

Amazon markets AWS to subscribers as a way of obtaining large scale computing capacity more quickly and cheaply than building an actual physical server farm. All services are billed based on usage, but each service measures usage in varying ways. As of 2017, AWS owns a dominant 33% of all cloud (**IaaS**, **PaaS**) while the next two competitors Microsoft and Google have 18%, 9% respectively according to Synergy Group.

### Services

As of 2020, AWS comprises more than 175[11] products and services including 

* **computing**, 
* **storage**, 
* **networking**, 
* **database**, 
* **analytics**, 
* **application services**, 
* **deployment**, 
* **management**, 
* **mobile**, 
* **developer tools**, and 
* tools for the **Internet of Things**. 

The most popular include 

* **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud** (EC2), 
* **Amazon Simple Storage Service** (Amazon S3), and 
* **AWS Lambda** (a **serverless function** enabling serverless **ETL** e.g. between instances of EC2 & S3).

Most services are not exposed directly to end users, but instead offer functionality through APIs for developers to use in their applications. Amazon Web Services' offerings are accessed over **HTTP**, using the **REST** architectural style and **SOAP** protocol for older APIs and exclusively **JSON** for newer ones.
