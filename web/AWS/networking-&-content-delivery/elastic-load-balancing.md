## What 

### Overview

Elastic Load Balancing **automatically** distributes **incoming application traffic** across multiple targets, such as **Amazon EC2 instances**, **containers**, **IP addresses**, **Lambda functions**, and **virtual appliances**. It can handle the varying load of your application traffic in a single Availability Zone or across multiple Availability Zones. Elastic Load Balancing offers four types of load balancers that all feature the high availability, automatic scaling, and robust security necessary to make your applications fault tolerant.
