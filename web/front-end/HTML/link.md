# `<link>`: The External Resource Link element

## Why 

在制作Anki Template的一行代码，使得卡片词语高亮了。

```
<link href="_youdao.css" rel="stylesheet">
```




## What

The `<link>` tag defines the **relationship** between the current document and an external resource. 

This element is most commonly used to link to **stylesheets**, but is also used to establish **site icons** (both "favicon" style icons and icons for the home screen and apps on mobile devices) among other things.


## How 

* **href**: Specifies the location of the linked document
* **rel**(relationship): Required. Specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document
