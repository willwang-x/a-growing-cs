e.g. API is a web based tool to easily access **information**, which is extracted from the core system. In case of Open Banking API that would mean that bank would expose information to the API, which can be accessed through specific functions. The only thing, which developers will need to do will be registering on the bank's API platform and receive a token, which later on will be used to recognise the developer — just like a policeman is carrying a badge or fireman a red hat.



> An application program interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. Basically, **an API specifies how software components should interact**. Additionally, APIs are used when programming graphical user interface (GUI) components.
