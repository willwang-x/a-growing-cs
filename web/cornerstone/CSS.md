> **Cascading Style Sheets** (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the **presentation** of a document written in a markup language like HTML. [[wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/CSS)]


## Why

> CSS is a **cornerstone** technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. [[wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/CSS)]

CSS is designed to **enable** the separation of **presentation** and **content**, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can 

* improve content **accessibility**, provide more **flexibility** and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, 
* enable multiple web pages to **share** formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces **complexity** and **repetition** in the structural content as well as 
* enabling the .css file to be **cached** to **improve** the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

## FAQs 

#### Q. Why CSS **right** align rule not working?

A: `Span` tags do not have `display: block by default`, so the text-align will not have an effect since the span tag will just occupy the width of its contents. Text alignment only works with a block-level element. [from] [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17367121/css-right-align-rule-not-working)
