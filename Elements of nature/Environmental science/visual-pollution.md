### overview

Visual pollution is **an aesthetic issue** and refers to the impacts of pollution that impair one's ability to **enjoy a pleasant view**. 

Visual pollution disturbs the visual areas of people by creating harmful changes in the natural environment. Billboards, open storage of trash, antennas, electric wires, buildings, and automobiles are often considered visual pollution.

An overcrowding of an area causes visual pollution. Visual pollution is defined as the whole of irregular formations, which are mostly found in nature.

Effects of exposure to visual pollution include distraction, eye fatigue, decreases in opinion diversity, and loss of identity.[3] It has also been shown to increase biological stress responses and impair balance.
