## Why 

> Get Organized Effectively. Without Stress.

GETTING THINGS DONE® is a personal productivity methodology that redefines how you approach your life and work.

[Why GTD works?](https://facilethings.com/blog/en/why-gtd-works)

1. **GTD has been developed, tested and empirically validated for many years, in real situations with real people.** David Allen discovered which self-management techniques worked and why they worked. The key here is the why, because if you know the principles by which a technique is effective, you can apply it accordingly.
1. **GTD is a formula to face anything you can encounter in your life.** It teaches you how to accept, evaluate, integrate, organize and reassess it when necessary.
1. **GTD is system-independent**, which means that you can adapt almost any organizational system with which you feel comfortable to implement its principles.
1. **GTD is something natural**. Although it is not simplistic, their practices are based on fundamental and universal principles. It is pure common sense.
1. **GTD is complete**. The five stages of the workflow let you keep your daily activity under control, while the six levels of perspective help you maintain the proper focus on your commitments.
1. **GTD lets you start with what you have**, just making an inventory of the commitments that make your current reality, before making any value judgment about it.
1. **GTD provides enough structure to cover a complex situation**, but also offers the flexibility needed to have a stable system valid for different situations and states of growth.
1. **GTD has been designed to deal with surprises and changes in priorities**, something that is definitely a constant in today’s world.
1. **GTD is not a time management tool**. Time is what it is, you cannot manage it. GTD allows you to manage yourself, your focus, and your actions.
1. GTD, as I started stating in this article, treats your work and personal life equally.

## How

#### Workflow 

> Five clear steps that apply order to chaos.


1. **CAPTURE**: Collect what has your attention. Write, record, or gather any and everything that has your attention into a collection tool.
1. **CLARIFY**: Process what it means. Is it actionable? If so, decide the next action and project (if more than one action is required). If not, decide if it is trash, reference, or something to put on hold.
1. **ORGANIZE**: Put it where it belongs. Park reminders of your categorized content in appropriate places.
1. **REFLECT**: Review frequently. Update and review all pertinent system contents to regain control and focus.
1. **ENGAGE**: Simply do. Use your trusted system to make action decisions with confidence and clarity.

The GTD workflow consists of five stages: capture, clarify, organize, reflect, and engage.[3] (The first edition used the names collect, process, organize, plan, and do; the descriptions of the stages are similar in both editions). Once all the material ("stuff") is captured (or collected) in the inbox,[1]:106 each item is clarified[1]:122 and organized[1]:141 by asking and answering questions about each item in turn as shown in the black boxes in the logic tree diagram. As a result, items end up in one of the eight oval end points in the diagram:

* in the trash
* on the someday/maybe list
* in a neat reference filing system
* on a list of tasks, with the outcome and next action defined if the "incomplete" is a "project" (i.e., if it will require two or more steps to complete it)
* immediately completed and checked off if it can be completed in **under two minutes**
* delegated to someone else and, if you want a reminder to follow up, added to a "waiting for" list
* on a context-based "next action" list if there is only one step to complete it
* on your calendar[1]:27
* Empty your inbox or inboxes daily or at least weekly ("in" to empty).[1]:122 Don't use your inbox as a "to do" list. Don't put clarified items back into the inbox.[1]:27 Emptying your inbox doesn't mean finishing everything. It just means applying the "capture, clarify, organize" steps to all your "stuff".[1]:27

Next, reflection (termed planning in the first edition) occurs. Multi-step projects identified above are assigned a desired outcome and a single "next action".[1]:191 Finally, a task from your task list is worked on ("engage" in the 2nd edition, "do" in the 1st edition) unless the calendar dictates otherwise. You select which task to work on next by considering where you are (i.e., the "context", such as at home, at work, out shopping, by the phone, at your computer, with a particular person), time available, energy available, and priority.[1]:204


#### Perspective

Allen emphasizes two key elements of GTD — **control** and **perspective**. The workflow is the center of the control aspect. The goal of the control processes in GTD is to get everything except the current task out of your head and into this trusted system external to your mind. He borrows a simile used in martial arts termed "**mind like water**". When a small object is thrown into a pool of water, the water responds appropriately with a small splash followed by quiescence. When a large object is thrown in the water again responds appropriately with a large splash followed by quiescence. The opposite of "mind like water" is a mind that never returns to quiescence but remains continually stressed by every input. With a trusted system and "mind like water" you can have a better perspective on your life. Allen recommends reflection from six levels, called "Horizons of Focus":

* Horizon 5: **Life**
* Horizon 4: Long-term **visions**
* Horizon 3: 1-2 year **goals**
* Horizon 2: Areas of **focus** and **accountability**
* Horizon 1: Current **projects**
* Ground: Current **actions**

Unlike some theories, which focus on top-down goal-setting, GTD works in the **opposite direction**. Allen argues that it is often difficult for individuals to focus on big picture goals if they cannot sufficiently control the day-to-day tasks that they frequently must face.[1]:54 By developing and using the trusted system that deals with day-to-day inputs, an individual can free up mental space to begin moving up to the next level.

Allen recommends scheduling a **weekly review**, reflecting on the different levels. The perspective gained from these reviews should drive one's priorities at the project level. **Priorities** at the project level in turn determine the priority of the individual tasks and commitments gathered during the workflow process. During a weekly review, determine the context for the tasks and put each task on its appropriate list. An example of grouping together similar tasks would be making a list of outstanding telephone calls, or the tasks/errands to perform while out shopping. Context lists can be defined by the set of tools available or by the presence of individuals or groups for whom one has items to discuss or present.

## What 

### Overview

Getting Things Done (GTD) is a **time management** method, described in the book of the same title by productivity consultant **David Allen**.

The GTD method rests on the idea of moving **planned tasks and projects out of the mind** by **recording** them externally and then breaking them into **actionable work items**. This allows **attention** to be focused on taking action on tasks, instead of **recalling** them.

First published in 2001, a revised edition of the book was released in **2015** to reflect the **changes** in information technology during the preceding decade.

### Implementation

Because hardware and software is changing so rapidly, GTD is deliberately technologically-neutral. (In fact, Allen advises people to start with a paper-based system.[4]) Many task management tools claim to implement GTD methodology[5] and Allen maintains a list of some technology that has been adopted in or designed for GTD. Some are designated "GTD Enabled", meaning Allen was involved in the design.[6]

### Summary

GTD is based on storing, tracking, and retrieving the information related to the things that need to get done. Mental blocks we encounter are caused by insufficient 'front-end' planning. This means thinking in advance, generating a series of actions which can later be undertaken without further planning. The mind's "reminder system" is inefficient and seldom reminds us of what we need to do at the time and place when we can do it. Consequently, the "next actions" stored by context in the "trusted system" act as an external support which ensures that we are presented with the right reminders at the right time. As GTD relies on external reminders, it can be seen as an application of the theories of **distributed cognition** or the **extended mind**.[7]

### Reception

In 2005, Wired called GTD a "new cult for the info age",[8] describing the enthusiasm for this method among information technology and knowledge workers as a kind of cult following. Allen's ideas have also been popularized through the Howard Stern Show (Stern referenced it daily throughout 2012's summer) and the Internet, especially via blogs such as 43 Folders,[9] Lifehacker,[10] and The Simple Dollar.[11]

In 2005, Ben Hammersley interviewed David Allen for The Guardian article titled "Meet the man who can bring order to your universe",[12] saying: "For me, as with the hundreds of thousands around the world who press the book into their friends' hands with fire in their eyes, Allen's ideas are nothing short of life-changing".

In 2007, Time Magazine called Getting Things Done the self-help business book of its time.[13]

In 2007, Wired ran another article about GTD and Allen,[14] quoting him as saying "the workings of an automatic transmission are more complicated than a manual transmission... to simplify a complex event, you need a complex system".

A paper in the journal Long Range Planning by Francis Heylighen and Clément Vidal of the Free University of Brussels showed "recent insights in psychology and cognitive science support and extend GTD's recommendations".[7]

#### Q: What is Two-Minute Rule?

A: Processing is the stage of the GTD workflow in which **you make decisions**. You get all the stuff you have collected and, one by one, decide what are you going to do with them.

For you to decide, you must first define clearly what each item is. Once you have a clear and specific statement of the desired result, the first question is whether you need to take action or not. If the answer is yes, the next thing is to decide **what the next action is**.

Here is where the famous **Two-Minute Rule** comes in: If the next action can be done in two minutes or less, do it now, although it is not an urgent or high-priority task.

It does not need to take two minutes exactly, it may take three or five. If you have to read a short text to make the following decision, read it. If you have to send an email or make a quick call, just do it.

If you do not complete the result with that action, identify the next action and process it following the same criteria: **If you need less than two minutes, do it; if not, defer it or delegate it**.

In short, if doing a task will take less time than processing it, organizing it in your lists and tracking it timely, it is much more efficient to do it the first time it is in your hands.

The Two-Minute Rule can **greatly improve your productivity**, making your projects move forward incessantly and preventing many small things get to overload your system.
