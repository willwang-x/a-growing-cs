## Why 

> Get Organized Effectively. Without Stress.

GETTING THINGS DONE® is a personal productivity methodology that redefines how you approach your life and work.

[Why GTD works?](https://facilethings.com/blog/en/why-gtd-works)

1. **GTD has been developed, tested and empirically validated for many years, in real situations with real people.** David Allen discovered which self-management techniques worked and why they worked. The key here is the why, because if you know the principles by which a technique is effective, you can apply it accordingly.
1. **GTD is a formula to face anything you can encounter in your life.** It teaches you how to accept, evaluate, integrate, organize and reassess it when necessary.
1. **GTD is system-independent**, which means that you can adapt almost any organizational system with which you feel comfortable to implement its principles.
1. **GTD is something natural**. Although it is not simplistic, their practices are based on fundamental and universal principles. It is pure common sense.
1. **GTD is complete**. The five stages of the workflow let you keep your daily activity under control, while the six levels of perspective help you maintain the proper focus on your commitments.
1. **GTD lets you start with what you have**, just making an inventory of the commitments that make your current reality, before making any value judgment about it.
1. **GTD provides enough structure to cover a complex situation**, but also offers the flexibility needed to have a stable system valid for different situations and states of growth.
1. **GTD has been designed to deal with surprises and changes in priorities**, something that is definitely a constant in today’s world.
1. **GTD is not a time management tool**. Time is what it is, you cannot manage it. GTD allows you to manage yourself, your focus, and your actions.
1. GTD, as I started stating in this article, treats your work and personal life equally.

## How

#### Workflow 

> Five clear steps that apply order to chaos.


1. **CAPTURE**: Collect what has your attention. Write, record, or gather any and everything that has your attention into a collection tool.
1. **CLARIFY**: Process what it means. Is it actionable? If so, decide the next action and project (if more than one action is required). If not, decide if it is trash, reference, or something to put on hold.
1. **ORGANIZE**: Put it where it belongs. Park reminders of your categorized content in appropriate places.
1. **REFLECT**: Review frequently. Update and review all pertinent system contents to regain control and focus.
1. **ENGAGE**: Simply do. Use your trusted system to make action decisions with confidence and clarity.

#### Perspective

Allen emphasizes two key elements of GTD — **control** and **perspective**. The workflow is the center of the control aspect. The goal of the control processes in GTD is to get everything except the current task out of your head and into this trusted system external to your mind. He borrows a simile used in martial arts termed "**mind like water**". When a small object is thrown into a pool of water, the water responds appropriately with a small splash followed by quiescence. When a large object is thrown in the water again responds appropriately with a large splash followed by quiescence. The opposite of "mind like water" is a mind that never returns to quiescence but remains continually stressed by every input. With a trusted system and "mind like water" you can have a better perspective on your life. Allen recommends reflection from six levels, called "Horizons of Focus":

* Horizon 5: **Life**
* Horizon 4: Long-term **visions**
* Horizon 3: 1-2 year **goals**
* Horizon 2: Areas of **focus** and **accountability**
* Horizon 1: Current **projects**
* Ground: Current **actions**

Unlike some theories, which focus on top-down goal-setting, GTD works in the **opposite direction**. Allen argues that it is often difficult for individuals to focus on big picture goals if they cannot sufficiently control the day-to-day tasks that they frequently must face.[1]:54 By developing and using the trusted system that deals with day-to-day inputs, an individual can free up mental space to begin moving up to the next level.

Allen recommends scheduling a **weekly review**, reflecting on the different levels. The perspective gained from these reviews should drive one's priorities at the project level. **Priorities** at the project level in turn determine the priority of the individual tasks and commitments gathered during the workflow process. During a weekly review, determine the context for the tasks and put each task on its appropriate list. An example of grouping together similar tasks would be making a list of outstanding telephone calls, or the tasks/errands to perform while out shopping. Context lists can be defined by the set of tools available or by the presence of individuals or groups for whom one has items to discuss or present.

## What 

### Overview

Getting Things Done (GTD) is a **time management** method, described in the book of the same title by productivity consultant **David Allen**.

The GTD method rests on the idea of moving **planned tasks and projects out of the mind** by **recording** them externally and then breaking them into **actionable work items**. This allows **attention** to be focused on taking action on tasks, instead of **recalling** them.

First published in 2001, a revised edition of the book was released in **2015** to reflect the **changes** in information technology during the preceding decade.
