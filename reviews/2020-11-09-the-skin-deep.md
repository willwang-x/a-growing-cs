> In 2014, we launched an interactive documentary project called {THE AND}. The premise was simple: film an emotional conversation between two people as they asked intimate questions, and invite the viewer into their emotional space. Our end goal is to build **the world’s first digital database of human connection** - a searchable public library of feelings, if you will. [[theskindeep.com](https://www.theskindeep.com/about-us)]

## Why

> I want to speak the way they do. It's been a life long struggle of mine, not being able to express myself vocally. I don't know if it's low vocabulary, or if there's a deeper reason. But my goodness if I could get advice from them about how to speak in a way that so perfectly gets their message across, i'd be so freaking grateful!
