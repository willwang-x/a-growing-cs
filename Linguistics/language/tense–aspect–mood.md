### Overview

Tense–aspect–mood (commonly abbreviated **tam**) or tense–modality–aspect (abbreviated as tma) is a group of **grammatical categories** which are important for the **understanding** of spoken or written content and which are marked in different ways by different languages.

TAM covers the expression of three major components of words which lead to or assist with a correct understanding of the speaker's meaning:[2]

* **Tense**—the location of the state or action in time, that is whether it is in the past, present or future.
* **Aspect**—the extension of the state or action in time, that is whether it is unitary (perfective), continuous or repeated (imperfective).
* **Mood or Modality**—the reality of the state or action, that is whether it is actual (realis), a possibility or a necessity (irrealis).

For example in English the word "walk" would be used in different ways for the different combinations of TAM:

* **Tense**: He walked (past), He walks (present), He will walk (future).
* **Aspect**: He walked (unitary), He was walking (continuous), He used to walk (repeated).
* **Mode**: I can walk (possibility), Walk faster! (necessity).
* In the last example, there is no difference in the articulation of the word although it is being used in a different way, one for conveying information, the other for instructing.
