## Why 

南美洲的安第斯秃鹰重达15公斤，翼展为3米，是能够在高空飞翔的最重的鸟类。最近，科学家将摄像头绑在八只秃鹰身上，震惊地发现这些鸟在飞行时，竟然只用**1％的时间挥动翅膀**。 其中，有一只鸟飞了**五个多小时，距离160公里，整个过程没有拍打过一次翅膀**，也就是说，在5个小时的飞行过程中，它的翅膀是不动的。这意味着，这种鸟类一定具有识别气流的本领，靠着上升气流滑翔，以便节省能量。就好比人类极限运动中的翼装飞行，也是不能挥动翅膀的。

## What 

### Overview

The Andean condor (Vultur gryphus) is a **South American bird** in the **New World vulture** family **Cathartidae** and is the **only member** of the genus Vultur. Found in the Andes mountains and adjacent Pacific coasts of western South America, the Andean condor is the largest flying bird in the world by combined measurement of weight and wingspan. It has a maximum wingspan of 3.3 m (10 ft 10 in)[2] exceeded only by the wingspans of four water birds—the roughly 3.5 m (11 ft 6 in) maximum of the wandering albatross, southern royal albatross, great white pelican and Dalmatian pelican.[3]

It is a large black vulture with a ruff of white feathers surrounding the base of the neck and, especially in the male, large white patches on the wings. The head and neck are nearly featherless, and are a dull red color, which may flush and therefore change color in response to the bird's emotional state. In the male, there is a wattle on the neck and a large, dark red comb or caruncle on the crown of the head. The female condor is smaller than the male, an exception to the rule among birds of prey.

The condor is primarily a scavenger, feeding on carrion. It prefers large carcasses, such as those of deer or cattle. It reaches sexual maturity at five or six years of age and nests at elevations of up to 5,000 m (16,000 ft), generally on inaccessible rock ledges. One or two eggs are usually laid. It is one of the world's **longest-living birds**, with a lifespan of over **70 years** in some cases.

The Andean condor is a national symbol of **Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru** and plays an important role in the folklore and mythology of the Andean regions. The Andean condor is considered vulnerable by the IUCN.[1] It is threatened by habitat loss and by secondary poisoning from carcasses killed by hunters. Captive breeding programs have been instituted in several countries.

### Ecology and behavior

The condor soars with its wings held horizontally and its primary feathers bent upwards at the tips.[22] The lack of a large sternum to anchor its correspondingly large flight muscles physiologically identifies it as primarily being a soarer. **It flaps its wings on rising from the ground, but after attaining a moderate elevation it flaps its wings very rarely, relying on [thermals](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Thermal#) to stay aloft.[37] [Charles Darwin](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Charles_Darwin) commented on having watched them for half an hour without once observing a flap of their wings.[38] It prefers to roost on high places from which it can launch without major wing-flapping effort. Andean condors are often seen soaring near rock cliffs, using the heat thermals to aid them in rising in the air.[39] Flight recorders have shown that “75% of the birds' flapping was associated with take-off”, and that it “flaps its wings just 1% of the time during flight”.[40] The proportion of time for flapping is more for short flights. Flapping between two thermal glides is more than flapping between two slope glides.**[41]

Like other New World vultures, the Andean condor has the unusual habit of urohidrosis: it often empties its cloaca onto its legs and feet. A cooling effect through evaporation has been proposed as a reason for this behavior, but it does not make any sense in the cold Andean habitat of the bird.[11] Because of this habit, their legs are often streaked with a white buildup of uric acid.[26]

There is a well-developed social structure within large groups of condors, with competition to determine a 'pecking order' by body language, competitive play behavior, and vocalizations.[42] Generally, mature males tend to be at the top of the pecking order, with post-dispersal immature males tending to be near the bottom.[3]
